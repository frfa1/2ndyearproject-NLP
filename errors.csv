7,"""Rainbow"" was a hard album for me to review. I love Johnny Cash, and to give anything that he has done less than 4 stars is tough for me. ""Rainbow"" was released in 1985 and was Cash's last album for Columbia. Veteran Memphis producer Chips Moman was given the honors this time around. Chips Moman had produced some incredible R&B hits, as well as bringing Willie Nelson to the masses with ""Always on my Mind."" However, this pairing doesn't work as well.  The material is weak and some quite ill-suited for Cash. ""Easy Street"" sounds contrived as Johnny Cash tries to relate to being a millionaire who's having a bad day. PLEEEEZ. On ""Love Me Like You Used To"" Cash sounds as bored singing it as I did listening to it. Sad. The album has three real good moments though. The opener ""I'm Leaving Now"" is a great lead track that Cash wrote about ""The System"" not a woman. Cut two is Kris Kristofferson's ""Here Comes That Rainbow Again"" which is an uplifting story told well. Cash's cover of CCR's ""Have You Ever Seen the Rain"" stands out also. This was the last digital download I needed to complete my collection. Now you know why.",negative,positive
8,"This was the very last original album from Johnny Cash to be released on Columbia records, after you listen to it you'll see why. A few good gems are on this, like his version of the CCR classic ""Have you ever seen the rain?"" but all in all this album is just lame. BUT I will say this......he then signed to Mercury records and made 5....yes 5 totally awesome CDs!  Buy all 5 of those merucry releases......1. Johnny cash is coming to Town....2. Water from the Wells of Home....3. Classic Cash '88 (re-recordings of his big hits)....4. Boom-chicka-Boom.....5. The Mystery of Life.",negative,positive
9,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Battlefield rendition of the series' many games' different themes. Battlefield 2 and Bad Company being the most prominent, the sequences are very well integrated and recording quality is amazing.

The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the very long, and very odd section of percussion only, about halfway through the song. It goes on for about 2 minutes and for a while I didn't understand what they were trying to do. I then figured that it was probably their attempt at the Battlefield 3 and 4 theme. But no, it's not. The album came out even before Bad Company 2 did... It doesn't ruin the overall experience entirely, but it was something that bothered me that I thought was worth noting. Otherwise, it's a great piece!",positive,negative

26,"If you love Jo Dee Messina- buy this cd.  Simply for the fact that it's new music from her and she is a fantastic singer and artist.  As a stand alone cd, it's not bad.  Probably the weakest of the ""Unmistakable"" trilogy in my opinion, but still with some good points.  ""Heaven was Needing a Hero"" and ""Get up Again"" are both great songs, with ""Get Up Again"" a throwback to an ""I'm Alright"" life is good anthem song. ""I like Me"" has promise but it's a bit all over the place.  ""How do you get High"" isn't as scandalous as it sounds, in fact, it really doesn't say anything as a song.  People get their fixes from different places.  Okay.  So..... ""Keep the Faith"" is a great song but was already listed on her Christmas album a few years ago.  ""That's God"" is well-written but not a radio hit.  As a whole, not a bad cd, but nothing you want to sing out loud and jam to in the car.  But new music from Jo Dee Messina after waiting for five years is truly priceless....",negative,positive

37,"I bought this digital download (I would rather have a physical CD!) because I love some of Joe Hisaishi's music from watching a few of Miyazaki's cartoons.  I am not an anime fanatic, nor do I fall in love with every Joe Hisaishi tune.  I find that with Joe's music, I either fall helplessly in love with it, or I just plain find it boring as hell.  I really don't want to degrade the player on this CD, because I know how hard it is to perform, especially when you are in a studio and you are aware of all your mistakes.  This player is good, plays all the right notes.  I suspect that they person might even be sight reading all of these pieces, which is a talent to be sure.  Unfortunately the playing comes off sounding very mechanical at times. Either way, there are some real gems on this album.  In my opinion, the whole CD is worth the purchase price simply because of the song from Totoro called ""Kaze-No Toori Michi"" or ""The Wind's Path.""  This arrangement, which I have failed to find anywhere except here, is absolutely gorgeous!!  Whoever arranged this is simply brilliant!  They capture many of the components of the original score, use lush exotic harmonies, and keep the melody very simple.  The introductory repetitive left hand passage keeps the piece moving giving it an undercurrent of longing, sadness, or maybe just expressing the unbiased non-emotional qualities of nature and the wind?  I don't know, but it reminds me of what a progressive rock keyboardist might do with it like Keith Emerson, or Eddie Jobson.  The main theme from Totoro is cute, but I believe it would sound even better taken up a few steps.  It's played without the happy qualities that it should be played with, and again, very mechanical.  Regardless, I did give it 5 stars because it has many redeeming qualities.",positive,negative

184,"It's surprising how many classic Christmas LPs have never been re-mastered for conversion to CD, none more so than Christmas Carols by Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra which first came out in 1958 as mono Dot 3148 containing: White Christmas; It Came Upon A Midnight Clear; O Holy Night; Deck The Halls; The First Noel; Joy To The World; Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful); Silent Night; God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen; O Tannenbaum (O Christmas Tree); Hark! The Herald Angels Sing; Faith Of Our Fathers; Jingle Bells; O Little Town Of Bethlehem.

Over the years with subsequent reissues there were 3 different covers with the original having a mostly yellow cover and a stylized drawing of a sleigh inside a large red oval (which made it a bit odd in that Sleigh Ride itself was not among the tracks). In 1959 the same album came out in stereo (Dot 3148/25148), with a glossy front cover, ""Billy Vaughn"" in white on a green background and gold-embossed ""Christmas Carols"" on red, with a gold embossed border. When re-issued again a few years later the cover was a flat red, the ""Dot"" logo in its usual 3 colors situated in a green circle, ""Billy Vaughn"" in white and ""Christmas Carols"" in yellow. Charting-wise it made it to # 145 on Billboard's Christmas charts in 1962 and # 101 in 1967.

Some of the tracks have appeared on these CDs: Christmas With Billy Vaughn & His Yuletide Orchestra - 9 of the same tracks in a 10-track 2006 release that includes Auld Lang Syne; Christmas Classics, a 1996 release from Chicago Music Company that contains the same 10 sides; and Christmas Song, a 2012 release from Essential Media Group containing the same line-up. None of these include God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen or White Christmas, nor can I say with any certainty that they are all the same original 1958 renditions.

Why that has never been re-mastered for CD is a puzzle since Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra wasn't just some run-of-the-mill band back then. After being part of the highly-successful Dot vocal quartet known as The Hilltoppers, who had 15 hit singles for the label from 1952 to 1954, he left to form the in-house Dot orchestra in 1954 that would go on to back the vast majority of Dot artists on so many hit singles and albums (e.g. Pat Boone, Gail Storm, The Fontane Sisters, Tab Hunter, Nick Todd (Pat Boone's brother), and many more for years to come.

In the midst of all that, he and his orchestra would rack up some 31 hit singles of their own from their first, Melody Of Love in late 1954/early 1955, to their last in 1967, I Love You (And You Love Me), while selling albums in the millions, 4 of which went Gold: The Golden Instrumentals (1956); Sail Along Silv'ry Moon (1958); Blue Hawaii (1959); and Theme From A Summer Place (1960).

A great deal of his music is available on CD, so why are they dragging their heels with his premier Christmas album?",positive,negative
185,"I've been sorting through boxes of old Christmas albums and commenting on most that are listed here at Amazon, lamenting the fact that many have never been re-mastered for conversion to CD, since these were the ones us old duffers recall most fondly. But my surprise at some of the ones overlooked now has a Number 1 in my book: Christmas Carols by Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra which first came out in 1958 as mono Dot 3148 containing: White Christmas; It Came Upon A Midnight Clear; O Holy Night; Deck The Halls; The First Noel; Joy To The World; Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful); Silent Night; God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen; O Tannenbaum (O Christmas Tree); Hark!

226,"Imagine: Guitars that blaze with no reserve, while at the same time keeping the good riffs alive. Drums that stay simple but never let up. Skillful, reverberated vocals that melt steel(e). That certain air about an album that makes the discerned listener think ""80's!"" and throw up the horns instinctively....
These things were part of a style of metal that's now considered stale, untalented, retro, and anything else of the like to many people, shamefully many who are serious fans of metal. The style is straight up meat-and-potatoes heavy metal with no frills and no apologies. A forgotten flag proudly carried in the past by bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Accept, Queensryche, Saint, W.A.S.P., Stormwitch, Fifth Angel....and Sacred Warrior. Make no mistake, Sacred Warrior's debut, Rebellion, is not black metal, death metal, technical progressive algebra metal, beach metal, astral techno Jupiter moon metal, carpenter metal, symphonic metal, core-metal, coffee mug metal, or anything else except guitar heavy, scream filled, in your face American traditional/power metal in the vein of the masters. In other words, this 1988 album serves as a great reminder of just why most metal fans got into metal in the first place. The songs here are simple, but extremely hooky, and always chock full of ultra great, over the top guitar playing and singing. There'll be no sheep heads flying off the stage, no deep nihilistic misanthropic whitebread message, no 'artful' avante garde snobbiness, no crap at all to be found. What there will be is a lot of banging of head due to the solid songwriting to be found here and trying to sing along with vocalist Rey Parra, a criminally overlooked belter in the style of Geoff Tate and Michael Kiske who can easily hold his own with the giants.
Although there is a bit of variation in the overall quality of the songs on Rebellion, there are no real weak ones at all. There is a silly moment or two, such as in the opener, Black Metal - which doesn't seem to have a single thing to do with black metal at all, but does have a good line or two denouncing conformity within metal ('You try so hard to be like everyone else'). A weak melody here and there is also present, but Rey Parra's signature vibrato-drenched screams at the end close it off on a good note. Aside from the B-grade opener every single song is a winner, with some more obvious highlights in some places. Roughly half the album can be classified in the latter group, starting with the third song, Mad, Mad World. This song is simply an unbelievable piece of hard rock influenced, galloping heavy metal. The vocal layering in the chorus is enough to make the song amazing on it's own, but there's also the shredding of guitarist Bruce Swift (easily one of the most underrated metal guitarists), the sledgehammer headbanging part after the second chorus, and some extra virtuosoic vocal work by Parra after the solo.. the man can almost be seen red-faced, singing so hard his vocal cords are sticking out of his throat. Even the lyrics (which speak out about the deceptive and superficial nature of society) are pretty great, which is a good thing. Not that the content itself of the album is bad - there are a lot of uplifting messages of encouragement (Children of the Light, title track), warning (Master of Lies, Stay Away from Evil), and glorification of Jesus Christ (every song). The band's lyric writing ability is simply somewhat pedestrian on this album, so while there is always at least one good line to be found, overall the lyrics are almost too simple and minimalistic. Thankfully, however, they never get awkward or silly, except for a little bit in the aforementioned Black Metal, with the chorus sporting the line, 'Long hair, parted between the eyes/Silk pants, wrapped tight round your thighs/Each day goes by, you're living a dream'. Yes, there's no questioning that it was 1988...
Going back to the rest of the songs, not each song is the best of them, but every song has at least one great <i>defining</i> moment in it (usually the chorus) that really helps make the song, which is why Rebellion is such a solid album. Then, some songs are just top quality, such as Mad, Mad World, Stay Away From Evil, which is a shorter song but has some good riffwork and one of the more infectious choruses to be found, Famine, a mid paced song that harkens directly back to Number of the Beast/Piece of Mind era Iron Maiden and features Rey Parra doing his very best Geoff Tate impersonation, and The Heavens are Calling, another galloper with some fiery solos and more catchy vocal work. The interesting thing about the chorus vocals on this album - like on The Heavens are Calling - is that many times instead of singing different verses with a set melody, there will be only one or two actual lines in the chorus, but introduced by 'general' vocalizations, like a 'Whooaaa, ohh ohhh', which helps give Rebellion a refreshing flair. There is also Children of the Light and Master of Lies, both excellent speed metal songs with big chorus hooks carried by Parra's huge vocal range and Bruce Swift laying down riff after riff and solo after solo. On a small negative note, the drums sound a bit odd on the faster songs - that's not to say that Tony Velazquez does a bad job behind the drumkit, but the drums just seem to be more engineered for the more midpaced, anthemic songs, and so when there's double bass pounding, the drum triggers stick out like a sore thumb. Of course, it could just be chalked up as part of the album's charm depending on your opinion.
The rest of the songs could be considered average, but not filler, which is important when an album has only 11 songs or under. Regardless, there's still something incredibly cool about each one, like the big riff/solo set in the closer, Sword of Victory.
Rebellion is the kind of album everybody who enjoys metal should have at least a few of. There's nothing exactly like being refreshed with straight up well played heavy metal and that's what Sacred Warrior plays best.",positive,negative

279,"This mp3 download is of the original 1958 RCA VICTOR LP.

.
As far back as 1953, RCA VICTOR experimented with two track recordings. Starting in '55, this company issued a series of stereo reel tapes and when Westrex developed a practical system for stereo LPs a couple of years later, RCA got into this format in a big way. In 1958, their first full year of LIVING STEREO album production, they issued about 200 titles. BOB AND RAY THROW A STEREO SPECTACULAR (LSP-1773) is one of these pioneering records.

It's really a chance for the label to demo this new process and offer samples of their growing stereo catalog. Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding's bits sprinkled throughout the program are excuses for various sound effects. On these segments, cross-channel panning is used to simulate movement across the sound stage. Stereo was a novelty that year, so the wider the spacial effect, the bigger the ""wow!"" factor.

RANDOM NOTES
On ""B & R at the Castle"" we meet hunchbacked 'Gore' (Bob as Karloff) and 'Dr. Akhbar' (Bob doing Peter Lorre). He's Director of Bob and Ray Scientific Research and we're first shown Dr. A.'s experimental fly, 'Neil.'

The ""Minuet on the Rocks"" excerpt is boogiefied Paderewski, with Skitch pounding away at a honky tonk piano. Behind the creaky door of ""The Round Room  is a bagpipe marching band. Besides many unusual percussion instruments in the Schory's ""Buck Dance,"" we also hear tap shoes. Lena's ""New-Fangled Tango"" is a mono 'live' at the Waldorf performance that has the audience giggling. Within the ballroom on ""The Thing"" is a clock with a screaming human pendulum. ""Second Hungarian Rhapsody"" is an edited version of one of the most insane oompah band recordings ever made.

Richard Leibert was Radio City's first-ever organist. His high output holiday song at the keys really gives your speakers a workout. If ""Song of the Volga Boatmen"" sounds like Glenn Miller, there's a good reason. Several Miller alumni play on this recreation of the original Bill Finegan arrangement. The experiments in Dr. A.'s ""Laboratory"" are samples from RCA's sound effects library.

Xavier's Cugat's fourth wife, Abbe Lane (""Whatever Lola Wants"") is a Jewish girl from Brooklyn, born Abigail Lassman in 1932. ""The Ox Drivers"" reflects a popular trend of that day, folk music. Album-closing ""The End"" has shrunk-in-size Bob and Ray as the mad doctor's final experiment.

THIS IS THE BEST CHRISTMAS ALBUM YOU'LL EVER HEAR OR LOVE! As amazing as it is...you deserve the best possible copy/quality of this recording as you can get!!! For now, that appears to be on used vinyl. This download will do for now and is probably worth the money to download, but, with any luck, someone will find the masters and make us fans, all happy! However, this download will save you the bother of doing the transfer from vinyl yourself until a better quality download or edition on CD comes along!

The title cut, ""Christmas Is For The Family"" and ""I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day"" are cult Christmas classics that are revered by Christmas music fans and a mandatory addition to their collection after you've heard them the first time. I've never heard another rendition of either song done so perfectly. You'll love these two and they will easily make it into your Christmas music rotation. Frankly, either or both should have been released as a singles but, the label (Design Records) was not a ""single"" oriented label. Their catalog pertains to popular artists singing songs that are lesser known than their hits or their early recordings after an artist made it big or accomplished singers/musicians doing covers of big tunes. Needless to say, some of these LP's, like this one were destined to become classics. Had ""Christmas Is For The Family"" or ""I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day"" been released as singles the year this LP was released, either would have done very well and would now be staples of Christmas music rotation on radio airwaves both local free and satelite radio and more than likely given Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"" a run for it's money as the biggest selling Christmas records of all time. ""May Santa Fill Our Hearts"" is another cut on this LP that is another cult classic, and I've never heard another cover of the song. There is some great original material on this LP as well as standards.

On ""Christmas Is For The Family"", side one is ""Popular"" Christmas Classics with stunning lush arrangements wrapped around Dennis Day's voice with full studio orchestra, featuring Lou Hollingsworth at the Wurlitzer Organ, and the Vail Boys Choir. Side two is more of a ""Traditional"" Christmas Classics that you might hear in Church, mostly done with Lou at the Organ and the boys choir again, in arrangements to stir emotions in even the coldest of souls at Christmas Time.

Jack Benny's appearance as ""Santa"" playing the violin on the cover, as well as Jack playing, speaking and singing at the begining and the end of side one and the beginning of side two and another little cameo at the end is a nice bit of nostalgia from when Dennis used to appear regularly on Jack's Television Show that I'm sure was designed to boost LP sales.

Now, aside from that, this is the finest Christmas album you'll ever hear from a man with a voice that was a gift that was meant to sing Christmas Songs, Irish Folk Songs, as well as be shared with the masses.

I am on my 3rd pressing of this Christmas Classic and 4 years ago, I spent over a month, finding pristine copies of this LP to give as Christmas gifts to members of my family who have fond memories of Christmas due to this fine recording.

Unfortunately, IT'S NOT available on CD, YET! I just wish someone could find the masters and have enough sense to re-release it so we can all enjoy this amazing Christmas Classic. Until such time, you'll have to do like I did...get one coverted to CD to get you by till the real thing comes along.",positive,negative
331,"A 2003 release in an all-instrumental series on the Sona Rupa label of India/UK. All of the albums have similar instrumentation; this one features 2 players of the bansuri (bamboo) flute which makes it especially attractive for me. Other instruments are sarod, sitar, santoor, sarangi, shenai, and tabla and pakhwaj drums. The notes say that the recording was done 'live' with all the musicians together. Acoustic guitar and keyboard are used sparingly.

If you like one album in this series, you'll like them all (I have about 10). Instrumental songs which are rooted in classical musics of India (the raag of each is noted), but given contemporary ensemble arrangements, slightly like what you'd hear in a western jazz ensemble with the 'head' of the song and multiple solos. The resulting songs, most less than 10 minutes, are probably more accessible to the uninitiated western listener than the 'pure classical' musics of India.",positive,negative
339,"When it does come down to it, the cast of Glee has done some really pathetic covers. When I heard them recently do a cover of Whitney Houston's I Look To You, I really thought that they just really killed the rawness and the intimate appeal of the song. They've done the same idea when they've mixed two rock classics together into one song, by mixing Bon Jovi's Livin' On A Prayer, and the classic Rolling Stones anthem Start Me Up, it feels like the killjjoy of 2 die hard fans into one badly made opus. It feels like the songs from the Rock Of Ages musical feel like a better novelty to listen to than what the cast of Glee has done with beautiful songs. I also think the producers of Glee should try and deliver more original songs than the feeling of covers being more like gags with crescent rolls.

* Research Notes: Mantovani albums are a little difficult to research now for someone like myself who was not there to be collecting them at the time.  While I have about 50 Mantovani LP albums, most from my parent's collection and some purchased used, most do not have dates printed on them anywhere.  The current best source of album listings that I have found is at[...].  Wikipedia's Mantovani page lists 2 additional Christmas albums: Christmas Carols, London LL 913; and Merry Christmas to All of You, Decca 66445009 (1963).  I cannot find any other references to either of these albums anywhere.  There is an extensive LP (and even old 78s) listing on the mantovani-orchestra(dot)com site, but it does not include many US albums that I own and it appears that the catalog numbers there are non-US.

350,"The 1964 RCA VICTOR LP entitled Let's Ring the Bells ALL AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE (LPM/LST-2914) is a souvenir of the New York World's Fair. It includes an album-sized four page booklet, ""Of Bells and Carillons,"" from which comes much of the trivia here.

The RCA and Coca-Cola pavilions were close neighbors at the Fair. Victor's John Klein was also musical director for Coke and the Carillonneur of their pavilion's centerpiece, what was then the world's largest carillon: a 120-foot tower housing 610 chimes capable of many different tones: Flemish bells, Harp, Lute, Aeolian, Baroque, Celestial and several others.

The original carillons were far simpler devices that required many ringers to operate a few roped bells that weighed tons. Modern carillons are electro-mechanical marvels controlled by keyboards, stops and pedals, their sounds created by miniature bronze bells weighing mere ounces instead of pounds or tons. The secret is a series of audio amplifiers and speakers. The Coca-Cola carillon had 57 directional speakers (stentors), some five-feet across, that projected 3,000 watts of amplified sound.

Principal recordings for ""All Around the Christmas Tree"" of Henry Ren&eacute;'s orchestra and chorus were made at Webster Hall in NYC. Master tapes, equipment and engineers then relocated to Flushing Meadow, Queens and the Coke pavilion, where Mr. Klein added his bells on a separate tape track. The results are nothing less than remarkable, what sounds like a concert of perfectly blended orchestra, voices and carillon.

One of the most unique holiday albums ever, this one gets a highest recommendation!

352,"Christmas Bells, with organist Richard Keys Biggs, is a rare find nowadays in any format.  It originally appeared in the 50s on a monaural LP (Capitol T-9013).  It is that edition which I found at Amazon (Sold by Looney Geeks).  Given the rarity of the recording, one must be prepared to accept pops and crackles, and there are a goodly sprinkling of those throughout both sides.  The sound, of course, is typical of the early days of high fidelity.  That said, the record is well worth owning if you can find a copy.  The carols are played with deep and heart-felt simplicity, with no fancy arranging.  The chimes are very well used to accentuate the simple directness of Biggs' interpretations of a goodly selection of the most beloved carols.  The only drawback with regard to the copy I received is that it was plainly advertised as an audio CD (which obviously it is not).  I had fully expected the item to be a remake by someone from the original vinyl, and am somewhat disappointed that such was not the case.  By and large, though, the quality of the disc is quite acceptable although the price ($24.95) iwas a bit steep, given that the disc is not in pristine condition.  Nevertheless, if you can find one, BUY IT!",positive,negative
353,I love the song Barely Breathing!,positive,negative
359,"I was skeptical when I heard about this compilation of music because, as a huge RUSH fan, I expected it to really fall short. Apparently DARKSTAR originally had a bunch of great, classic RUSH songs as the soundtrack, and due to some crappy Hollywood greed tactics by Universal, the Producers dumped the idea and replaced the songs with their own, custom scored music. It is amazing, and truly lives up to the expectations one would expect of a AAA touring act. The music ranges from eerie, ambient tracks to full out rockers.  Jimmy Pitts on keyboards is epic, his style more aligned to virtuosic guitar work like you'd expect from Vai, but the guitar neck laid out on a table for the talented Pitts to burn up with hand-played arpeggios and leads that seem impossible on keyboards. Likewise, Bill Bruce is phenomenal with his tasteful passages, grinding rhythms, and signature classical guitar riffs mixed with well written layered leads.  If you're a fan of Vai, Zappa, TSO, Rush, Yes, and all progressive, this is the record for you.",positive,negative
365,"Fats Domino was as meaningful as any other artist (except perhaps for Buddy Holly) in my early music appreciation days. I didn't have a lot of 45s in those years but there was more Fats than anyone. He remains a great favorite.
Two things led me to buying this single. One was that I never have owned it and as such had never heard the B side until I bought an ACE Fabulous Flips compilation years back. I don't have nearly the 45s I used to but I do have a jukebox to feed. The other is that ""Before I Grow Too Old"" is not on the 4 disc Imperial box. A sad oversight.
I rank ""Before I Grow Too Old"" in my top 10 Fats Domino songs. If  you still play 45s, seek this single out. The A side is no slouch either. If not I recommend the ACE Fabulous Flips Vol. 3",positive,negative

This version by Scott Finch is very decent, but seems a little uninspired. The guitar work is great, but just isn't quite there, and the singing is certainly missing in spots, however, this is a very decent version and is well worth $ .99.

423,"Don't let the name ""Foetus"" fool you--when I was first recommended Thirlwell's music, I though it was going to be some terrible goth or metal nonsense.  How wrong I was.

Everyone who knows me knows that I am almost pathologically obsessed with Thirlwell's musical output.  Despite his proclivity it seems like nobody knows who he is--and even when you find a Foetus fan (usually online) discussing his music they focus on some of his older stuff, like NAIL or HOLE.  The problem here is not that Thirlwell got worse over time--the problem is is that he attracted lot of fans of the overly broad designation of ""industrial music.""  The result is that many of those that do know who he is cling to the era when his sound was closer to early ""industrial"" and noise music.

If there is anything Thirlwell is not, it is being an artist that has the same sound over his entire career.  In some ways it's hard to believe that the same genius that created NAIL also produced this fantastic orchestral brilliance.  In fact, the Thirlwell of the past--usually wearing some guise, most famously the  ""Clint Ruin"" persona--seems radically different from the Thirlwell we see today.  Compare the pictures of Thirlwell back then standing amid impaled hog heads to him in a suit conducting for a live performance of Manorexia.  Thirlwell has never been content to stay in the same place.

Every Thirlwell album, then, is a delightful new surprise, and I had waited for this album in near-agony, and the delays only compounded by impatience.  Remember how excited you used to get near Christmas back during your childhood?  That's how I felt waiting for this album to finally arrive into my mailbox, except in this case, Christmas was delayed at least twice due to Santa Claus to finally get his sleigh painted the right color before leaving the North Pole. (This metaphor makes sense only to those that followed the delays of this album).  A little voice inside me wondered how Thirlwell could top LOVE, and how I'd probably be disappointed after all that waiting, because I'm just negative that way.  Foetus isn't often very uplifting to listen to, so I suppose I can be forgiven for my pessimism.  Fortunately, I was glad I was wrong--this may be Thirlwell's best album yet, and it's probably my favorite.  He took what made LOVE so good and made it even better.

HIDE is a concept album with held together by the themes of fear, paranoia, and uncertainty; lyrical references throughout are apocalyptic (particularly ""Oilfields"") and numerous references to fear-stirring events that were current during the album's production (e.g., ""anthrax in the envelope""), and it seems that Thirlwell envisioned the album as being the sountrack to a movie that exists only within his own head--which is something you may expect from an artist that already outputs fantastic cinematically-inspired pieces (check out Manorexia!) and has expressed a desire to score for a big-budget movie. Cosmetics, for example, comes across as a bombastic, operatic opening while O Putrid Sun sounds like something that would play to rolling credits after a downer of an ending.  Throughout Thirlwell adeptly mixes ""haunting"" with ""beautiful"" and does so over a large range of style.  I'll let other reviewers go more in-depth over the individual songs, they're better at describing them than I am.

Also, I forgot to describe the cover art.  For a lack of proper adjectives I'll close this review by stating that it's ""pretty friggin' awesome,"" which you can see for yourself.",positive,negative

It's simple, but its synth beats and ""yodeling"" chorus is instantly recognizable to anyone who was mentally cognizant at the time (it was in a Listerine commercial and an ad for one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies, notably). The composition really feels fun and yet heroic at the same time, making you think that it's deeper than it is. It's a shame that Baltimora died before he ever topped it, and even more of a shame that there are no really good covers of this song to carry on the legacy, but that's neither here nor there: If you want something a little cheesy and a lot of fun to dance to, pick up Tarzan Boy!",positive,negative
558,"It's 1979 and the Disco trend is in full swing.  Every song on the radio features chants, funky basslines, percussive breakdowns and whistles.  Some performers of this genre of music could either make the transition to the Post-Disco format and some could not.  Thankfully, Payne DID with an underground hit in 1982 entitled, ""In Motion"" on Sutra Records.  Prior to that, her last outing was this, her Capitol swansong.

On ""Hot,"" Capitol seemed to have locked her into a chugging, Latin-flavored, Anita Ward-ish ""Ring My Bell"" sound with the first single, ""Red Hot,"" but there was only one problem- the only bell being rung was the gong.  This was NOT a reflection on Payne, but on Capitol, her label, with its typical lack of artist promotion.  If you're a fan of traditional Disco formats, this album may be for YOU.

Despite sexy photography, festive uptempos and beautiful balladry, this album as well as its two predecessors (""Supernatural High"" and ""Stares and Whispers"") didn't even touch the Disco/Dance chart.  All three titles are worth exploring and are highly recommended.  Additionally, you won't need any Q-Tips for THIS kind of Payne in your ears!

Here's a little trivia for ya TOO:  Prior to her signing with Capitol, who offered her a better financial option, she was offered a deal with Philadelphia International Records under Gamble & Huff.  Sadly, she didn't opt for the latter which just MIGHT HAVE proved the more beneficial choice for her career.  :-(",positive,negative

633,"I first encountered Richard Campbell's work through the Rock Band video game, where his ""A Christmas Rock Medley"" was sold as an addon song for the game.  I loved the track and went looking for more.  I found Orpheus, listened to a few samples, and bought the album.

This has joined my list of favorite albums in just the few weeks I've had it.  It's a progressive rock concept album, like Rush's 2112 or Dream Theater's Metropolis Part 2.  It tells the story of Orpheus and Eurydice, a Greek myth about Orpheus, a legendary musician who marries a beautiful woman.  She is killed in an accident, and Orpheus goes to the underworld to beg the gods to return her to life.  Hades takes pity on him and agrees that he can have Eurydice back on the condition that he walk out of the underworld without looking behind him to see her face.  Orpheus leaves the underworld but looks back before Eurydice manages to join him, and she is condemned to the underworld.  A short snippet of another myth is brought in--Orpheus is killed by Thracians--and the chorus closes the tale.

The instrumentals are all performed by Campbell, who is veritable polymath of music: he plays drums, guitar, keyboard, and bass on this album.  He also wrote the arrangements, as well, and his enjoyment of Dream Theater shines through here; this album may not be as complicated as a typical DT track, but it could easily be mistaken for a side project from any of the members of DT.

725,"This CD is an introductory CD to a whole series of some 25 produced by Michael Haas and recorded and released by Decca.  I think it's one of the most important things that's happened in classical music recording in the past 20 years.  That's because Haas is a real scholar, and he has gone to great lengths to make this series as thorough as his Decca budget would allow, and to record music by a wide variety of composers  -- some who made it and some who didn't.  In fact, if you become interested in this topic, as I did, Haas has recently released an excellent book on this topic, published by Yale, I think.

The performances are all strong. This CD gives you short cuts by lots of composers, not complete works.  But it gives you an idea of the incredible richness of the (mostly Jewish) musical scene in Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia in the 1920's and early 1930's.",positive,negative

731,"This is an hour-long story about an improbable partnership between General Motors and Toyota to jointly run an auto plant in Fremont, California. The JV was formed in 1984 and ran the plant until its closing in April 2010.  It was called New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., but everyone called it ""NUMMI."" It's a fascinating narrative, with interviews of workers, labor leaders, management from the plant and business school faculty.  This is one of the best radio pieces you'll ever hear.  Although the two companies were fierce competitors, each needed the other at the time.  GM needed to learn how to build high-quality small cars efficiently.  Toyota had never made a car in America and wanted a local partner for its first plant here.  Toyota chose GM's Fremont assembly plant, which had been closed down as one of the worst-performing factories in the country.  Interviews with workers recounted incidents of drugs, sex, intentional sabotaging of cars, absenteeism so massive that managers would run down to the local bar to round up day workers, and constant labor-management fights.  Contrary to almost everyone's advice, Toyota re-hired the vast majority of what was reputed to be one of the worst work forces in the auto industry.  These blue-collar, hard-drinking American workers were sent to Japan to train alongside Japanese workers in Toyota City to learn the Toyota Way.  Tape from those trips revealed a remarkable transformation.  Almost from the day it opened, the NUMMI plant had the highest quality of any auto plant in the U.S.  Its operations were radically different from any auto plant in America.  During its lifetime, the plant produced 8 million high-quality cars, mostly Toyota Corollas.  This program tells how this transformation was accomplished, why GM failed to learn from it and why Toyota knew GM could not copy the Toyota Way (ultimately leading to GM's bankruptcy).  The story is told by Frank Langfit in a joint production by NPR and WBEZ/This American Life.",positive,negative

Walking Far from Home is a brilliant track that finally seems to give Sam a voice instead of the whisper we all know and love.  And what a voice!  Even though the song is amazing, this track seems to be a little over mastered.  And sadly that continues to the other two.
Summer in Savannah when played live has such depth to its sound.  Over-mastered and flat sound on the recording.
Hearing Biting your Tail this way scares me.

For the volume of a box fan's noise that I'd need, I didn't want the air flow that came with it.  I've tried a stand-alone white noise machine, but that particular one wasn't loud enough to mask anything, even on its highest volume.  So I looked for a CD of white noise or box fan sound effect.  Until I started looking, I didn't realize there were other ""colors"" of noise.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  It has a deeper or lower tone than white noise, so it doesn't sound as harsh, IMO.  I just wish I'd've found this cheap solution before I bought a box fan and a white noise machine!  I can still use the box fan, but the white noise machine is history now that I have this.",positive,negative

930,"For those of you old enough to remember the Rumiko Takahashi anime Maison Ikkoku, this song will sound spooky familiar. That's because this is a ""21st Century Version"" of the show's original opening title theme, titled ""Hello! Sadness"" in the United States. Both the original version and this new recording are performed by Saito Yuki.

The original song was released in 1986, with this version being released in 2007. That's a 21 year gap, guys and girls. Ignoring for a moment how old that makes me feel, I have to confess that I wasn't initially very keen on the new version. There's definitely a lot of nostalgia tied to the original recording, but that's not the only problem. 1980s J-pop has a very particular kind of sound, one that I grew fond of over my many viewings of Japanese anime from the era. There are some great synth elements to the original recording of ""Hello! Sadness"" that are simply missing from the new arrangement, with new elements being added in for flourish (such as the occasional touch of electric guitar). I suppose this was done to give it a more modern feeling.

After getting over the initial nostalgia shock, I really grew to appreciate the new recording. Saito's performance is still relaxed and beautiful, and the new arrangement is  just as moving now as the original was then. I sort of wish the album would have included the original cut as well -- you can't currently find it for sale on Amazon -- but that aside, the song is well worth it if you like melodic J-pop or were a fan of Maison Ikkoku.",positive,negative

Of course I bought it about 45 seconds after I read my email. It arrived in a timely fashion and I have felt complete ever since. The only problem is that, for whatever reason. when I get to Track 3 (Project Pitchfork) the CD catches about halfway through the song (a real travesty) and I am unable to listen to the rest of it. It is strange because #1 the CD was still in the plastic when it arrived, #2 I have a boss CD player in my car, and #3 it is only at that certain part on this one CD.

1175,"OK, everybody knows the deal with Charlie Hunter.  He plays either a 7 or 8 string custom guitar (mostly 7 these days) with some bass strings and some regular guitar strings, and fanned frets.  The set-up allows him to play the bass line and the guitar line simultaneously like some freak of nature.  Usually, though, he plays with a band and if you didn't know what was going on, you wouldn't realize that the guitarist and the bassist are the same guy, playing without overdubs.  On Public Domain, he plays unaccompanied, so there is nobody else to distract from the shear genius of his instrumental work.  The title of the album refers to the contents-- all of the tracks are old pieces that exist in the ""public domain,"" meaning that nobody holds the copyrights, so anyone can record them.  If you are a fan of traditional blues, jazz and folk, you will know most of the songs.  The cool thing is, though, that if you don't look at the track list, you will still have to think hard about what some of the songs are while listening to them because Hunter updates and personalizes the pieces so well.  The mood is fun, and the guitar work is as good as anything Hunter has ever recorded.  If you are looking for the more funk-influenced stuff he has done lately on albums like Mistico and Copperopolis, you won't find as much of that here.  This is more like his Duo album with Leon Parker, both in the stripped-down nature and the more straight jazz aesthetic.  Hunter is channeling his Joe Pass/Lenny Breau influences more than his John Scofield influences.  I wish Hunter would record more like this.  His only other unaccompanied album (Solo Eight-String Guitar) isn't exactly a widely available cd.  That puts Public Domain up there with the Leon Parker Duo album as one of my favorite Hunter recordings.

Further listening: Phil DeGruy.  DeGruy plays a 17-string guitar.  No, that's not a typo.  He plays unaccompanied, and frequently records wildly re-imagined old gems, kind of like Hunter does on this album.",positive,negative

1342,"""Take Your Time (Do It Right)"" became SOS Band's biggest hit prior to this album and they wouldn't score another big hit single until 1983, which means that R&B fans have overlooked the marvelous work that was done on the band's 1982 release. This album was not Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis' first produced work (Klymaxx's Girls Will Be Girls album came out several months earlier was their first) because they didn't have a hand in producing any tracks on III, however they did write ""High Hopes"" for the band of which is the duo's first song under their name that was a hit single (#25 R&B hit in early 1983). That song solidified them as cutting their teeth with producing for the band as them being the most in demand producers in the music business within the next 3 decades to come.  All the songs was produced by Sylvers' member, Ricky Sylvers (Leon Sylvers' younger brother) and veteran songwriter, Gene Dozier, explaining why the album sounds a little bit like a Shalamar album, but with major differences with how the instrumental arrangements was made (in which in part were done by Leon Sylvers himself). ""High Hopes,"" ""Good & Plenty,"" ""You Shake Me Up,"" and ""Have It Your Way"" were outstanding examples on why the album should have gotten the recognition it was deprived of. ""Looking For You"" was a bouncy track yet funkier version of ""Take Your Time."" Although this wasn't the best SOS Band album (in my opinion); it was the best before they reached superstardom when black music made a major shift in 1982-83. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis would be the near exclusive producers for SOS Band by the next album, thus changing the sound and standards of black music with the heavy use of the 808 drum machines and synthesizers of which would also make them stars overseas as well.

The 3 minutes is good, but not helpful, I was hoping for lots of pray and scripture references.  If the creature, made it a 30 minute CD with more pray and scripture referances, it would be amazing.  The content of the 3 minutes is good and the backround music, just not helpful, because it is a quick prayer, it doesn't allow you to enter into the prayer and to really meditate on enough scriptures.",negative,positive
1372,"I am a student of Napoleon Hill and have most of his works in print.  I love audio books since I can listen while driving, working out, or right before bed with I-Pod.  This complete work is the unabridged (24 cds!) of his Law of Success volume.  The content is excellent and more thorough than ""Think and Grow Rich"" so allows for deeper understanding and application.

The length of volume and readers limited inflections (I assume he is not trying to color content) makes this monotonous for listening in long stretches.  That said, for 8.99 this is a truly great value and I would highly reccommend!

I would also reccomend Napleon Hill -""In His Own Word"" which is the author in is ""own voice""!",positive,negative
1374,"This is the 1950 Furtwangler/La Scala RING with Flagstad in a new remastering.  The sound is spectacular and we now have a new remastering that truly reveals the genius of Furtwangler in all its myriad orchestral colors.  The sound stage for both singers and orchestra is unprecedented for this 1950 Historic RING.  Never before have we heard such clear orchestra detail in such well balanced clean sound between the singers and pit.  Any other mastering of this RING, including Gebhardt, is left in the so called ""starting gate"" to use a horse race term.  It is truly SPECTACULAR!  It's as if, like AUDITE with their RIAS new radio master tapes of both Furtwangler and now Knappertsbusch live concerts of the 50's ARCHIPEL has been given new first generation excellent radio broadcast tapes; and with many of these broadcasts now being legal to distribute (public domain), that could be the case.  Whatever the case, this new transfer or remastering is a huge audio advance.  I don't need to repeat all the raves about this historic performance; except to say, NOW IT SONICALLY LIVES UP TO ITS REPUTATION.  The sound is now almost like excellent studio MONO of the first tier.  Furtwangler is the true star of this RING. You hear things in the orchestra that no other conductor finds; yet, everything seems so natural and just right.  All the motives are so clear and all the climaxes just overwhelming.  Flagstad is magnificent.  Lorenz is great just at the end of a great career.  HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",positive,negative

Colton Ford's version strips away the lush melody, and synths over whatever emotion might have been in the vocals.  The result is a dead-pan cover with all of the lyrics and none of the soul from the original, which makes me wonder if he ever understood the song in the first place.",negative,positive

All songs are 100% home-made productions.
""...Back then I didn't have decent recording equipment,
so the result became a complete Unplugged Album.""

The motivation of writing songs again came due to the
fact that the relationship with his ex-girlfriend was over.

'Past In The End'. I think that's what made the
sound of the songs quite unique and authentic.

These guys originally formed in Philadelphia in 1974 and then moved to NYC in the late seventies. They played live with the Sex Pistols and Dead Boys. Kurtis Knight, former band-mate and author of Jimmy Hendrix's biography, was their manager. If you are a fan of heavy metal and punk music, this is an album worth owning.",positive,negative
1642,"First - contrary to above information there are images of this album available and there is an album available.
I started work in the music business in 1972, working in the art department of the also legendary Charles Hanson music folios UK office.  My second job was with the American, however, living in the UK, Bob Wise, a remarkable man who revolutionized the world of music folios. And on a more personal note a man who treated me as an equal, and as a woman, someone with intelligence. He was a fine mentor.
So I learned a lot about music and songs putting folios together, and if you google me, you will find my name lised alongside others for various music folios.
Album starts off with Dave's speaking about joining the 1957 The Greyhound Bus Tour (60 days) and he finds himself sitting with Chuck Berry. The opening track is a Chuck Berry Medley.  And Dave does them justice.
As he does with all the other great songs he recorded including Summetime Blues, The Everyly Brothers' medley, Buddy Holly medley, The Drifters, a conversation with Buddy Holly, Fats Domino and other stars also on the bus.
Dave adds dialogue throughout the album and it's interesting to share in the history of a remarkable tour, with so many stars on a bus together.
If you want a history lesson of a time in music when much changed, this is an album you should have in your collection.
And Dave ends his 40 song album with a great version of ""Little Darlin'""  and ""do we have time for one more....""

There is ONE thing that I wasn't happy about. Her record company had it exclusively on another site one week before the official release. I guess that was okay but most of us had to wait until the official day to purchase it. If Jive Records was smart enough to bring the official release a week early instead of having it just an iTunes exclusive thing, I'm pretty that she would have more sales with the song. Not a lot of people use iTunes.  Good marketing technique but not good enough. Either way, I'm just glad to have this song.

However as I listen to it when I write this review, I find myself cringing about the music but sucked into listening to the lyrics.  This is a five star review simply becuase I am a baseball fan and enjoy hearing a good baseball story.  If this song had lyrics about barbies or trucks I would simply hate it.

1790,"I remember this as being the best prtformance of the Fetite Suite.  Gut only 28 minutes on a CD???  I can think of lots of things that would increase the value. The lack of notes is not a problem for me.  Anyone who is going to seek this item out doesn't care about notes.

What would be an absolutely wonderful thing for this label to do is the first performance of Sheherazade by the conductor Issay Dobrowen.  It is 58 minutes of unmatcheable interpretation including a 20 minute second movement which because of its total spontaniety doesn't sound slow at all.  In fact its the best movement of a fabulously natural performance.  What EMI reissued a couple of years ago is the more politically correct 47 minute performance which still is very good indeed.  But, if you want the ultimate by a conductor steeped in this music . . . . . . . ?

And then, there are the Glazounov 2nd, 3rd and 5th symphonies conducted by the vastly underrated Boris Khaikin.  the 2nd and 3rd, for sure, are superior to anything done since. Released in the 70s by EMI records in excellent stereo.

And for more, the first recordings ever of the Prokofiev 2nd and 3rd symphonies with Charles Bruck conducting a razor edged French Orchestra seemingly made to order for this overwhelmingly powerful music which has since been tamed by many conductors but never presented as excitingly as this! A French Columbia recording c1960.

1818,"I have purchased several of the Global Hypnosis MP3 downloads as well as self hypnosis CDs and MP3s by other artists (Steven Gurgevich, Erick Brown, Glen Harrold, etc..).  The Global Hypnosis CDs have a very nice induction period, which is long (excluding the extra ""Relaxer"" track) compared to that of many hypnosis CDs out there.  The voice is very relaxing. Some people might find the ""sound over"" (new age, storms and water flow) to be a little loud on these recordings.  The hypnosis session is really split over 2 tracks and lasts about an hour.  The suggestive script is split onto the 2nd and 3rd tracks.  The only complaint I would have is that there is a relatively long break in the suggestive script at the end of the 2nd track and the beginning of the 3rd track.

This is my favorite of the Global Hypnosis CDs.  I would definitely recommend it.",positive,negative

I enjoy this album because it's not too 'pop' sounding.  The vocals never get too tinny or 'cutesy' sounding.  Instead it's a nice mix of light rock, pop, and punk that has very nice variety.  It's a steal at under $10 for the download.  I put it on the Amazon cloud then loaded it to my computer, iPod Shuffle (for running), and my phone.  I really did the tunes while running or working out.  The quicker tempos make for a nice upbeat workout mix.

I'm not a mind reader or a seer, so I'm thinking those are evaluations made by people who have always had easy access to his recorded music.

So, what does this all mean? Simply that I am absolutely satisfied with this collection of Bruce Cockburn's music. There are many songs in this collection that I've never heard. They are as good as all the music I've become familiar with in years previous. If you're a person who has collected most, if not all, of Mr Cockburn's music, you may be disappointed with this anthology.

1990,"Road Ratt were another unfairly overlooked melodic rock band from the early 1990's. Much like Treat, Damned Nation and Nasty Idols, these guys never achieved any fame outside their native land, but that's not saying they shouldn't have.

Road Ratt's sound is kin to what the Electric Boys were doing at the time. Some people call this funk rock, but there really aren't too many traces of funk on this record in my own opinion. The production is typical Swedish, with over-the-top sounds and choruses, and the songs are just as catchy as ever. How the Swedes continue to pump out such quality hard rock, even till this day, is far beyond me. While I wouldn't call this essential, or even five-star, it does have some really cool melodic rock songs. I liked ""Use The Lighter,"" ""Ragman City,"" ""Beggars Day"" and ""Turn Me On;"" the rest was decent, but there was also some filler that crept in as well.

I think every melodic rock fan should check this record out. Buying the actualy cd is ridiculous due to limited supply they made, but downloading it is like nine dollars. I would definitely go that route fellow rockers, and everyone check this out quick!",positive,negative

2040,"In the heyday of the so-called ""Garage Bands"" one emerged from Lansing, Michigan to make a minor dent on the Billboard Pop Hot 100 in March 1967 with a surprisingly good rendition of the Bo Diddley-penned (in 1956) Who Do You Love? Led by vocalist Stormy Rice, the other members were harpist/keyboardist ""Boogie"" Bob Baldori, guitarist Jeff Baldori, bassist Ron English and drummer Bee Metros, their first time on record was 1965's Black Crow Blues b/w Morning Dew as TTP-156 which quickly went nowhere.

Late in 1966 they got Dunhill/ABC sufficiently interested to release Who Do You Love? b/w Hey Girl as Dunhill/ABC 4052 and by the following March they had made their one minor mark on U.S. Pop single history. However, when the follow-up Duncan And Brady b/w Love Words bombed as Dunhill/ABC 4088 later in 1967 they were dropped. Hits collectors can find a decent copy of their lone charting side in the CD Michigan Nuggets but I have never run across the B-side in any such compilation, so at the moment completist collectors will have to settle for a good vinyl source such the 45-rpm covered here.

Despite their lack of commercial success, the talents displayed by the band were recognized by no less than two R&R legends (and Hall of Fame inductees) Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley and starting in 1967 they often appeared as the back-up band for both artists (in fact, Berry's 1970 album Back Home features their contributions). Sometime in 1968 Rice embarked upon a solo career with his replacement being multiple instrumentalist Zocko Groendahl.

In 1970 they released the album ""Basic Rock"" at Bob Baldori's Spirit Records containing: A1. Who Do You Love?; A2. Two Way Wishin'; A3. Let's Not Use Each Other; A4. Bye Bye Johnny; A5. San Francisco Bay Blues; A6. Hear The Music; B1. You're My Angel; B2. Back For More; B3. Vandegraff's Blues; B4. Truckin'; B5. Wish You Would. From the LP emerged the 1970 singles Vandergraf's Blues (or I Get A Charge Out Of You) b/w Vandergraf's Blahs as Spirit 0007 and Back For More b/w the non-LP side Super Ball - label number not clear. Two years later they compiled their second album, ""Live At Lizard's"" - recorded at Lizard's in East Lansing - containing: A1. Shake The Boogie (3:38); A2. Stormy Monday (4:38); A3. Berry Medley (6:42); A4. Mojo (9:14); B1. Dust My Blues (3:44); B2. I Wanna Boogie (9:10); B3. Hot Tamales (1:46); B4. Comin' Round The Mountain (1:39); B5. Bye Bye Boogie (10:00).

A CD collection of their music recorded from 1965 to 1975 has been produced by Bob Baldori titled Ride, Ride, Ride containing: 1. Super Ball (3.16); 2. Ride Ride Ride (3.06); 3. Black Crow Blues (1.41); 4. Love Words (2.47); 5. Bring It With You When You Come (1.57); 6. Morning Dew (2.45); 7. Chuck's Chunk (2.17); 8. Who Do You Love? (2.02); 9. Feelin' Good (3.01); 10. Can't Get Stuff (3.28); 11. Hootchie Cootchie Man Is Back (2.44); 12. Back for More (2.45); 13. Duncan And Brady (2.24); Vandegraf's Blues (2.54); 15. Two Way Wishin' (2.24); 16. Hyper-Inflation Boogie (1.57). Unfortunately, that does not appear to be available through Amazon.com.",positive,negative

2068,"Of the many shelved Death Row-associated projects, this one represents probably the most regrettable what-if, how-much-of-a-classic-it-would-have-been-had-it-been-released-on-time, situation,

Rap groups tend to behave a bit like radioactive nuclei, i.e., they have a decay half-life. It's quite short and it's especially brief when they are put together sort of randomly and loosely as a promotion vehicle for their members, which was the case with the LBC Crew. This album was recorded around 1995, but it had to wait for Dogg Food to come out first, as Daz and Kurupt had already been introduced on previous Death Row releases and it was their turn to put out an album. But Dogg Food was delayed for legal reasons and only came out in late 1995, just when 2Pac came in and instantly became the massive star around which everything in the label gravitated. Meanwhile there were issues with how exactly the album was to be released. Bottom line, they were given enough time to fall out with each other, and they duly did it, right around the time when the label itself began falling apart too.

And the album never came out, which is real shame.

There are a couple forgettable tracks, but overall this is at least on the same level as Dogg Food, and it should have ranked right there with it and other Death Row releases in the pantheon of G-Funk classics. Unfortunately, at this point in time it's not really possible to appreciate how good the album is as after it got shelved, several of the tracks were reused for other projects and much of the rest leaked on the internet. So few people will be hearing all of it for the first time. And that's also a shame because the tracks that came out on other projects around 1997 ended up lost in the shuffle of the Death Row collapse -- for example, Out The Moon was on the Gridlock'd soundtrack, which went gold, but it nevertheless remains a relatively obscure track because no video was ever made for it and it was never given any serious promotion, Really sad.

Anyway, if you have never heard any of these tracks before, consider yourself lucky and listen to it as a new album from start to finish, you will not be disappointed.",positive,negative
2069,"If you're down with sounds from the DEATH ROW era when Pac, Dre Snoop, Dogg Pound and
others were deeply on the map. You would enjoy this album, cauz this was supposed to

was part of the group as well as lil' C style. For all true West Coast fans. Enjoy.",positive,negative

2090,"Gareth Davis and Rutger Zuydervelt have first met around 2009, when the duo recorded their first piece, Soundlines. After the limited edition EP was self-released by Machinefabriek, the duo didn't waste any time, and put out another 3 CDr, titled Ghost Lanes [which later got picked up by Dekorder with an additional track]. A year later, Davis and Zuydervelt got together again, this time for an album for Home Normal, titled Drape. And now the two appear on Sonic Pieces, with a two-part, Grower. Those familiar with Davis, can instantly imagine the brooding darkness this clarinetist can contribute to Zuydervelt's shuffling treatments. At times barely audible, woodwind breathes over low rumbling drones, creating a stilled atmosphere where even a pin drop gets picked up by the mic. The tender poise of each wave is slowly cultivated through a unique language among the two musicians, allowing the sound to unfold on its own, in environment free of grievance.  Focusing on the music, or just letting it seep, is something a mind must decide on its own. In either case, the meditative piece will reward those with patience. No wonder Grower was featured on Headphone Commute's Best of 2011, Music For Sonic Installations In the Cavern Of Your Skull. Be sure to also check out my review of Gareth Davis & Frances-Marie Uitti Gramercy, out on Miasmah. I'm sure we'll hear from the two again...",positive,negative

2261,"Born in New York City in 1917, orchestra arranger/conductor Robert ""Bob"" Mersey began his long career in the late 1930s with the Big Bands of Abe Lyman and Woody Herman before joining NBC radio after WW II as their staff arranger. Following a stint in Europe in the late 1940s where he scored several film soundtracks, he returned to the U.S. in the 1950s, joining the Gordon Jenkins orchestra as their arranger. He followed that with the same work at Big Top Records, a label launched in 1958 by Johnny Bienstock, where he also released one single under the pseudonym Spencer Ross,  Bobby's Blues/Theme Of A Lonely Evening  (Big Top 3035) in 1960. It did not chart nationally.

He then moved over to Columbia and CBS TV, and their subsidiary Colpix where, mostly under his real name Robert Mersey, he did arranging/conducting for artists like Andy Williams (some 17 of Andy's hits were backed by Mersey), as well as Barbra Streisand, Johnny Mathis, Nina Simone, James Darren, Aretha Franklin, Johnny Nash, Dion (DiMucci), Frankie Avalon and many more. He also found time to release three more singles of his own and one LP as Spencer Ross, with the first being his only claim to national fame in terms of a hit record. That was Tracy's Theme, written by Robert Archer for the female character in the December 7, 1959  CBS TV production The Philadelphia Story, originally a 1940 film and, in 1956, re-made as the musical High Society. Featuring the great saxophone work of Jimmy Abalo, and released as Columbia 4-41532 under the billing Spencer Ross, it peaked at # 13 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in January/February 1960 b/w Thanksgiving Day Parade, from the TV production Miracle On 34th Street. Why it never made any impact on the Adult Contemporary (Easy Listening) charts at the time is a mystery since it was a perfect fit for those listings.

That success led to the 1960 album covered here, titled simply Spencer Ross & His Orchestra (Columbia CL-1525/CS 8325) containing:  La Montana (If She Should Come To You); Carolina Moon; I Go; Dreamy Melody; Theme From ""I Am A Camera"" (Why Do I?); Hop, Skip, Jump; Tracy's Theme; Song For A Summer Night; Solitaire; Play Some Music For Broken Hearts; What's It Like In Paree?; Your Continental Touch. Two of the tracks - Song For A Summer Night/Dreamy Melody then came out as the single Columbia 4-41644, and a bit later in 1960 he had Theme From ""My Three Sons""/Heaven Can Wait r4eleased as Columbia 4-41877. Neither could get him back on the charts, nor did his interpretation of Song Of India which, billed as The Bob Mersey Orchestra, came out as one side of Colpix 152 (the flip, Strangers When We Meet by the Stu Phillips orchestra, didn't chart either).

In 1962 he apparently released an acclaimed - and yet obscure - album on Gallant Records titled Great Jazz From Great TV which, although showing on the label that it was composed, arranged and conducted by Bob Mersey, was credited to yet another pseudonym - ""Det Moore & His Orchestra."" This contains: Jazz Dramatic; Club Cool; Forever Frantic; Call Girl; and Flutesville, among others from shows like Ben Casey, Route 66, The New Breed, Manhunt, My Three Sons, Window On Main Street, Armstrong Circle Theater, Kraft Mystery Theater, and Play Of The Week.

I'm surprised some outfit like Collectables or Collector's Choice hasn't yet remastered both albums for CD format. If they do, one would hope they'd include those non-album sides mentioned as ""bonus"" tracks. If all you want is Tracy's Theme an excellent copy can be found in Eric Records wonderful volume Hard To Find Orchestral Instrumentals.",positive,negative
2271,"Hailing from upstate NY, the Spring Standards wowed a small crowd this summer (2010) at a WXPN-sponsored show in Haddon Lake Park in South Jersey.  Except for an occasional assist by the band's manager on second guitar, the band was a self-contained trio of multi-taskers.  Heather Robb, James Cleave and James Smith sang lead and harmony and simultaneously covered either bass and bass drum, acoustic guitar and high-hat, or piano/organ and snare/tom.  The drum parts were lockstep - you'd have sworn there was a drummer hidden behind a speaker column.  All but track two (due to language) made it to the live show.  So what does the disc sound like?  Pretty much the same as the infectious live show.  Scattershot blues (""Here I Am"").  Cabaret piano (""Queen of the Lot"").  Scrappy Appalachian backbeats (""The Hush"").  Fingerstyle ballads (""Frozen"").  Decemberists-style rock (""Not Again"").  And lots of layered vocals in unusually close harmonies (""Skyline,"" ""Bells and Whistles,"" ""Trouble"").  If you crossed Paul Simon, Lady Antebellum, and the Pretenders, would things be different?  It's likely -- the Spring Standards have set a new one.",positive,negative

As another reviewer noted, it is indeed highly repetitive, but, then, so is a great deal of so-called ""new age"" music (think of Vangelis, for example).

In fact I feel they are such a talented band it's almost a shame they are a Christian band. And by that I mean the simple fact that we all know there are a lot of people who listen to this type of music who are turned off at the mere mention of the words ""Christian rock"", which is a shame, a real shame.

Both their playing abilities and compositional skills are top-notch and I have NO doubt what-so-ever that, if not for the lyrics and label, this band would be playing the mid-level club circuit and have major label backing. Maybe even bigger.

But respect to them for sticking to their beliefs and not selling out and conforming to what the mainstream wants, simply for more exposure.  I can only hope that more people wake up to their talent and they get the recognition they deserve.

2592,"SUPERB is right!  I have rarely, if ever, heard Sonny Stitt sound like this.  Everybody knows about his instrumental prowess, so let's talk about his sound for a moment.  On this particular album, Stitt's sound is so rich, so full, so visceral, it sounds as if he's gonna pop right out of the speakers and play in your living room right next to you.  I have NEVER heard Sonny play with such a full, enveloping tone as he does here. At first, I thought he might have quit smoking or something, but there he is with holding a cigarette on the cover.  But he must have done something to obtain the lavish, sumptuous timbre he plays with on With the New Yorkers.

And speaking of which, the New Yorkers in question (Hank Jones on piano, Wendell Marshall on bass, and Shadow Wilson on drums) support Stitt with aplomb here, never getting in the way, but playing more than we are accustomed to from rhythm sections on Sonny's Roost albums).  Hank Jones plays several fine solos throughout, and comps well behind Stitt's solos.  And what solos they are!  Sonny, in addition to sounding better than usual tonally, is very much inspired throughout this disc.  Maybe he ate his Wheaties the morning of this session.  I mean, he usually sounds good, but he has never, to my knowledge, sounded THIS good. I'm talking in terms of tone, power and timbre. What a transparent, beautiful sound!

When I noticed that there were no reviews for this album, I knew I had to review it!  There are well over one hundred Stitt albums recorded and some of them are bound to get lost in the shuffle.  So I considered it my civic duty to turn people on to this album, so I could tell the  world (assuming that Amazon RR readers represent the world) the this is an astonishing record that you shouldn't miss.  Please note that I am reviewed the Fresh Sounds vinyl reissue here, and the pressing is excellent.  If you only need one Stitt album in your jazz collection, you can't possibly do better than choosing Sonny Stitt and the New Yorkers (uh, doesn't he play with ""New Yorkers"" on all his albums?).

2644,"Yes, the title is a liberal take on Frank Zappa's popular quote about Jazz. But finally there is a rock album worth the title of ""ROCK ALBUM""! In the past 15 years, rock music has degenerated into derivative displays of musical bravado. Instead of allowing the music to stand on its own and focus on creating fun, entertaining, rock & roll music, bands tried too hard to differentiate and experiment needlessly. And when one band or song got ""popular"", hundreds of copycats filtered through the airwaves resulting in the watered down guitar pop that you hear on the radio today.

This album is a non-apologetic, dirty, sexy, joyride! It's what rock USED to be like! No whining, mopey, ""woah-is-me"" crap! No cutesy engineering magic! This album goes back to rock's roots and reminds you what made rock great!

You still get a dose of the Angry Canadian skatergurl, but you also get the feeling that this is more hopeful song.

Its a shame that the true talent does not get exposed and insteand you associate most of his hottest songs with garbage lil Weezy. Like Ms Officer was a KID thang, and Neck of the Woods was a Guille joint.

I remember when a rap style was like a finger print. When you opend your mouth to spit from the first bar you could tell yea thats a Pac verse or you tryin to sound to much like 2Pac or Spice 1. Kinda like when everybody said BG stole his style from Magnolia Slim. Even BG had to mention it in one of his older songs. Point is Nut does not sound like nobody else except the few instances where he sounds like Lil Wayne, but I guess so because he wrote a lot of lil Wayne verses.

I feel that it is wonderfully expressive (some other renditions lack emotion or are too stiff) and perfectly timed (some other renditions play it waaaay too fast and others slow down at times when I feel it is inappropriate), all while never being overly gratuitous with the music (some other renditions really go to town on the solos). I've listened to a few other versions, and this is the one I have stuck with.

2834,"Trae (Tha Truth) has always been one of my favorite rappers to come out of Houston, TX. He has been around a long time, and in my opinion, is way over due for his time to shine. If it hasn't been one thing then it has been another. Always humble, and doing great things for others, Trae is one person who deserves to shine. Earlier this year, 97.9 Tha Box (radio station in Houston) put a ban on Trae's music and even went so far as to fire some of their own personnel for associating with him. They claim that Trae's music glorifies violence and is better left off of the radio. Trae responds with this powerful mixtape, letting it be known that he won't stand for that kind of bs. Support REAL Hip-Hop: Buy this, give it a genuine listen and you will almost be compelled to scream, ""F*** 97.9,"" for what they are doing to Trae. Like I said, this mixtape stirs up emotions that you just don't find in Hip-Hop nowadays. Trae Tha Truth forever.

It's not that these songs aren't singable, it's just that they aren't good musically. I plan on attending -Worship God- this year, and hope to find the live versions/tweaking to be a little less boring.

Maybe I need to digest this album more, but as it stands there is no All I Have is Christ, The Fathers Love, Completely Done, I Will Glory in My Redeemer, or Jesus Thank You on this album.

2849,"I like Renaissance music, and have listened to many works or pieces in this category.  This album says ""The 99 Most Essential Renaissance Masterpiceces"".  I totally disagree.  This compilation has Medieval music (eg. Cantigas, Oswald von Wolkenstein, Landini) and early Baroque (eg. Monteverdi).  More surprisingly, I found many unfamiliar pieces.  I had never heard of these pieces such as Georg Bhm, Melchior Borchgrevinck ...  It is a good chance to know these pieces. However, be careful.  I don't think these are the essential Renaissance masterpieces.  This album lacks early Renaissance music especially early English (eg. Dunstable, Eton choirbook, Tallis), Burgundian school (eg, Dufay) , many important Flemish school compmosers and pieces (too many!), and Iberian composers (Tomas Luis de Victoria, Milan).

I'm glad this version is now widely available as opposed to the lame non-Phil re-recording that shows up in later greatest hits packages.

3107,"The first time I heard ""Ring of Fire"" it was a version by June Carter Cash.  I hated it.  Hated everything about it, from the country twang and plodding beat to the cryptic yet sappy lyrics to Carter's painful-to-listen-to singing voice.  Johnny Cash's interpretation wasn't much better with mariachi band overtones, but at least his voice was easy on the ears (as is the original release by Anita Carter, June's younger sister).

When I first heard Adam Lambert's cover, I had no idea it was even the same song.  Pitched in a minor key with middle eastern overtones, Lambert's musical phraseology breathes new life into the previously incomprehensible lyrics.  In fact, they are so sensual that I took some time to research the song to see if he changed any of them.  While I didn't discover any significant changes by Lambert, it seems there is an urban legend that Cash actually wrote the song but gave Carter credit for it so it wouldn't get tied up in his upcoming divorce from his first wife, and that the phrase ""ring of fire"" is a reference to female genitalia.  (I wonder if Adam knows...?)

My only complaint is that the song is over way too quickly.",positive,negative

Unfortunately, they are not being sold in the U.S.  and I had to import from Germany via an Amazon distributor for  about $10  delivered.

3169,"I've been a fan of Thursday since I bought `Full Collapse' in 2002; I've since acquired all of their albums with my favorites being `Full Collapse' and `City by the Light Divided' and my least favorite being `Common Existence' (which still  wasn't really a bad album, just uneven).  I will say that, after 15 to 20 listens, this is their most accomplished and impressive work to date.  It really didn't hit me initially; the first couple spins didn't form any kind of opinion one way or the other and, while there wasn't anything that seemed `bad' about the music, it was just too dense to soak in right away.  But I highly recommend giving it a chance to grow on you as I guarantee you'll be just as rewarded as I was.  First, I think the production on this is by far their greatest; it's incredibly dense, multi-layered, and strikes the perfect balance of what I believe they were trying to do (and failed, in my opinion) with `Common Existence', in maintaining a dynamic of lo-fi, gritty, noisy texture with extremely technical and varied arrangements and instrumentation.  Next, one of the major surprises I'm sure many fans are going to encounter is that there really isn't much screaming on the album - maybe 30 seconds to a minute combined (and only present on 3 or 4 songs).  However, it would be incorrect to assume this is a `soft' album.  The aggression presented here is more subliminal and abstract then their prior work, which makes complete sense and is a perfect move for a band that is continuously evolving (and which is why they are still musically-relevant today even with being (unfortunately) roped into a genre that has long since died).  Take, for instance, the bridge in `A Darker Forest'; while there isn't any screaming, the music picks up after each verse with a thick riff, pounding snare and synth-bell accents, bringing to mind a passage the Swans might write, which is a fitting example of another band that understands how to create true heaviness with dynamics in more creative and minimal ways than what's usually expected.  And in regards to the drumming, this is clearly the drummer's best work.  In fact, from a musical perspective, this really is everyone's best work and it's more evident the more the CD is digested.  I wouldn't even know how to rate the songs individually as I always listen to the album in full as sequenced, which, I may add, could not be possibly arranged any better.  Overall, Thursday pushed forward again with an album that far exceeded personal expectations, especially after fearing a potential `Common Existence 2'.  It's their best work so far and has potential to go down as one of the best albums of the year, regardless of genre.",positive,negative
3181,"While I wouldn't say these guys are original, that may be the point.  They sound like some of those 80's British New Wave groups; e.g., Haircut 100, the Housemartins and especially late Jam and The Style Council - with a kind of pop-soul sound with horns and very sweet sounding vocals.  Not bad at all.",positive,negative

3190,"Nowadays I rarely hear new Mozart but here is an occurrence: this is my first encounter with K 293, the unfinished Concerto for Oboe in F. Resident in the Fitzwilliam Museum, the autograph consists of 61 measures of its opening movement. The entire ritornello and first two bars of the soloist's entrance are fully instrumented. Thence, the oboe presses on alone for the remaining eleven bars before petering into silence. The instrumentation stipulates Violins, Violas, Bass, 2 Clarinets, 2 Bassoons, 2 Horns. Chronology-wise, here is one instance where K1 was right on the money.  Einstein's attempt to reclassify the fragment as K 416f was discredited by Tyson.

The music itself is a delight. It is less perky and more pastoral than K 314. Robert Levin - the defiler of K 297b - undertook this reconstruction. If one did not know better, one would assume that Mozart had completed the work. The cadenza itself is highly inventive. Bobby, if you're reading, the Australian Knappertsbusch Association has reduced the dollar figure on your Wanted Poster from ten to five bucks and a couple of Mars Bars.

Ingo Goritzki, the soloist, has a beautiful reedy tone. I invariably find Polish ensembles to be musical to their bootstraps: the Polish Chamber Philharmonic is no exception. To fill out the program, the Flute Concerto (K 313) & the Andante for the same instrument (K 315) are transcribed for oboe and successfully so. When added to K 314, this is a generous program, stylishy and vivaciously played. The Claves recording is excellent.

This is a winner.",positive,negative

A cousin who was the lead guitarist of an instrumental band and who played the tune note for note told me that it was by another English band called The Fentones. After getting the 45, I tried hard to learn how to play it but didn't nail the chorus until I can slow it down with my Vox JamVox four decades later! Always been a lousy guitar player, anyway! But I love this tune and always enjoy myself listening to it. I just wish it was recorded in stereo and that would have been great. It was released as a single in my country with ""Lover's Guitar"" on the B side. This tune was in turn covered and released as a single in a much, much better version that the original sounded amateurish. I've always wondered if the songwriter(Elleen Davies)ever heard this version. She would have been delighted as legions of Filipino players made the recording the standard of their guitar playing capabilities. The band that released that recording will forever be recognized as one of the best Filipino rock bands ever, if not the best. They were The Electromaniacs, led by Mr. Ernie Delgado who is widely looked up to as the best Filipino guitar player of his generation.

3465,"This is a great, catchy song, that came from a popular YouTube video.  It's a Miley Cyrus take-off (pre-twerking, but very much post-Disney Miley) that also used video footage from Snoop Dogg (pre-Snoop Lion, I think).  The lyrics are less interesting than some of BLR's other work, but otherwise very much inline with what BLR usually does:  goofy, crass, but catchy.  However, the beat is one of BLR's best and the weird impression of Snoop is pretty great in its own way.

If you're not familiar with Bad Lip Readings (""BLR""), the idea is that the author, who can read lips, used to joke with friends that people looked like they were saying ridiculous things if you were only mediocre at reading lips (or if you were joking around and trying to misread what they were actually saying).

The BLR author took that concept and ran with it, making various political, movie, and music videos where he used actual footage from politicians, movie scenes, and music videos.  For music videos, the BLR author would also make a new musical track and do his own impressions of the artist (or maybe he has friends do the impressions, I don't know).  However, in place of the real words of the song, the BLR author added goofy words that either made little to no sense but were amusing (like this song's lyric ""Tiny Timmy Tokyo"" or the song ""Shoot a Russian Unicorn"") or were otherwise just ridiculous (like the line ""Let's buy two industrial windmills"" from this song, or ""You slapped a fiiiiish"" from a Twilight BLR).  The BLR replacement words are generally very entertaining, and the impressions sound pretty good but still have their own interesting style.

However, a funny thing happened when he was making the goofy music videos:  they turned out to be really good songs on their own.  The beats are impressive, the tunes are fun, and the tracks overall are very catchy.  So while you would probably be fairly confused if you heard this song without knowing what it was, you might still find yourself singing it later.

I highly recommend BLR's songs to others.  They're fun, catchy, and worth a listen.  I can only hope that, like Weird Al's stuff, BLR can work with authors and create more great BLR music videos.  (At least some artists, like Michael Bubl, think what he did with their songs is hiliariousBubl has a YouTube response praising the BLR ""Shoot a Russian Unicorn."")",positive,negative
3469,"Like so many offbeat or experimental bands, each successive release by Gang Gang Dance finds them sporting a progressively accessible sound. ""Eye Contact,"" GGD's fourth proper album, is not only accessible, it's ""pleasant."" Compared to their past work--even immediate predecessor ""Saint Dymphna""--this is practically Easy Listening music for them; spacey synths undulating through leanly arranged melodic numbers, each track flowing perfectly into the next as if it were a Paul Oakenfold mix.

Is this cause for panic amongst the GGD fan base? Hopefully not. While this one certainly is as smooth as a whale's tail, the spacey feel is closer to Cocteau Twins than Enya or Moby. And it's still inimitably, unabashedly, a Gang Gang Dance creation. As with past albums, percussion still takes precedence here, so ""Eye Contact"" is not some dippy trance mix; it has some great rhythms, from the crashing dubstep of ""MindKilla"" to the skittering ""Sacer"" to the thunderous stomp of ""Thru and Thru."" And Lizzie Bougastos is as colorful a vocalist as ever, turning ""Adult Goth"" into a stoner-friendly Bollywood anthem. That may sound silly, but the song's beauty and emotional heft totally transcend any campy trappings such a reference might hold. Such is the power of Gang Gang Dance.

The seamless synthetic approach to the album's production does give ""Eye Contact"" a deceptive feeling of sameness, not to mention of fluffy superficiality. Subsequent listens, however, reveal the character behind each song. Admittedly, I was initially underwhelmed, but now I can't get enough. Similar to Stereolab's ""Dot and Loops,"" an impressive and ambitious album eventually comes out of hiding. Just give it a chance, let it get to know you.",positive,negative

But what really has made it clear to me, is that when the cast does a cover song, it feels like they've taken the magic out of great songs that've been strong for others, and turned them into disgraces. That is the case with Misery, their latest song from Glee. Taking the upbeat delight from Maroon 5, and not really making it their own, hasn't been anything new to my ears. If you really want to be put out of misery, stick with the one from Maroon 5 instead. Adam Levine has a better drive with his music, than Glee does in a single note on the music scale.

3619,"How to understand Malcom X? Go to the source!
Each of these speeches needs to be heard and taken alone with enough time for contemplation. Why? Playing these one after another will only stoke anger. Contemplation of MalcomX's and knowing the timeframe he gave these speeches gives one a sense of hope: When Malcom X gave these early speeches Kennedy hadn't set forth the road that would lead to Johnson's Civil Rights Acts. There was no hope. Water fountains were segregated to white and 'colored'. Bathrooms as well. We don't have them (as much) now but department stores such as Woolworth (think Walgreens and Target) had cafes where no 'colored' people were allowed to sit & have a (Starbucks) coffee with a croissant. These were not gang members wearing bandanas of a certain color and having tattoos on their faces scaring little children ->served today with a smile. These were women who might have worked on the NASA program that launched John Glenn into space & they couldn't order let alone sit and drink a cup of coffee let alone have lunch at these department stores in the south. In the north, where Malcom X was in Harlem, it was more subtle - with rents for apartments and pricing differences. Those were the times. Malcom X was aligned with Elijah Mohammed of the Nation of Islam after serving time in jail. He freely admits he was not a good person. It was the Muslim religion that saved him (in the late 50's). When he got out of prison he became the spokesman for the Harlem unit while Elijah Mohammed was out in Los Angeles. Tensions came between them as Malcom X became the more quoted, more sought after face of the Nation of Islam by the Main stream media & when there was a shooting of a Nation of Islam follower by white police, Malcom X wanted escalation where Elijah Mohammed did nothing & According to the Smithsonian special ""The Lost Tapes - Malcom X"" 2018, this was the first crack in the relationship. In 1963 Elijah Mohammed does not want Malcom X involved with the civil rights movement. Too late. Its already happened. Next came the Kennedy assassination & Elijah Mohammed wanted nothing said. Malcom X was stopped by the press and asked about the shooting & whereas he said nothing about that he did speak to the press which got him a 90 day suspension from giving speeches. He tried to comply but again the press came and tried to confirm the 90 day suspension, Malcom X gave a glib answer and Elijiah Mohammed/Nation of Islam extended the 90 days to which Malcom X decided to leave for his turn at Mecca. While there, he noted that many white people were also Muslim & it changed his thinking so that he came back, split up with Elijah Mohammed, started his own foundation and finally reached out to Martin Luther King Jr. who he had previously pilloried relentlessly for being too soft on his Ghandi like approach. In the end, Nation of Islam had had enough and three of their followers shot him at the beginning of one of his speeches. He was rushed to the hospital where he died. If you want to hear his own thoughts (EARLY in his own development of what it means for the human condition as these were prior to his trip to Mecca and his full conversion to Sunni Muslim belief of inclusion) verbalized then this source is 100% optimal and can't be matched by text.",positive,negative

3662,"Game covers aren't a rarity (just check out OCRemix.org), but high quality, faithful interpretations of game music are few and far between.  So often they go into the realms of badly cheesy and terribly modulated synth, in the expectation that, since it's better than a triangle, two squares and a noise channel, it's ""good"", and since gamers are a goofy bunch, we'll love goofy renditions.

Project X doesn't fall into either of these traps; the challenges posed by the skeletal framework of good instrumental music provided by the Mega Man 2 soundtrack are taken seriously in this album.

One of my favorites, ""Crash Man"", invokes a futuristic funk that was totally not present in the orignal, but is both completely compatible with it, with a crunchiness that helps recall the frustrations of that level in the game.  Even in the most synthy of the tracks, ""Metal Man"", the heavy ""wah"" effect used on the synth melody is carefully orchestrated to match the intonation of the tune.  ""Air Man"", another favorite, is brilliant in its simplicity - it uses synth more or less equivalent to the original, but adds a D&B track that reinvents the whole thing.

I give this a four stars because while I love - LOVE - this album, I recognize that some of that is nostalgia for the game.  There is, however, so much more to it than just being a cover of an awesome game.

Incidentally, this - as well as their earlier cover of Mega Man 3 - used to be available free online.  I was terribly disappointed when I couldn't find my copies and went looking to download, and found that the hosting location had died.  I'm very happy to see that not only is this album available again, but that the band found a way to get rewarded for having recorded it.

3692,"Amy Schumer's act is completely shock value. There is no getting around that. But she delivers it perfectly so it's hilarious. Her timing is perfect. The way she delivers the hidden punch line softly after the louder set up without pause is just perfect.

It's also REALLY dirty. So if you're an easily offended precious snowflake you might want to skip Amy Schumer. If you have no sense of humor you will not enjoy this at all. Her entire act is built around sex jokes, hardships of being a woman jokes, hating other women jokes, religious jokes, and ethnicity jokes. So pretty much every hot button topic that's liable to make easily offended people angry.

As for this album, one of the best things about it is that it doesn't need the video to make it funny. Some stand ups using facial expressions and body language has huge parts of their act, so the audio only version doesn't work as well. Amy Schumer's act works fine in an audio only version. The only exception is the very last joke on the album. She does something the audience can see that they apparently find hysterical, but the joke is completely lost with this audio only version. That's the only instance though.

When she does her bit about how she's Jewish and a Christian tries to tell her about Jesus.......let me just say it's one of the funniest things I've ever heard in a stand up act. I don't want to spoil the punch line but it's in track 7. If you listen to nothing else....check that track out. It happens near the end of the track. Keep listening into track 8 as the bit continues.",positive,negative
3701,"Along with the Mass in b and the Passions, the Christmas Oratorio deserves to be one of Bach's best works. It demonstrates to me how intelligent he was musically in putting a piece (any piece of any genre) together, using particular instruments to add sensitivity and color. And so, 150 minutes go by with not one of boredom. Moreover, hardly any baroque composer can make you weep as Bach does.
I am writing this because, after reading other reviews (some of which, sorry, are so absurd as to deem them inappropriate -- check the one star with the comment!) I have to strongly disagree with the appreciation of the solo singing. For that, I suppose you have to hear other versions; even the old ones fare better there. Specifically, I could barely stand the 'alto' of Michael Chance. He was not in good voice here. The high notes are dry and the lows cannot be controlled very well (I was screaming for a Janet Baker to appear). And: I DO NOT dislike countertenors, mind you. Pity. Maybe we have been spoiled in the last thirty years with outstanding countertenors?
I did not find much outstanding in the other singers, Kooy (the bass) and Crook (the tenor) are solid and Schlick left me cold (this time). Given the year (1989) they were possibly starting their long Bach career and did better afterwards (as my vast Bach cantata collection shows).
The above notwithstanding, the rest is quite wonderful. Conductor, pacing, baroque orchestra, choir. Plus truly outstanding, state-of-the-art sound. For all that, there goes my 4-star count.",positive,negative

3853,"Note that the official orchestra which will play at Will and Kate's wedding will be the London Chamber Orchestra, not the orchestra featured on this recording.

You should get your first clue on the hurried assembly of this album by looking at No. 56 ""The Marriage of RIGARO.""  Um, what?  Also, after downloading, I found that quite a few of the pieces didn't have the composer's name attached.  This really wouldn't have taken long to do.  If you like to keep your classical collection cleaned up by composer, you'll have to fill them in yourself.

I highly doubt Kate would choose ""Amazing Grace,"" [track 4] complete with banjo backup for either her ceremony or reception. Just my opinion.  ""Dies Irae"" by Benjamin Britten [track 7] means ""Day of Wrath.""  Also can't imagine ever hearing this one at a wedding.  Overall, there are some random warhorses of the popular classical repertoire here, which would not make good wedding or reception music.

On to the good points.  The recording features some notable orchestras and ""The Royal Wedding Orchestra"" does a fine job, particularly on ""The Earle of Oxford's March"" and Mendelssohn's iconic ""Wedding March.""  There are some satisfying long tracks like the 1812 Overture (with cannons and church bells!) and the Emperor Waltz.  The full spectrum of musical eras is represented, from William Byrd (Renaissance) up through Vaughan Williams and Britten for the 20th Century.  It's a nice collection if you don't have these standards already, or are seeking alternate versions to possibly improve your collection.

Edited to add:  Tracks 36 and 51 are virtually identical.  Both are solo piano versions of ""Liebestraum"" by Franz Liszt.  More evidence of the sloppy nature of the compilation.

If you're seeking artists that Kate and William will be hearing, I'd suggest you look at the recordings of Claire Jones, who is the official harpist to the Prince of Wales and will be playing at the reception.  The London Chamber Orchestra also has extensive listings on Amazon.

One hears what could be sounds of hoofs hitting the ground at galloping speed, possibly a bird whistling, and this pretty tune.

3924,"The music video is just hilarious, and I haven't laughed so hard for a long time. The senario, the creative outlet. Like the shyness, the "" what's going on"" look?! Like she's lost, confused. In the music video it's like a ""CURSE"". It's like she see's this fortune teller, the fortune teller told her to take a ""SMALL"" bite out of the heart- shaped cookie. The cookie was so ""SWEET"", she made a mistake and took a ""BIGGER"" gulp. She say's ""true"" love would find you. LOL! Apparently, lol. It didn't turn out exactly the way she wanted it to be!!

I guess.. it magnetically drawn guys to her, became magically obsessed with her. lol. Everywhere she goes.. guy's keep stalking her, fighting over her. Fighting to where it's very dangerous, she needs to "" stay away"".

But the daring, Bold Lopez.. is a little mischevious, looking into trouble. Or trying to be ""curious"" of what's going on around her. People getting into car accidents, are WILD!! But, sometimes.. Curiousity ""kills"" the Cat. But.. the funny part is!! She acts like nothing ""happen"", is just dancing with a bunch of guys and Joking around.

I don't really consider that ""flirting"". It's more comical, and a cute Senario, joking around. Then her Papi comes, saves her. All the other guys are sulking, like "" screw this"". She forgets her purse, none of the guys take it. They don't want money!!

She runs off in her MINI Lopez car, is with her Papi. He's in the military. He looks like ED Tempelton. in the video. I was laughing. It was her twin.

But music videos aren't real. It's just for fun. Don't believe everything u hear! One time.. I was watching a music video, this guy had a bunch of hoochies all over him, it turned out he wasn't like that. He was actually not ""kissing"" them. They were all over him but yeah he wasn't a player. He was actually shy, modest. I remember.. jay- Z was flashing his Euro money in the camera. People were like ""yeah"" he's all cocky, greedy an flashing his money around.

It turned out Jay-z isn't cocky, greedy. I heard he's actually real, has a heart.

I suppose they say never judge people by it's cover, unless u really know them. Like the rumors of Jenny, her being a ho. They're not true! It's just gossip.

Don't believe in her music videos as well. Just because she's flirting in the video or whatever it maybe. It's the senario that's trying to match with the song.

Like "" I'm into you"". It's about a women who's into a guy. Not Jenny into that guy! People are so naive, dumb. They think because she's all over a guy in the video she's a ho. It's not true!

4060,"This 2 LP set that ABC/Dunhill issued of one of their biggest artists, THE MAMAS AND THE PAPAS was released in early 1970. It contains most, but not all of their hit singles, plus album cuts. The difference between this and other compilations of the group's music is that this has interviews interspersed between some of the songs. Both John Philips and Cass Elliot were interviewed in 1969, and they give some personal and historic insight about the group in interview snippets. Another difference is that there are some tracks with studio chatter and rehearsal takes, with ONCE WAS A TIME I THOUGHT containing the longest rehearsal of the group practicing the song, and Michelle bursting out laughing because they sang it so fast. I CAN'T WAIT contains some parts of the group trying the song out, while DO YOU WANNA DANCE, DANCING BEAR, and DID YOU EVER WANT TO CRY contain some studio chatter at the beginning or end, or with DANCING BEAR, has John saying at the end that he never really finished the song. All of this is illuminating for the ultra Mamas and Papas fan. But if you may be bothered by hearing some conversation between or at the end of songs, another greatest hits album may be the one for you. This was issued to appeal to the collector, and the original pressing of it as a BOX SET with the booklet is the version to own. The box set version has a beautiful booklet filled with photos, and liner notes entitled "" The Last of the Magic Groups "" by the same writer , Andy Wickham , who did the notes to the group's first album. Lyrics to Mamas & Papas songs are included, but strangely, not every song here has the lyrics, and some not on the set are printed as well. Beware of other printings of this album that do not have the box or the booklet. Both ABC/Dunhill and MCA issued this album into the 70's and 80's in a regular double gatefold with only the lyrics, no booklet. Earlier copies on ABC/Dunhill as a double album gatefold may or may not contain the booklet, even though the cover still had printed "" includes many photos "". The later pressings by MCA just stated "" includes many lyrics "" on the cover. Also, this anthology features songs from just the first 3 Mamas and Papas albums. There is not even one song from the excellent 1968 break-up album "" THE PAPAS & THE MAMAS "" , so hits like TWELVE-THIRTY, DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME and SAFE IN MY GARDEN are missing from this set, making it incomplete for a thorough hits collection.

This album is the last and only time that ABC/Dunhill still had the original studio sessions of The Mamas & The Papas released on an album. Sometime in the early to mid 1970's, ABC Records threw out master tapes from their storage facilities. Unbelievable but that's the sad case. It may have had to do with the lawsuit that the group instituted in 1973 for unpaid royalties, as ABC would sell their catalog albums as direct cut-outs to the budget bins, and not pay their artist's royalties. How very sad that there are no original studio sessions available of any of the group's master tapes for decades now . That is why there aren't any unreleased songs, alternate mixes, different takes, or remixes done on Mamas and Papas reissues, except for 4 songs on the "" 16 OF THEIR GREATEST HITS "" CD issued by MCA in 1986. Somehow, 4 songs survived with either longer fades or a different mix. Some of the studio chatter/rehearsal takes of some of the "" A GATHERING OF FLOWERS "" versions have been issued on CD, such as on the "" CREEQUE ALLEY "" 2 CD set in 1992, and on the UK "" COMPLETE ANTHOLOGY "" 4 CD box set.

In addition to the collector's item appeal of the original box set with booklet, ABC/Dunhill also released a promo only 45 with similar album cover artwork that contains some additional interview snippets with John and Cass.

Side One: STRAIGHT SHOOTER, MONDAY MONDAY, TRIP STUMBLE AND FALL, GO WHERE YOU WANNA GO, I CALL YOUR NAME

4062,"I bought this and the Fedoseyev recordings the same day. This is the more typical performance of the two (not as briskly paced the Fedoseyev), very enjoyable, nicely played, with decent sound. Certainly can't go wrong buying this.",positive,negative
4069,"I think I found this album randomly one time I searched here on Amazon for this band. I had never heard of it, though myself and other Ace Enders fans had both of his previous albums. Still to this day I haven't met one person who knows about this album - and I feel this is a tragedy. Which is why I decided to review it.
This album is a little different than the first two. I would say the first two have somewhat of a pensive/experimental feel, but while this is still existent in Gold Rush it seems that instead of super long track titles and background noise Ace has turned to his ability to make simple, yet irresistibly charming music. Acoustic guitars, simple but exciting drum beats, tambourines (i think), shakers (like maracas. Not the religious sect that came from the Religious Society of Friends), and Ace Enders vocals make up 90% of the surface of every track. Someone could argue this album is more 'pop' than the previous, but I believe that would miss the point because it seems that Ace is actually going against the grain of experimentation that is all over in indie music now and just writes with his heart using the traditional mediums. The lyrics really connect with you in a way that pop never could.
but on past my rant: I'll review the tracks:

Gold Rush - opens up with percussion including the shaker and Ace's amazing vocals, and never looks back. Great track that deserves to be the title track. It will remind you of some of the tracks on The World We Know with it's pensive feel (and especially lyrics) and a chorus that you just can't resist singing along with. (8/10 rating)

Lame Duck - Beautiful mix of vocals, drums, and acoustic/electric guitar riffs (and later on the shakers) that no one else could pull off as well as Ace. This track doesn't have anything in it to make it stand out from the rest of the album which is why I rate it lower (though I love lyrics), but it still has the same charm. (7.5/10)

Connected - Amazing catchy guitar riffs really make this song, that while overall has a slower tempo than most of the album it still seems it would be the best candidate for a single. If I wanted anyone (regardless of their genre tastes) to be curious about this album I would show them this one. Check it out (10/10)

Complications - While this track seems overshadowed by ""Connected"" because it is relatively similar (tempo, instrument makeup) but doesn't have as catchy of guitar riffs, but the more I've listened to it, it has come to speak for itself. Make sure you wait until the last 30 seconds for everyone to come in with their parts - you'll be glad you did. (8/10)

Had To Be There - Don't discount this one because the intro sounds almost identical to ""Complications"" (same drum beat and similar acoustic riffs), however this track is a gem. It has one of the best choruses and bridges on the album. While I'm never sure what the lyrics are talking about sometimes, I love singing with them (whether the lead or background vocals). (9/10)

Don't Leave Me - though this track might not seem as good to someone not used to Ace's unique voice (though he does temper it with some subtle distortion or something), the percussion in this song and the catchy singing of the track title should win you over. Also this track seems the most mature for some reason. Perhaps because each section (verse, chorus, bridge, outro) seem different from each other yet stand on their own as good.(9.5/10)

Misery -  after listening to this album this has become my new favorite. Probably the simplest song on the album, with the verse having only guitars and drums, and the chorus repeats exactly and doesn't seem cluttered at all. Though it is really simple and might not be anyone else's favorite, I just absolutely love the lyrics because of the way he defines Love. Normally i'd probably give it an 8/10, but because I love the lyrics it gets: (10/10)

Gods - This is the one track where the electric guitars really rule over the acoustic. Interesting harmonies that do work but don't sound 'beautiful', rather seem more like just rock music. At first this song was too repetitive for me (and therefore exemplified the only shortcomings of the album) and so I really didn't care for it. Interestingly enough I actually came to really like it myself, which is why it gets an: (8/10)

Train Stop - This song is refreshing if you've listened to the whole album chronologically because its verse drumbeat is different from all the other tracks. There's a great mix of Ace singing quietly and also giving it his all. Electric guitar riffs go throughout the background and make it never boring to listen to. While it finishes the album off well, it seems almost to leave you wanting more on purpose. (8.5/10)

In conclusion this album is what it is and won't make excuses for it's possibly repetitive music and themes. Overall, this album has simple music put to some of the best lyrical writing out there, and deserves a chance from every Ace Enders fan. When compared to the previous I Can Make a Mess... albums, this one earns it's spot as equal to them.

4292,"Originally issued by Buddah in 1969, and reissued in expanded form by the UK Cherry Red label in 2010, this historic collection of bubblegum music is now available for domestic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/digital-download/dp/B004Z0PBLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">digital download</a>&nbsp;through Sony's Legacy imprint. The fourteen tracks of the original LP were pulled together from the biggest hits of Buddah's Kasenetz-Katz production team, including the 1910 Fruitgum Company's ""Simon Says,"" the Ohio Express' ""Yummy Yummy Yummy"" and the Lemon Pipers' ""Green Tambourine."" Brilliant melodic hooks, crisp studio productions and child-like lyrics combined to produce songs that were instantly likeable (except, of course, to self-righteous rock fans who'd long-ago lost track of music's simplest pleasures) and more importantly, memorable. Though aimed at the pre-teen crowd, the songs' surface-level innocence often harbored erotic and psychedelic allusions that were sufficiently camouflaged to escape AM radio's gatekeepers.

Though Buddah didn't corner the bubblegum market (the song of the year for 1969, ""Sugar Sugar,"" was on Don Kirshner's Calendar label, for example), their output is easily the largest concentration of the genre's exemplars. Cherry Red's (and now Legacy's) enhanced reissue drops two tunes by the Kasenetz Katz Super Circus (""We Can Work it Out"" and ""I'm in Love With You""), and adds seven titles, including the 1910 Fruitgum Company's ""Indian Giver"" (which post-dated the compilation's release), Salt Water Taffy's ""Finders Keepers"" and the Shadows of Knight's swampy ""Run Run Billy Porter."" This is both a good place to start a bubblegum collection and a terrific spin for those who are already fans.

As a kid back then, I bought the whole catalog, with ""Flag Wavers"" being my personal favorite.

""Latin Beat"" is a brassy compilation of Prez Prado ""hits"" along with some other ""latin"" standards. The Bay Big Band was more than competent, and the stereo recordings (still a bit early in the stereo era) are nicely engineered/mixed. This is a rich translation of classic latin rhythms.",positive,negative

4514,"Ernest Reyer (1823-1909) is most famous for his operas, in particular the Wagner-inspired Sigurd, which has received a couple of recordings  the later opera Salammbo has been performed since Reyers death, too, but I am not aware of any complete recording. Well, Le Slam, a symphonie orientale in five tableaux for soloists, choir and orchestra, is an earlier work, having been completed in 1850, and there isn't much Wagner on display here. Instead, it is a splendid example of the orientalism popular in France (and elsewhere) at the time; those things wouldnt fly well these days, of course, but I bet there are more people than me who (secretly or not) enjoys the lush, magical atmospheres of many of these orientalist works. The clearest parallel in Reyers case is of course Felicien Davids contemporaneous Le Dsert, which it resembles in style and atmosphere, even though Reyer claimed not to have heard Davids work when he composed his own.

The symphony (or whatever you choose to call it) is in any case a very enjoyable affair, with pilgrims, djinns, sorcerers, shepherds and soldiers getting their turns, and much beautiful, magical scenery paintings. Overall, however, the work is surprisingly restrained  the music is tuneful, but generally gently rocking and slowly building atmosphere; even the orchestration is generally transparent and only rarely veering toward bombast or clutter. I suppose that the material is ultimately not deeply memorable (no Lakm, this), but it is certainly enjoyable and appealing as long as it lasts.

Le Slam comes coupled with expected and, in this context, completely uninteresting excerpts from Bizet (Pecheurs) and Richard Strauss (Salome). Being thoroughly familiar with both operas, I don't think I have ever bothered to even listen to the excerpts here, and I doubt many interested in this release would care either. Reyers work lasts for approximately 50 minutes and the disc is still worth its price, however. As for the performances, I suppose on could imagine somewhat more polished ones. The Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Guido Maria Guida plays well, and the soloists and chorus are generally good, but lacks that last ounce of polish and finesse to always fully transport the listener to the magical realm Reyer is trying to conjure up for us (this is pure escapist music, after all), but I suppose that is also to some extent Reyers own fault. The recorded sound is a bit recessed; it is also a live recording , so you get the occasional cough and shuffle. Still, an enjoyable release, well worth checking out.",positive,negative

I'm reasonably certain of the recording/record match, but it's on a best guesstime based on date of recording matching the record release a few weeks/months later.

All the tracks on this Lp are electrical recordings (post-March, 1925), excepting acoustic ""Wang Wang Blues"" from Whiteman's earliest sessions in late 1920.

Per the liner notes, the musicians in the sessions include Bix Beiderbecke, the Rhythm Boys (Bing Crosby), Frankie Trumbauer, Jimmy Dorsey, Red Nichols, Bunny Berigan, Eddy Lang, and Jack Teagarden.  Mildred Bailey does vocals on ""Rockin' Chair"" and ""Stop the Sun Stop the Moon.""

Lp has great liner notes, two full columns.  This Lp concentrates on Whiteman's later 1920s-early '30s jazzier material; ""Mississippi Mud"" is the most jazzy track on the album.  ""Wang Wang Blues"" ain't bad, from Whiteman's early period.

I bought the Lp to get an example of Whiteman's recordings for Victor, after picking up a copy of a Potato Head Columbia Lp, CL 2820, and being informed by my shellac friend that Whiteman's best known hits were on Victor, not the Columbia cuts.  CD reissues of material this old tends to be legal boots (European expired copyrights) often taken from well-used private collections several (shellac transfer) generations down from the A&R masters, while I'm reasonably certain these two RCA Victor Vintage albums&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paul-Whiteman-Volume-1-LP-Vintage-Series-1968/dp/B00124WUTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paul Whiteman Volume 1 LP Vintage Series 1968</a>&nbsp;are sourced from the original masters at Whiteman's original recording label when he was at the height of his commercial powers.  Sound is remarkably clear and sprightly.  I was surprised, while playing these tracks, that I found them more jazz musically satisfying than Glenn Miller's slow romantic recordings (eh, boring would be the word), even accounting for the relatively staid dance beat and rinky-dinky '20s - early '30s arrangements.

Whiteman's recording periods can be broken down as follows:

Victor 1920 to mid-1925 acoustic recordings.
Victor electrical recordings from mid-1925 (about 78s' series mid-19550 or so)
Columbia ""Potato Head"" releases from mid-1928 to mid-1931 (Bing Crosby and Bix Beiderbecke at their peak)
Victor 1931-36.

Record series for the 1931-36 period break down to the following approximate dates:
Victor 22998 - June, 1932
Victor 24089 - August, 1932
Victor 24365 - September, 1933
Victor 24455 - November, 1933
Victor 25151 - November, 1935",positive,negative
4569,"I bought this album when I was a poor, starving college student because music was always better than food.  Boy, did I feel ripped off.

White Bird-a short, uninspired version of It's A Beautiful Day's greatest hit. It is only 4 minutes long and not that interesting. It is a pointless remake. It was only included so stupid fans like me would buy the album.

Hot Summer Day-another It's A Beautiful Day classic. This is a seven minute version, with a really interesting, spacy instrumental in the middle. It reminds of Pink Floyd's Echos. The singing isn't on par with the original version, but the music is more interesting.

Swept Away is a jazz fusion instrumental similar to what Jean Luc Ponty or Michael Urbaniak would do. It is very nice, but not up there with the best of Ponty.

Easy Woman is a lounge act song. It sounds like something Tom Jones would do or like the theme song to the Love Boat.

This Man is kind of disco a number.

Baby Be Wise is like a combination of Easy Woman and This Man.

Spirit of America sounds like something Kansas would do, with a little Bruce Springsteen and John Wayne thrown in.

This is really not an album worth getting, but if you do, you will get a nice, spacy Hot Summer Day.
Hal Wagnet, from the first It's A Beautiful Day album, plays bass on some of the tracks.
The back up singer is called Dominque DelaCroix. Her real name was Linda. She ended up marrying David LaFlamme, and became the second Linda LaFlamme. She is not to be confused with the first Linda LaFlamme. The first Linda was responsible for writing much of the great music on the first It's a Beautiful Day album. She also sang and played keyboards. She left the group, and David, after the first album.
After the Linda split from David, David was not as successful at writing songs. After the first album, all the best It's A Beautiful Day songs were written by Fred Webb, who replace Linda on keyboards. Patty Santos replaced Linda on vocals, and It's A Beautiful Day recorded four more albums. For some reason, Santos was not on the first album even though she was an original member of the group.  On the last album, Today, David had left the group. Fred Webb and Patty Santos both died later.

It's A Beautiful Day has constantly been fueding with their original manager over the rights to the group's name and music. For this reason, the It's A Beautiful Day albums were taken off the market and have become very rare.  But, you can now get them and also some wonderful live albums.

David and the second Linda stayed together and have been performing since the late seventies. Currently they are performing under the name David and Linda LaFlamme, IABD, formerly known as It's A Beautiful Day. Val Fuentes, the original drummer from It's A Beautiful Day is also in IABD.",negative,positive

My favorite interpreters of Spirituals are by Marion Anderson, Leontyne Price, Shirley Verrett, Florence Quivar and Robert McFerrin, Sr. Inez Matthews is right on their heals.

It was a real pleasure to listen to the recording with one exception. ""Fix Me Jesus"" has a terrible echo and that must be the fault of the engineers who remastered this recording. Otherwise the sound of the voice is excellent. The piano is a bit distant but that's probably the fault of the original recording.

In all, outstanding performances of America's best authentic folk music. Call them what you like, negro spirituals, slave songs or African-American concert spirituals, the music  comes right from the gut and that's how it should be performed.",positive,negative

Peter Allen himself was not a terrific singer, but like many songwriters before him, usually has the listener identify with what he wrote.

4598,"""Monsters From the Id,"" like The Coffin Daggers eponymous debut, takes Neo-Surf to a new level.  Until recently, their albums were only available in MP3, but this one is available again on CD.

Personnel:  Victor Dominicis aka Viktor Venom (guitar, theremin, echoplex); Eudocia Rodzinak (guitar, piano, organ); Peter Klarnet (bass); David Varriale (drums).

One of the best tracks is the cover of ""A Shot in the Dark"" from the Blake Edwards film of the same name.  The Coffin Daggers would be a natural for soundtracks for films like ""Pulp Fiction.""  The songs sometimes start off with a simple riff you've heard before, then take off in a completely different direction.  By the time you're halfway into it, you don't know where it's all going to wind up.  There's a lot of talent here.

If you download MP3s, download legal MP3s.  Illegal downloads can kill a band like this.  The Coffin Daggers have some videos on YouTube--shoestring productions, but they're interesting.

Not so much so with Grouch, though he does delve into this stereotype, he doesn't wallow in it.
There is the dub (The Orb) and maybe a little jazz( Leftfield ). Yet...

4699,"This Vaccines was a big album in the eyes of many a few years ago.  Let's listen to it.

""Wreckin' Bar"" is a nice anthemic punk song.  Well it sure sounds like it's in the punk spirit.  Whether it's technically punk or not I haven't a clue!  It's catchy enough.  ""If You Wanna"" has equally aggressive drumming and a pounding rhythm.  It's really catchy and enjoyable.  ""But if you wanna come back it's alright it's alright, it's alright if you wanna come back!""  That's actually  not the best part- the verse melody is the thing I mostly like about this tune.  ""Well I don't want to wake up in the morning but I've got to face the day, that's what all the friends I do not like as much as you say!""

""A Lack of Understanding"" has an excellent verse melody.  Really familiar too.  The chorus is pretty good ""I've got too much time on my hands, but you don't understand or you won't understand"".  ""Blow It Up"" is fairly forgettable since the vocals get wishy washy, but there's enough melody taking place to make it pretty good.  ""Wetsuit"" opens with hymn-like vocals.  The singer reminds me of the guy from Coldplay here.  The ""ah ah ah"" sounds like the 60's song by Dusty Springfield ""I Only Want to Be With You"".  Pretty decent melody either way.  ""You want to do things differently, you'll do them independently"".  I love the part ""Put a wetsuit on, come on come on, grow you hair out long come on, put a t-shirt on do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong!""

""Norgaard"" is fast-paced memorable anthem rock.  ""Her mind's made up she don't want to go steady she's only seventeen so she's probably not ready!"" is a funny line.  ""Post Break-Up Sex"" is another memorable rocker.  ""Leave it 'til the guilt consumes, I found you in the nearest room, all our friends were unaware, most had just passed out downstairs""  is a good lyric.  This song carries the same rhythm and melody the whole way through but it's a good one.  This band has a lot of talent because not just anyone can write a song like this and make it memorable.  Top notch songwriting puts this song in a higher category than most commercial-sounding bands who write music like this.  ""Post break up sex that helps you forget your ex, what did you expect from post break up sex?""  VERY clever lyrics!

""Under Your Thumb"" is pretty decent pop/rock.  ""I don't mind about taking it slow, I'm perfectly aware of what I'm yet to know, mutually assumed utterly consumed, totally adored, Eleanor!""  A quieter song but still pretty good.  Love the ""Eleanor"" part in particular.  ""All In White"" opens predictably with the chugging bass similar to so many alternative rock bands nowadays, but these guys... well they know how to make it better than most due to strong vocal melody talents.  The melody starts out quiet but picks up the second time around when the guitars comes in.  Really good song, and the lead singer proves he can sing honest melodies.  The way he carries out certain words contains a lot of feeling.

""Wolf Pack"" is perhaps the only song I'm not fond of.  It has a fast-moving pace but it feels like it's missing a strong enough melody to really grab me.  ""Family Friend"" is a relaxing tune with a much better melody.  Really good lyrics too. ""You wanna get young but you're just getting older, and you had a fun summer but it's suddenly colder, if you want a bit of love put your head on my shoulder it's cool""  Also love the line afterwards ""Half baked girl hey I'm hardly surprised, snake eyes disguise everybody's lies, faded nail marks on pale thighs and an awkward secret that someone denies, and now you're trying to get yourself back in, come on in"".

The hidden track, ""Somebody Else's Child"" is a short piano ballad of sorts.  I like how the piano gallops at times.  Touching moment of the album and drastically different from the faster punk/pop rock stuff.  This album deserves credit for the tight songwriting and strong lyrics.  It's a 5-star album alright.",positive,negative

The exception is The Heather On The Hill.  The song itself isn't special; just a straight-up Lerner & Lowe song from the 1947 musical Brigadoon.  What is special is this arrangement, which starts with a pulsing 16 bar intro (8 bars of solo bass, followed by 8 more bars of bass and piano).  Suddenly, the original syrupy love duet becomes a driving jazz instrumental with a pizzicato bass line that keeps an eighth-note pulse running for the full 4:20.  Very danceable.",positive,negative

4810,"The extensive NAXOS series on Sousa marches on with this current entry.  The interesting difference here is a new band.  No longer do we have Keith Brion leading the Royal Artillery Band of the UK.  Instead we have the Royal Norwegian Navy Band.  Why the change?  I suspect it has something to do with the new idiotic policies of the Ministry of Defense (The MoD) in London.  These bureaucrats, who seem intent on destroying what remains of British military music have instituted new rules restricting how their bands can record and perform on oversees tours.  The result is that we are likely to see fewer CDs in the immediate future of British military bands.

That said the Royal Norwegian Navy band certainly does a good enough job here.  The band while less known in the recording circuit performs well despite its slight numbers.  The recording quality of this series has improved steadily over the years.  Earlier on there was a thin, tinny sound to these recordings which has been corrected in recent editions.

The great thing about a series like this which mixes Sousa's marches along with his other music is that you get a complete band concert out of it.  There are enough marches on each CD to satisfy the march connesseur like myself, along with lesser known works by Sousa.  These numerous novelty items, Overtures and selections from his Opperettas show just how talented and varied Sousa was as a composer.  He could really do it all.  As such he stands as perhaps one of America's greatest composers in terms of quality and output.  Sadly much of this music is forgotten today as it was very much of its time.

There are a plethora of CDs out there playing the same 10 or 15 greatest march hits of Sousa over and over again.  The beauty of this series is that it promises to eventually cover all or most of his music, including the lesser known works and marches.  Each CD manages to have several well known marches on it.  Here we have ""From Maine to Oregon""  and the ever popular ""US Field Artillery March""  featuring the famous ""Caisson Song""  which has morphed its way into becoming the generic US Army song.  Funny how the US Army has no desire to have a march for each element, and prefers to just lump it all in with this single tune.  This is one of the things that makes the US Army a bland entity in my humble opinion.  Having a march for each part of the army, i.e.  Infantry, Armour, Artillery, etc.  might create a greater espirit-de-corps but I guess we forgot about that some where along the way.

Anyway, I digress here.  The overture ""Dwellers of the Western World""  is one of Sousa's larger works and deserves mention.  Modern day listeners might find the music for the Red Man and the Black Man to be a bit stereo-typed, but this was how they were seen in Sousa's time.  We should not pass judgement on it.

This is a great series that NAXOS has embarked on over the years and the new band, while perhaps lesser known than its predessor does a fine job under the capable baton of Keith Brion.",positive,negative

5050,"Every Day is a family drama starring Liev Schreiber and Helen Hunt. The film revolves around a family in day to day life and pretty much explores life and everything that comes with it. For the score Jeanine Tesori composes a wonderful small score that has all the right beats but misses being a grand arcing piece. Now you may say that the film is about hitting small moments and such, but any film with a score release that is only 16 minutes clearly isn't letting the score do its job.

What we have here are simple little melodies that while good don't do much in terms of crafting emotional depth. The central motif is quite beautiful and provides a wonderful anchoring point. The score is mostly piano, guitar and strings so the melodies are very strong and hit precisely. What the score does well is craft a warm feeling and then pulls it away so you get a sense of longing. Unfortunately due to the short track times and overall short running time the music doesn't have much of an effect. I absolutely love the last track and it's a great finishing point but it wasn't until that last track that I became completely immersed with the emotions that the music was communicating.

The end result feels like a wonderful vision that wasn't allowed to spread its wings. When films don't let the score flow the way a score should the result is a choppy obstructed emotional arc. It's essentially cutting off the blood flow of the film.",negative,positive

5072,"Originally posted on my blog, Hip Hop Is Read (Nov. 8, 2009):

The fate of the Shaolin Temple was sealed by its leaders' refusal to open its doors to newcomers seeking to join their following. Had it not been for the monks' initial anti-proselytization policy; had they accepted all those who sought entrance, the Temple may never have been destroyed. This important lesson, often recounted by The RZA, is a perfect analogy for the Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture series. Released in 2005, volume one introduced a lineup of indie/underground emcees whose form and style were so compatible with Wu-Tang that it made for one of the year's most thorough (and thoroughly enjoyable) albums. In 2009, a new chamber of cross-breeding music has been opened, this time introducing a whole new genre/style to the Wu-Tang sound: Enter the Dubstep.

Dubstep originated earlier within the decade in the midst of the UK garage scene. A fusion of house, drum and bass, 2-step, and London's grime, with influence from dub reggae, dubstep is characterized by its dark, uptempo beats. While artists like Lady Sovereign and Dizzee Rascal have expounded definitely-British sounds to the United States' audience, the movement hasn't really caught on across the pond... or has it? This year alone, dubstep has made a significant leap into the consciousness of U.S. music fans, whether they knew it or not. Dubstep producers Chase and Status' smash track ""Eastern Jam"" was adopted and remixed by none other than Snoop Dogg on his promotional single ""Snoop Dogg Millionaire"". Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture Volume 2: Enter the Dubstep seeks to further familiarize this new audience.

While volume one of the Indie Culture series brought along a roster of emcees, volume two is production-centric, highlighting the work of over a dozen dubstep producers. To the newfound dubstep listener - I'll admit, I'm one of them - Indie Culture Volume 2's mixes are either hit or miss; thankfully, they're mostly hit. Tracks like Chimpo's remix of the haunting ""Cinema"" by the GZA and his son are eerily intensified by the sinister keys and the dark and sparse soundscapes played throughout. In such instances, the production creates a brand new setting, providing the vocals an alternative meaning to the original; in others, they re-sample original beats, putting an emphasis on dub remixing rather than remaking. The Scuba Scythe remix to ""Street Corners"", for example, retools the great Jean Plum sample from the original, crafting a bubbling, new interpretation that's equally pleasing to the ears.

Unlike the first entry in the Indie Culture series, Enter the Dubstep does not feature any new vocals. The album is a hodgepodge of verses and choruses from previously-released Wu-Tang and Wu-Tang affiliate albums like Raekwon and Icewater's Polluted Water, Lord Jamar's The 5% Album, Wisemen's Wisemen Approaching, GZA's Pro Tools, U-God's Dopium and more (including volume one of the series). While it would have been nice to hear some new lyrics - especially by the main members of the Clan - it works out better this way since this collection is intended to primarily highlight the producers; as such, it's gainful to compare and contrast the originals to the remixes.

It's worth noting that being a fan of Wu-Tang is not an assurance that you'll enjoy this album. Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture Volume 2: Enter the Dubstep is very much like Linkin Park's Reanimation in this regard. Open-mindedness is a pre-requisite, particularly for the untrained ear of the genre being tackled. Nineteen tracks deep, unless you're a dubstep fan you may find yourself pressing the fast-forward button once every few or so tracks. But like Reanimation, the core content is still intact despite the altered sounds and backdrops. Overall you'll find that there's plenty of common ground to be shared and enjoyed when you Enter the Dubstep.",positive,negative

The Californian four-piece, Phlying Saucer, return to the fray with a second 5-track EP of super-melodic pop-punk. Bassist / vocalist / knob twiddler, Evan Brass, has certainly earned his bonus with a razor sharp production which effortlessly leaps out of the speakers, grabbing the listener by the collar, and demanding full, unwavering attention.

EPs work brilliantly for new bands without a full album of songs to release, but equally there's absolutely no room for filler, and it's to the band's credit they understand completely the stipulations of the format. All five songs deliver maximum hooks and thrills, and it's obvious from the moment opening track ""Breaking Down Takes Two"" hits its chorus, we're in the hands of a band making the most of their opportunity.

5320,"This is truly a great selection of songs. I know I'm treading on thin ice here, doubly so because of both the singer and the songs sung on this set of mp3 selections.

I only became aware of Al Jolson back in the late 1970's or early 1980's after seeing ""The Jolson Story"", and it wasn't really the star that impressed me so much as it was his voice and singing style along with the songs sung. People argue that he was one of those who sang in minstrel shows and in black-face which only served to further stereotype and denigrate African-Americans of the times, and to enjoy his music now only further serves to do the same. I can't speak to that. I wasn't there, but I know those were different times, and Jolson was playing to different audiences with different mindsets. My Parents listened to Foster's songs, which was how I grew to enjoy them, but hearing Jolson sing them was truly an enjoyable event. There was never a desire to see Jolson all dressed up in black-face, however. I don't admire the man that much!

As for this selection of mp3 downloads, I am not Jewish, so I can't speak to the few selections chosen that represent his religious upbringing, but, as I said, I have always enjoyed Stephen Collins Foster's songs, ever since I was a child in the late 1950's, when it was still politically correct to listen to them. And to combine the voice of Al Jolson with the tunes of Stephen Foster, even in these times when it may not be politically correct to listen or play such songs, I say is like a match made in heaven.

For those of you who like and admire this singer, these songs would make a great addition to your collection as they are much different that the usual show tunes you hear him sing, and only add to the bulk of his repertoire already existent.",positive,negative
5322,"If you are an Ellington/Strayhorn fan this 1960 album will grab you with some excellent renditions of Take the A Train and Do Nothing Until You Hear from Me that clearly have the Mingus touch.

Mingus had an unabashed admiration for Ellington, which probably culminated as a high point when he and Max Roach collaborated with Ellington on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Money-Jungle/dp/B000SZDMES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Money Jungle</a>. Like that album, Max and Mingus are paired on this one. I must say that as much as I admire Max I prefer Dannie Richmond when paired with Mingus because the way Mingus and Richmond would stretch and compress time, almost telepathically, intrigues me. It also influences my own playing when I am with the right musicians. With Max none of that stuff happens.

The entire album is classic Mingus. Indeed, it was originally released as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pre-Bird/dp/B000VRITJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pre-Bird</a>, but in typical Mingus fashion it was repackaged. And, as if to underscore that, Mingus Fingus No. 2 on the original becomes Chazz Fingers No. 2 here.

Instead of my trying to dissect the tracks, just give them a listen from the sound samples on this page. If you are a Mingus fan, chances are you will like what you hear. If so, instead of immediately pulling the trigger, first check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/5-Classic-Albums/dp/B0071XS3US/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">5 Classic Albums</a>, which is a value-priced set of Mingus albums and where I obtained my copy of this one.",positive,negative

The only offering from Harold Travis I'm aware of..... maybe someone out there can enlighten me if Harold has sung more music. Anyway this is another personal favourite of mine, none of my 90's radio shows felt complete without a selection of cool mid-tempo/slow joints including this great song, an absolutely essential addition to your classic 90's R&B steppers collection....",positive,negative
5336,"I asked my cousin on my Mom's side to help me get some current Soca on my playlist.  He mentioned Machel Montano.  My roots is actually Tobago, Trinidad's sister island.  When I was a little girl, my parents took me to Trinidad & Tobago often to visit, hearing my family members and friends talk is hilarious.  ""Push Bumper"" is a really cool Soca song.  Don't feel guilty if you giggle while listening to it, that is actually the way the T&T accent sounds.  The Tobagonian radio stations in Tobago played it a lot while I was visiting my Dad's house, still under construction in Tobago between June 2011 and early August 2011.  I had fun.
There is a lot of specific organized drums and a tiny organ like sound in the background which riddles the song throughout, making it sweet-sounding.  Machel's voice is robust and demanding.  Enjoy!!!!",negative,positive

5360,"If you like this album, you must make a beeline to ""Going Places"" from 1965. Recent;y I listened to them side by side. Both LPs are very adventurous within an easy-listening paradigm. Both are impeccably arranged. ""Fandango"" holds together better as a whole, perhaps because it was intended for the latin american market, while ""Going Places"" is a bit more ""over the map"" in its selections. ""Going Places"" hit number one on the Billboard charts while ""Fandango"" didn't, but that was not for the lack of critical acclaim. Listen to them both and you'll hear easy listening music at its best!",positive,negative

Seriously, if someone ever asks you to demonstrate the difference between good hip hop and bad hip hop, first have them listen to Bedrock and them show them this.

5443,"This is a review of both Noah Aronson's album ""Left Side of the Page"" and ""Am I Awake"" - I listen to them all in one playlist.

Noah Aronson's music is great for helping out new converts to Reform Judaism, or the interfaith partner of a Reform Jew, or just really anyone who wants to know what a Reform Jewish religious service sounds like (so long as they use the prayerbook I mention below - which so far in my experience, most do).  All with some of the most beautiful voices out there, and really gifted musical arrangements.  I believe that Noah Aronson composed the melodies in this album (not positive on that though).

Several of the songs in Left Side of the Page and most of the songs in his other album, Am I Awake, follow along with one of the main Reform prayerbooks, Mishkan T'filah, which I personally find really beautiful in itself. When I was trying to find sources for Jewish service prayers and songs, almost all the prayers I could find were Orthodox or Consertative and didn't align to the services I was attending.  And many had (sorry to be judgmental, but this is music and it's hard not to notice!) really strident voices, too ""old opera-y"" voices, and/or awful accents in their Hebrew (eg ""Adonoy"" with an emphasis on the oy!).

This was a really nice change of pace - a guitar, a light male voice (tenor?), an easy switch back and forth between Hebrew and English, a light accent (more Israeli than Ashkenazi), pretty duets with pretty-voiced cantors and musicians (including one really cool Nickel Creek sounding guitar arrangement) and nice melodies.  A really nice, respectful, enjoyable listen - and a great way to learn your way through a service.

That said, if you're trying to learn how to chant prayers (some songs can be put to whatever music, while others have to be chanted according to the little squiggles in the Torah - sorry don't know the name of them), you should Google ""Temple Habonim V'ahavta"" and learn for free from Cantor Jodi Blankstein, who has an incredible voice.",positive,negative

The 1943 soundtrack is not the same version as the Nintendo version.  However, I believe this version of the game can be found on Capcom classics for PS2.

5508,"I agree with the other reviewers regarding this set as a whole. I'll just add comments I made on a previous issue of ten of the symphonies on the Quadromania label in the middle of the last decade.

Ernest Bour conducts the SWF Radio Symphony Orchestra in ten Mozart symphonies, 25, 28, 29, 33, 35, 36, and 38-41. The recordings were done between 1964 and 1978, and released on Aurophon LPs. Membran licensed the tapes from Cascade, the owner, in 2004 for this set.

I've listened to four of the symphonies, 25, 29, 35, and 39. The sound is dry and clear. Membran doesn't say when each work was recorded (another issue lists a recording date of January 1978 for 39 and 40), and they all clearly come from different sessions, but there's little difference between them. Bour's interpretations seem very straightforward in the best possible way. He doesn't dawdle in slow movements, he doesn't cover up wind and brass lines but he doesn't emphasize them, nothing sounds rushed.... it's hard to find something strikingly 'right' that Bour does, but that's because everything feels right as it is. I can hear the pitfalls he avoids, for example making the first movement of the Haffner ponderous - Bour's is 'crisp' like Szell, but warmer, less clipped. His 39 reminds me of Szell's as well, although gentler. (Szell was my ""imprint"" version, for what it's worth.) His 25 and 29 are good, and Bour avoids the temptation to be cloying in the latter symphony, but Marriner's early Phillips recordings get more out of these early works and are better recorded and played. Then again, Marriner's Academy Of St. Martins in the Fields is hardly ""big band"" Mozart, so it's not the best comparison to Bour.

Continuing through the set, 40 receives a top-notch performance. 41, which I'm listening to now, is pretty good too, with some wonderfully hushed playing in the second movement. I've listened to 28, 40, 41, and 29 again since my initial comments, and my enthusiasm for this set grows. The sound is slightly boxy, but not to the point its annoying.

Cascade Media had a 40 CD Mozart box available a couple of years ago, which contained the Bour Symphonies from the Quadromania set and this X5 download, as well as the Magic Flute excerpts. I purchased that set for 20 bucks plus shipping, and if you can find it, get it, as it contains the Carmen Piazzini recordings of the piano concertos and piano sonatas, as well as a complete set of the violin concertos. This download is a good alternative if you can't get the Cascade set at a reasonable price.",positive,negative
5509,"This is a very good set of Mozart, and for the price is one of the best deals on Amazon's MP3 site. Germany's SWR (S&uuml;dwestrundfunk, or Southwestern Radio) Orchestra is a quality ensemble and the playing here is all very good to excellent.

It's refreshing that this isn't a ""best of Mozart"" set -- except for some ""Magic Flute"" excerpts, these are all full-length works. And although a number of very familiar pieces are included, such as the Sinfonia Concertante or the Jupiter Symphony, it is not a set of Mozart you've already heard a hundred times.

I did hear an occasion or two where I thought some attacks were a little clumsy -- not intentionally fuzzy as in the Furtw&auml;ngler style, but just a bit muddled. But these were very few and far between and did not mar the set overall. While these are generally not performances that will beat the best out there, they are all highly competent and enjoyable. Very worthwhile as great music well played, and worth a very warm recommendation at the bargain price (right now $4.99, although I paid a little more).",positive,negative

5559,"WireRose - From The End EP (Independent)
Currently causing a stir in their home state of Georgia, where their unsigned status is the source of considerable bewilderment, WireRose continue unfazed with the job in hand - making music. Their latest, the five-track ""From The End EP"" consolidates their ultra-hip modern rock sound, building upon 2009's ""Waiting"" album and securing their status as a band to look out for.

There's a hint of `epic' in what they do, in their lyrics and playing, the resulting sound might best be described as progressive, though we're talking the Radiohead / Mansun school of prog rather than the `70s version, with plenty of post-punk urgency, especially in the guitars, to dispel any thoughts of excess. Their scale is reflected in the length of their songs; the five tracks here spread out over 22 minutes, though there's hardly a second wasted.

Opening track ""Trip Away"" is simultaneously effortless and abrasive, like classic psychedelia strained through a contemporary mesh. The title track dovetails `80s and `90s indie with right now, and again layers some wonderfully exciting guitar playing, the sort of thing that takes you back to the first time we heard Robert Smith or The Edge. ""Monster"" may lack a little of the intensity of other tracks but more than compensates with a chunky, choppy rhythm and the most insistent of choruses. If they're going to get on the radio, that's the one.",positive,negative

Vol. 3 is another good (but not great) compilation mixing album and live tracks from artists including Sarah McLachlan, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Alana Davis, Fastball and Barenaked Ladies. A few tracks are marked collector's edition including Fastball's ""The Way"" (acoustic) and Edwin McCain's ""Solitude."" I'd give Volume Three 3 stars on it's own.",positive,negative

5629,"This was of course a unique situation, with Bernstein conducting Cav of all things. Those who complained that he was out of his element here had better check the score. By dusting off many traditional cobwebs, he brought this to life as if it were a new work he was trying to promote. Domingo had previously been scheduled for this production, but the labor problems which so delayed the '69, '70 season produced various temporary defections, including the young Spaniard's. Corelli took over, and did he take over! At that time, young Domingo could never have approached Corelli in this one, particularly in this form and cooperating fully with Bernstein. There's no doubt who's in charge, but Corelli much more than makes up for his relatively sloppy performance on his commercial set of Cav, where his scooping seriously mars the ""Addio"".

A disclaimer: Yes I am A BW fan; however, I have not been shy about expressing my honest opinion about his various projects.  That said, I love these tracks.  I have always wondered what BW would sound like playing straight-ahead Jazz.  I can still hear elements of the ""Parliament days"" sound.  Those weird ""irks and quirks"" that are BW signatures.  As a matter of fact, I was expecting an all acoustic CD, but was surprised to hear those vintage electronic keyboard sounds.  My favorites are his versions of Take 5, and Watermelon Man. Both stick fairly close to the original melodies, but they are definitely BWs interpretation of the tunes.  I boil things down simply:  Would Herbie Hancock like BW's version of Watermelon Man?  I bet so.  Would Dave Brubeck like ""Take 5?""  I bet.  Antonio Carlos Jobim would appreciate ""Agua de Beber"" ... and so on.  BW's whimsical approach to music reminds me of another one of my heroes: Thelonious Monk.  Both men seem to just hear what they hear, and play what they play.  So I'm thrilled BW is taking a minute to play Jazz.

5745,So I just got back from the Midwest Banjo Camp and heard Mabus play this song during the staff concert.  He had us spellbound.  It was the highlight of the night. It ran close to 8 minutes I think and I would have been happy if he doubled that. What Mabus shows is that a few simple phrases are more powerfull than a wall of notes. Now he certainly played around with the standard melody but he was never unfair to it.  Well done Mabus.,positive,negative

He ASSURED me that the CD version had far better sound and that the tempos are considered by most choral music scholars as definitive. I reluctantly agreed to listen once it arrived. First, I listened to my copy by Shaw and his singers: wonderful sound. Then I played this recording. Well, my teacher was AGAIN correct. The sound was very good, if a bit skewed to the left, and the performance was, well... (I'm not a singer any longer, and I don't have the sheet music), but it was just RIGHT. the listener can just sense the rightness to these pieces. And the BASSES!

5844,"""Wired Life"" marked a strong move into a much more hard edged Techno sound for Meisa Kuroki, who has been previously involved in much more RnB styled music. ""Wired Life"" is at 128 Beats Per Minute and it would make a good late night club groove - the verses of the song have an elegantly brooding mood to it contrasted with a powerful but poised chorus. If you like the music of Goldfrapp, Little Boots, La Roux or perhaps Miss Kittin, then you will like this song from Meisa Kuroki. If you're well versed in Japanese music, this song is probably closer to the music of Perfume, Kotoko or Saori@destiny.
Meisa Kuroki sings with a strong clear adult pop-soprano voice with no vocal affectations. Unlike some of her peers, she doesn't go in for the use of vocoders or other electronic vocal treatments of her voice.

There are four versions of ""Wired Life"" offered here - the standard song, which clocks in at just over four and a half minutes. There's an instrumental version, which shows just how good the electronic music is in this song. A mix with dialogue from the anime and a short anime version.

A further version of ""Wired Life"" appears on Meisa Kuroki's more recent single, ""Woman's Worth"".

Hopefully, a new album by Meisa Kuroki is in the works. I think that 2012 will be a big year for Ms Kuroki, and Nami Tamaki, too, whose new single ""Lady Mind"" could be the ""sister"" single of ""Wired Life"".

2012 - I predict that Meisa Kuroki and Nami Tamaki will be doing some great things in the realms of Japanese electronic/techno-dance music.",positive,negative

6026,"This is laugh-out-loud entrancing and entertaining, as well as a continuation of our enjoyment of Rutter's work in general.

I'd have to review nearly every one of the individual pieces in this collection (each fable being composed of many pieces) to do justice to it.

Suffice to say that we sing snippets from all of them at various times as something comes up which reminds of a situation which relates.

Guzzle guzzle guzzle, munch munch gobble gobble, chomp! for example, when something is tasty.

The Ferrets, the weasels, and the stoats! when we're in the pet shop.

""Alas, I die,"" and ""But it's in the story!"" when we're being dramatic and in no danger whatsoever.

Clip clop, Clip clop, Clip clop, Clip clop, Clip clop, Neigh! when we're laughing at someone running.

And so on.

Totally engaging, dirt cheap, and you can even get all the lyrics if you want to teach your child how to read as he or she sings along.

6266,"I've read several biographies of Rita Hayworth that make a point of the fact that she was never allowed to sing her own songs. Even Robert Osborne on TCM made that point in his intro to one of her movies. The only information I can find on who might have dubbed in the actual singing is from her obituary published in the New York Times, which credited Anita Ellis for the singing in four of her movies (but only listed ""Pal Joey"" and ""The Loves of Carmen""). It's a bit of a disappointment. I love Rita's singing in the movies and the songs in this collection, but how can they pawn this off as a Rita Hayworth collection if it's not her doing the singing?

However, I purchased several of the songs in this collection anyway because I enjoyed Rita's performance in the associated movie. When I listen to them, I see Rita in the relevant scene from the movie.

So the bottom line is: go ahead and enjoy the songs but remember that it is not Rita Hayworth doing the actual singing.",positive,negative

6278,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

The First Ten YearsThe First Ten Years is a series of 10 cds and double 12"" singles by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released between February 24 and April 28, 1990, to commemorate Iron Maiden's first ten years of releasing singles.

Each cd/double 12"" contains two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the b-sides. In addition, each contained a bonus track, a part in the ""Listen With Nicko"" series, in which drummer Nicko McBrain tells about the songs on the discs, in his own humorous way. Each part in the series included a special voucher. Ten vouchers could be exchanged by mail order for a limited edition box in which to store the CDs or records. Although the individual cds and vinyls are nowadays still fairly easy to come by, the boxes are a bit harder to find.

I have varying levels of insomnia (depending on the day and my anxiety level) and struggle to get to sleep as well as stay asleep, to make things worse, medication only seems to work for me for about a week before my body grows accustomed to it and the medication stops working. My therapist introduced me to meditation and, after I commented on how well it worked during our sessions, suggested that I try it before bed to help clear my mind. These work great for this. I especially like the ones with the birds and/or wind sounds, it's so peaceful and not obnoxious like some of the others I've heard with excess sounds. They help me visualize that I'm in a field or something in the middle of nowhere.

Featuring about 45 minutes of nearly forgotten hits of the 20s and 30s, the album misses the familiarity of the band's first release but repents itself with lush sound and soothing vocals; an odd solo in ""Boo Hoo"", however, is a tad off-putting, but doesn't scrape this otherwise grand album!",positive,negative

6486,"From the HOINH MySpace page (no, I didn't write this!)

What a mixed bag after a few listens to this album. HOINH is a large group, the new wave had some really important records in the past months and weeks. Not enough that these monstrous hits. Let's get in most songs, which you surely know.
It is the definition of the new wave of track and eighties-style, ""Hohohoinhho"". A scenario for a man makes her a star and is on her own. And she leaves him? The participation of the dialogue really captures you and the savvy mix of techno keyboards and catchy is legendary. ""This Is A Gun"" is a fairly optimistic number keypad with a touch of ska feeling, but without the horns. The things this group have keyboards, I'll tell ya. ""I Have A Real Feeling"" is a sensitive love song, and has continued in the direction of the new wave of brilliance, but this time R & B master HOINH a rift in the group. The production is a simple mixture of drum machines and light touch of ivory. A classic era of big hair and their second smash ( ""Space And Time Continuhoinh"" is their first). Their next hit here known to the obscure nature, but if you had an eye on MTV and VH1 for about a month or so in 2007, you have to hear this clubby record with a retro feel in ads for shows reality. ""Cyerscheisse"" is very much like ""N For Nerd,"" but the sound is of a Europe that effort updated dance, which is very plausible, but I do not know, it was could be a huge chart hit here.

They need to know and how these four songs, as I was, and am still, but looked at the rest of the series, and asked: ""Total Hoinh"". Well, the truth is revealed that in this sentence HOINH is really not that the industry is a band, but one of its New-Wave Experiment, worked a few times. The rest of the songs are mostly dark-sounding accounts of love. ""A Fluid In The Light"" trip to Motown ""Karma Chameleon"" (even if this does not come, first served). No one asked for, have they? Trippy request comes as a creepy in ""Banned Electro"" and ""ShakeASpear 4 Shakspeare."" These early efforts together with ""Das Falche Gebot"" are just terrible and dated. ""Banned Electro"" is so much talk here that you think it was a great political song, but it is so dry and pop, that it feels stale rocky.

The not big hits are not so bad, but a required taste, you do not expect here. The fun pop hits here, but are very important and very danceable. For the hits, you might want to be this sentence, but the aging of the eighties synth arrangements pull the album. Also, I know it's strange that I want, that imports, but I found it on a trip and had only musically something different from the United Kingdom. Maybe next time I should for something modern.",positive,negative

If I had to listen to them for a long time, I'm sure they'd get monotonous, but Tabata workouts are, by design, short.  The coaching on the coaching tracks is super cheesy, but you only need to listen to that a couple of times before you can take your cues simply from the music.

6729,"Let me say that I Adore Rod Stryker's ""3 Meditations to Live By"" CD (pureyoga version).  They are the backbone of my daily meditation and I use them frequently.  So when I found out that Rod had released this CD of meditations I purchased them straight away, along with Meditations for Inner and Outer Peace.

I have now done all of the meditations on Four Desires.  The Bliss meditation is my favorite in this set. I noticed straight away that 2 of the meditations in this set are ones that Rod has recorded before.  The Healing the Heart meditation on this CD is the same as the ""Empowering the Heart"" meditation that I have on my precious 3 Meditations to Live By CD.  And of course, the Relax into Greatness meditation has been recorded on the CD released previously with the same name.

I found that listening to the meditations with headphones sounded lots better to me than listening to it through my stereo.  Something about running the sound through the speakers seemed to make the little imperfections in sound more noticable.

It's really a great set of meditations.  The only reason I'm giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 is the delivery by Rod.  He just seemed more....caring and into it on 3 Meditations to Live By (as an example).  His delivery on these CDs seems quite a bit more ""business-like"" and matter of fact.  Also, there's no chime at the end of each meditation, so sometimes I'm not sure if the meditation is done or not unless I look at my iPod (transferred the CD).

But a great set overall....recommended.",positive,negative

Then I loaded it on my MP3 player and started playing it when I went walking at dusk every day. Within the next two listens this album had me mesmerized and is now my favorite Zelmani album.

The album consists almost exclusively of ballads...backed up by some of the most beautiful acoustic guitar work you can hope to hear. The songs are mostly about love lost. Ready is the leader of the pack here and has to be one of her best songs ever. It gets ample support from the rest of the material.

The only song that feels slightly out of place is Interior Design, and it would perhaps have been better at the end of the album. The alternative version of To Know You (found on a previous album) is also negligible and not better than the original version.

These are they guys that pretty much created ""Space Rock"" with songs about interplanetary craft, tranversing the universe in 80 days, a scientifically accurate song about neutrinos, and a bona fide space rock opera on side two of the album HOPE. Throw in some nice, though odd, love ballads with decidedly Beatle influences, and you have a unique and rather obscure listening experience.

Really, ""Rarities?"" I was a little skeptical, but after listening to this, I am quite pleased. You can't get more obscure than some of these remixes. I mean, who really cares? Well, I do!

I especially like the reworking of ""Silly Boys,"" and the shortened version of ""Calling Occupants"" works well for me. The live set at the end is rather nice, and they have a wonderful live version of ""Little Neutrino."" Good stuff.

An added bonus is an alternate version of ""Hope"" with a little dialogue by the Lighthouse Keeper that appeared lyrically on the LP HOPE on the lyric sheet, but was not on the album. What a nice ""hidden track"" surprise. I was not so impressed with the MAGENTALANE out takes, but I never really warmed to that album.

If you are a Klaatu fan, this is really fun. If you are not, I would suggest starting with the first album or the retrospective PEAKS. The purely instrumental takes are of interest of those of us who know the songs, but the sans vocal tracks might not make a lot of sense to the uninitiated.",positive,negative
6882,"I freaken love this CD.  If you like fiddles and pipes, you will love this stuff.  If you don't, then you should probably go back to your Miley Cirus collection or something.

I have that Vinyl album that my parents purchased in the late 1950's. So I purchased this CD(Leon Berry at the Hub Rink Wurlitzer- His First and Rarest Recordings!, Vol. 2 ) with out any worries because I loved 'Beast in the Basement'. I love the fidelity of this CD every song is crisp and you can hear every Glockenspiels Traps and all of the Pipes.

6909,"...is a sweeter sound now Ray Thomas' beautiful solo albums are once more available. For too long, From Mighty Oaks has only been available at silly prices and Hopes Wishes & Dreams not at all. Esoteric have done a wonderful job on this set. Disc one is the remastered version of From Mighty Oaks and disc two is Hopes Wishes & Dreams, also remastered. Both discs are packaged in delightfully done replicas of the original vinyl sleeves. Disc 3 is a DVD which plays Mighty Oaks in quadrophonic sound accompanied by camera pans over the artwork for the album sleeve, plus the promo video for High Above My Head. Disc 4 contains a cleverly edited version of the question and answer promo disc from 1975 with Mike Pinder asking the questions, plus the single versions of the songs and for a real bonus, a wonderful NEW song from Ray - The Trouble with Memories. The package is rounded out with postcard reproductions of the artwork for both albums and a booklet containing archive and new photographs, artwork, lyrics and a new interview with Ray. If you're a Moody Blues fan, this is indispensible, even if you have the existing CDs. If only Ray had made more solo albums.....",positive,negative

The self-titled album had some of the most amazing songs I've ever heard by a band. Armistice had its gems too. But this new album seems like they're reverting back to the 70s. I just miss that atmospheric rock sound that MM had that made them one of my favorite bands. After listening to the new album, I can say I am thoroughly disappointed. ""All or Nothing"" and ""In No Time"" are amazing tracks. Other than that, all the songs sound pretty much the same. Crazy drum fills along with 70s style guitar riffs. If you were a fan of their previous albums/sound, be careful. This is nothing like how they were.....and that's a bad thing.",negative,positive

My daughter loved this song, I downloaded it from Amazon onto my phone and she wore my battery down listening to it over and over.  The song is very good and imaginative, constantly switching up styles and beats, we have listened to it very often since I bought it and we haven't gotten tired of it yet.  It is not repetitive, and it does not have any tween/teen themes (thinking about Justin Beiber as one example.)

This beats a lot of the kids music genre that I have heard by a long shot.  I have bought the rest of this album based solely on this song.",positive,negative
7103,"Lisa's crack at the U.S. charts between her ""So Natural"" (not released in North America) and ""Lisa Stansfield"" albums, this ""Beverly Hills 90210"" soundtrack release was pretty smooth, pretty sexy.. It definitely fits with Lisa's signature sound, despite not having been written by her or Ian Devaney. The remixes (by Kenny ""Dope"" Gonzalez and R. Kelly) spice things up as well. Unfortunately, something was still missing and the song did not make much impact on black or pop charts (actually it is hard to pinpoint it as either genre). I like this track but it definitely comes across as weaker than her other material. Then again, weaker for Lisa Stansfield means Grade ""A"" quality compared to other artists out there! Definitely still worth getting for the 6 track promo cd with all the versions!",positive,negative
7108,"It's about time I shared my life-changing experience with three of Michael J. Emery's recordings:

1.  Complete Confidence 2.0
2.  Put Off Procrastination
3.  Sheer Resolve To Do What It Takes

- Did these three recordings alone change everything? No.

- Did they start me, and then keep me, on a path I was previously unlikely to take or stay on without them? Yes!

- Had I tried similar recordings, such as hypnosis and books, to accomplish the same things, and did Emery's recordings prove by far the most effective? Yes!

At the time of this writing, September 17, 2015, I have never met nor communicated with Michael J. Emery. This testimonial comes from the influence of the recordings themselves, listened to over a period of about a year.

The two elements I believe stand these recordings out from others like them are:

1) The music and sound effects that accompany Emery's verbal instructions and imagery. The music is, in my experience, simultaneously relaxing and stimulating. In fact, listening intently, fully conscious, to each of these recordings and their instructions at least twice is an excellent way to learn how to call upon their techniques during a normal workday without the recordings.

2) The most effective image/sound effect for me personally, in any audio recording I've ever listened to, is an ""ice cube"" metaphor on ""Complete Confidence 2.0"" designed to gather, freeze, and put away all thoughts of previous failure, so that I could proceed building confidence without mental hang-ups from the past. My unconscious truly responded to this metaphor.

With these recordings, I was able to build ""Complete Confidence"" in a way I had not been able to sustain before under pressure.

This prompted me to ""Put Off Procrastination"" and act on a number of decisions I had waffled over before, which prompted me within a short time to seek out and then join a public speaking club which I still belong to, and led me soon after to apply for promotion to a leadership position I had not fully seized the first time it had come around, increasing my income significantly.

For those with a ""fear of success"" similar to what I felt for many years before seeking out and listening to these recordings, I won't lie to you - bold decisions lead to responsibilities that can be difficult to stick with once assumed. ""Sheer Resolve To Do What It Takes"" kept me on the path, bolstered me in refusing to give up, and kept me focused on thriving rather than just ""getting through"" challenging situations.

""Complete Confidence"" continued to bolster that indispensable element, and ""Put Off Procrastination"" continued to provide tangible effects that prompted me to act on, and drive steadily to completion (or lead others steadily to completion), important tasks that had lost momentum but still needed to be done.",positive,negative

7437,"This song is very unique, and everyone may not like this type of song...I don't know. I do; especially given that fact that Thousand Foot Krutch made and sings it.

It is about drug addicts, I do believe. The singer is saying that ""every time I hear you say I just need one, to take this pain away/
you're a broken wing, not a broken thing, you can heal in time, if you try, it'll be okay, you can walk away, sweet Juliana..."" and that he wishes he can take the pain away, to make it all seem safe.

In the bridge, he says: ""and I won't laugh, I won't look, I won't listen if you just get up/ and I won't laugh, I won't
look, I won't listen if you just stand..."" and I like that, because that is exactly what people who need to stop something (from a bad habit to drugs or whatever) need to hear, that somebody cares and won't laugh at them trying, won't laugh if they fail again.

Which can be used as either God saying that, or a loved one, either works, I think. Or if the person listening to the song has no one, then it's the singer telling them.

It's really a beautiful song. I recommend it 110%.",positive,negative

7475,"Singer-songwriter Polache got his start with a rousing anthem urging Hondurans to take pride in their nation, Polache is the stage name of 32-year-old Paul Hughes. The moniker combines his first name with the Spanish pronunciation of the initial letter of his last name.

Born to an English father and a Honduran mother, Polache began playing guitar when he was 9. But he didn't think he could make a living as a musician so, after university, he took a job with an ad agency in the northern city of San Pedro Sula, Corts.

There, Polache was chosen to compose the music for an ad campaign promoting Honduras and the result, ""Mira a Honduras"" or ""Look at Honduras,"" became a surprise hit. In the song, Polache points out that besides political corruption, gang wars and poverty, Honduras is home to great natural beauty and honest, hardworking people.

""This is a country with low self-esteem,"" Polache said. ""I wanted to write a song that said: Even if we have thousands of problems, we have many good things that need to be recognized.""

The success of ""Mira a Honduras"" led to a television program in which Polache traveled the backroads, strumming his guitar and singing with the locals -- like an old-fashioned troubadour.

[...]

Polache grew up listening to U.S. and British pop music. But he later came to believe that too many Honduran tastes -- from fast food to popular music -- were imported. ""My music tries to promote all that's catracho,"" he said, using a slang term for Honduran.

For many years he chased that dream playing with one of the nation's biggest teams : Motagua. Failing to obtain success he called it a day and decided to start a career in the advertisement industry. He created numerous jingles for commercial products. His breakthrough as an artist came while working on a Honduran Tourism campaign, which needed a song to go along with the advertisement. Polache submitted ""Mira a Honduras"". The song was selected.  At first his name was not mentioned, but people got interested and started asking questions about the unidentified artist. From then on his career flourished.  Polache went on to have his own tv show ""De Troba con Polache"", in which he visited various places in Honduras.

At some point Polache got financial help from an artist support program created by the couped president Manuel Zelaya. When the coup happened in June 2009, Polache was one of the few Honduran artists to strongly oppose. He called himself apolitical but said he was a friend of president Zelaya.

Polache's music has been a great success thanks to the things he sings about : from everyday social problems to one of Honduras' main passions : football. He tends to write his songs in a very special way, using as much Honduran words and expressions as possible.",positive,negative

It's not the well-known toccata like the Easter-time-favorite from Widor, but this lesser known one is equally fantastic!  In my opinion this one has more drama.

I sampled several different recordings of this toccata on amazon.com.

The others are too slow or lacking energy.

My only critique here is that the echo in this hall makes it hard to appreciate some of the faster passages in the piece.  But the energy is still there, and I recommend this recording!

7504,"The alter-ego of Hevisaurus; Sauruxet is actually the same band, except with a different singer. This band was the result of a contractual disagreement between Hevisaurus and their record company, so the group went off and reformed under a different name and singer. Sauusplaneetta is the only album that Sauruxet ever released. The band apparently worked things out with their record company and returned to their old lineup and name.

The music is fairly similar to Hevisaurus, light-hearted Power Metal and Classic Metal sung in Finnish. The production is excellent and the musicianship (as expected) is also very good. Riffi Raffi has some excellent shredding leads and riffs throughout the cd. The songs actually sound more serious and more standard Metal than the Hevisaurus stuff that I have heard (which is goofier). Then again, I don't speak Finnish so I don't know how silly the lyrics are, they sound more serious than Hevisaurus though, lol!

Anyway, if you are a fan of Hevisaurus or just Scandinavian power metal in general, I highly recommend it! The download is also pretty cheap, though I foresee buying the hardcopy someday. ;-)",positive,negative

7874,"I have had the good fortune to live with the new Scott Matthews album, What the Night Delivers,  for a little while (courtesy of signing up for an early copy as a result of being at the superb Wolverhampton show a couple of weeks ago) Its official release on San Remo Records isn't due until September when it comes out alongside a raft of shows around the UK. It can however be ordered now through his website for those who, understandably, can't wait until then.

Having heard a few of the songs from the album at earlier shows, and hoping they presaged a set of songs that engendered the excitement of the first album, I didn't want to rush into comment for fear of letting my hopes run away with me. But now I know the whole set a good deal better and, without being a retrograde step,  they are a return to the things that first grabbed me about Scott Matthews.

Gone is what was, in hindsight , the slightly over-blown band sound of Elsewhere and here is a determinedly intimate and up-close album, concentrating on the Mr M's vocals and guitar work, an album of rare delicacy and lightness of touch. After hoping for an album like this, what a triumph, what a relief!

Although the band takes more of a back seat, there are none the less some most excellent supporting musicians - Sam Martin on drums and percussion,  Greg Stoddard on lap steel (even more rewarding in a live situation), the fine Danny Keane on cello and Danny Thompson on double bass.

As suggested by the title, What the Night Delivers, is in many respects music made for the dark, the quiet, the solitary long drive on night-time country roads - not an album to get them out and dancing in the aisles, and thank goodness for that.

There are tantalising echoes of the first album Passing Stranger - not just in the atmosphere, but some of the structures, perhaps not quite so overt this time, but still there - the almost-tracks such as at the very start before Myself Again and once more the last minute of Bad Apple leading into So Long, My Moonlight -  musical cameos, perfect in their own way but also creating a little more space and air between songs.

Also in evidence is the Indian influence of before - notably in the beautiful walking Home in the Rain, but fleeting glimpses elsewhere in rhythms and intervals, the tabla on Bad Apple for instance.

To my mind there is not a weak track here, but that doesn't mean that there aren't a few particular stand-out tracks, for me these include Ballerina Lake, Head First into Paradise, Echoes of the Lonely, the aforementioned Walking Home in the Rain.

The album gives off the same vibe that you get from Scott's more intimate and stripped back shows (such as the two Wolverhampton shows at Newhampton Arts  - in 2011  and 2009 ). These are personal and direct, uncluttered by unnecessary effects and additions, and similarly here on this album everything has a place and a purpose. A joy and delight form start to finish, anyone yet to catch him live should make the effort for the dates in the autumn, you cannot fail to be impressed. I hope Mr M doesn't mind but below I have popped my own little vid of The Man Who Had Everything from the Wolverhampton show just recently - apologies for the light level - should he not want it here I will happily remove, but it does give a hint of how the new material comes over live.",positive,negative

7943,"After hearing 2 songs from this guy before this album dropped, I figured it would be a decent album with just raw rapping and not much actually being said.

I was wrong.

The album is entirely produced by Tony Mahoney from the UK, and the beats are all very dark and depressing, none of them being traditional hip-hop type beats, the instrumentation ranges from horns to an upright bass even to an accordion on one track. The album is 12 tracks divided into 3, 4 track parts. To simplify the three parts they could be labelled as Sadness, Anger, and Self-Analysis respectively, while through the whole project he struggles in his fight with alcohol. By the end of the first track you realize that this album is going somewhere serious and you're in for a ride, when you get to the third, The Underground, you start to figure out 24's opinion on hip-hop is very atypical. Not to call it right or wrong, but he doesn't want to make ignorant club bangers an street anthems, but he also not concerned with getting the fans away from it. He expresses the intent to make his music the way he likes it because hip-hop isn't worth saving for an ignorant audience. Track 4 comes in, the melody of the beat is a lady singing in Spanish over the harmony of an acoustic guitar. He keeps the song relevant to the album, furthering his status as a loner while flexing his raw rapping skills more than any other track on the album. Ridiculous bars such as ""Take a shot to the head and listen to Cobain."" and ""Thinking you on C's level but you 20,000 leagues under me."" and a double time spat clean enough to make Tech N9ne nervous. Enter part 2, Anger. Cam feels the need to say ""F*** you"" to a lot of people, starting with fans that won't leave him alone on The Neverending Story of The Parasite, asking them

""Wanna go to my school and get my degree for me? Go to my job and work these 40 hours a week for me? Come up with these ideas and think for me? Have battles every night with these drinks for me? You wanna know how it feels to always be drunk at home? How it feels to live life without a comfort zone? No? Alright cool then stop asking me stupid questions and leave me the f*** alone.""

The next target is the record executives pushing young artists into neglecting their skills and churn out simple mega-hit singles, the last target is the government on The Warden, I felt this song was misplaced, it fits the mood of the album but not the themes so much. I briefly discussed the album with 24/7 himself and he said he felt the same way while writing it, but he explained it as he's so angry with the world at this point in the album that he's getting everything off of his chest all at once before he gets into the final act. One thing in particular I liked about The Industry and The Warden was that in the first verses of each he rapped from the perspective of the record executive pushing the rapper to sign the contract and the government official filling our heads with propaganda and assuring us that they know what's best respectively.

Part three is at least as personal as the first, probably more. My Apologies delivers precisely what it promises, he realizes that he is just as flawed as everyone he has spouted off at. Now that he's alone he's trying to make amends for all the isolation he has placed himself in. Battle Cry has the most positive vibe of any song of the album, almost as if he's sobered up and cheered up, starting to realize where he stands in life.

Track twelve comes in. It started with the sound of empty bottles clanging together, and he almost-mumbles the words ""They say alcohol is man's worst enemy, but the bible says to love your enemy. That's word to Frank Sinatra babyyyyy."" The song is almost like a relapse, he displays a mixture of cockiness, and frustration almost as if he's back to where he was in the first two parts. The piano and upright bass keep playing long after the lyrics end, and that's it.

This is 100% honestly one of the best albums I've ever heard. It's genuine, personal, and poetic. At 22 years old, and this being his 1st album, an incredible potential to do something very big for rap is shown.

""I won't be compared to Eminem, Lil Wayne or Hov. More like Fitzgerald, Hemmingway and Poe.""

So, after about five or six weeks of using the sessions is when I really began to see results.  Particularly when it came to procrastination, that was the area I first began to notice change...typically, I've been very good at putting things off to the last minute; however, I began to catch myself saying no, do it now.  After four and a half months of doing a hypnosis session pretty much every day I see substantial improvements in all areas of my life.  Confidence is high and getting higher, as I said procrastination is becoming a thing of the past, I'm happier and a much better person to be around.

Even though I was into a rather obscure musical blend, they still managed to pull out a track that I was instantly drawn to. Now, I could have walked away from there, but instead bought this CD from them in person for $20.00 - All the tracks on the disc kept me listening.

I guess in conclusion - I have to give them 4.5 stars (-.5 because although I like the music, it's still outside of my normal genre), and for providing me with an awesome disc to listen to.

At the moment (9/6/15), this CD is not available, but the disc with both Beach Boys Songbooks can be had for $466-!400.00. In other words, essentially unavailable. I've noticed that Amazon is beginning to do this with other out of print CD's, usually 60's catalog, and I can only encourage them to do more of this because there is an audience out there for these titles if they're not $100.

The Hollyridge Strings were actually a rather radical idea for their day. Until they put out The Beatles Songbook in June, 1964, teen-pop, the music of Top 40 Radio, was generally considered off-limits for an easy listening instrumental treatment. You didn't here orchestral arrangements of the hits of Fabian, Dion and the Belmonts or the Everly Brothers on the radio or in restaurants and offices. Those songs were kids' songs and the whole genre of rock'n'roll was considered musically worthless. Then came the Beatles and that changed everything. By March, 1965 Time Magazine ran a cover story on the pop/rock scene, by Autumn, 1965 the Beatles would record Yesterday with a string quartet and get airplay on ""Adult"" stations and by 1967 Leonard Bernstein would be praising pop on a network TV special.

But this was in 1964, long before all that, when the idea of orchestral arrangements of Beatles and Beach Boys songs must have seemed like a crazy idea. The project may have been just Capitol Records (who were the Beatles U.S. label) way of further jumping on the Beatlemania Bandwagon as everybody else was trying to do, or it may have been a creative person at Capitol recognizing the melodious sound of the Beatles songs and how it would easily transpose. The work in any case fell to Stu Phillips, a noted composer-arranger whether or not it was his original idea. He was a graduate of the Eastman School of Music who had made easy listening albums for Capitol under his own name, and for Colpix Records produced hit songs Johnny Angel (Shelly Fabares), My Dad (Paul Peterson), Blue Moon (Marcels) and Goodbye Cruel World (James Darren). It was this familiarity with contemporary pop that gave him the ability to orchestrate it without losing its vitality.

The Beach Boys Songbook was the second release by the Hollyridge Strings who, of course, were whatever studio orchestra musicians Capitol had at the time, and it came out in the Fall of 1964. The sound of the orchestra is very transparent (helped by excellent remastering here), with the strings accompanied by horns, trumpets, flutes and extensive use of piano. As you'd expect, songs like Don't Worry Baby and In My Room lend themselves easily to this treatment, and She knows Me Too Well is a particular standout with its elaborate piano part. But the more rocking songs come out intact with all their punch, even Surfin' USA and I Get Around, which boldly leads off the album. This is no sleepy Mantovani strings oversaturating the tunes but an authentically creative reimagining of Brian Wilson's melodies that retains their spirit.

This album got as much play from me as the actual Beach Boys albums in late 1964 (note because Capitol also had the Beach Boys a tune like Wendy which was on the Top 40 when this album was released was able to be included). Stu Phillips went on to compose many movie scores and television themes and is noted for his music for Battlestar Gallactica.",positive,negative

Because he will always be linked to the band that brought him to the spotlight, Moenia, it is fair to compare this production with his fellow former band member Alfonso Pichardo, whose solo release went unnoticed but it was due to being hardly an effort or anything novel.

8462,"Melia - Soundproof Walls (Independent)
A musician for just four years, Melia Kimberly Maccarone has already made serious inroads into a promising career. ""Soundproof Walls"" is her debut long-player, recorded with her band (Dominic Ciaccia - drums, Tim Latus - bass, Rob Cerame - guitar), with Melia responsible for lead guitar, vocals and the songs. That's quite a load for a 20-year old, but she seems completely unfazed, and her all-round performance is incredibly confident, leading her band through a collection of brash pop-punk and upbeat ska-rock.

The production on ""Soundproof"" is gloriously vibrant; the music almost leaps from the speakers. It's absolutely appropriate, as there's nothing lo-fi or half-hearted here. Melia's songs are focused and vivacious, falling somewhere between the navet and pop thrill of early Blondie and No Doubt's Jamaican infused bombast. Surely it can be no coincidence that ""I Wanna Be Your Girl"" brings out Melia's inner Gwen Stefani. It remains a highlight of the seven-track set, though there's no shortage of competition. ""Checking Out"" possesses a great vocal hook and serious guitars; ""Sleaze Parade"" is complex and technical, and thoroughly enjoyable. ""Stay"" indicates a talent for balladry, which might come in handy, should the mainstream come calling.",positive,negative

Sadly, this just does not do it for me!!",negative,positive
8884,"This is a very welcome release.

I never thought of Ninth as a full album. Probably because I only found 7 out of 11 songs actually listenable. The others, however, were his best work ever!

And thats where this release comes in. Of the 6 songs, one is already on Ninth, and a further 2 are unlistenable. However, the remaining 3, plus the 7 on Ninth, that makes for a full, excellent, 5 out of 5 listening experience.

Most artists record more songs for an album than will actually make the final cut. Because half the songs end up not very good. In the case of Ninth it seems, all the songs made it, but across two releases. I can't say that does him any favours, because a lot of people will listen to an album and think 'wtf?' But we can be thankful we have everything now, and make our own 'perfect album' as we see fit.

My biggest gripe with Peter's recent solo work is some bad artistic decisions on the vocals. Until recently, his performances were always flawless. Different... but flawless. He has developed the annoying habit of singing entire songs two or three times, then pasting all the vocal tracks on top of each other, slightly out of time, and very out of tune, with some wild warbles thrown in. Backing vocals should be used sparingly, to emphasize important words or add atmosphere, but if its the entire track, it gets confusing on the ear, and sounds over-produced. 'Secret' and 'Secret Silk Society' suffer extraordinarily badly from this.

When he sings properly though, he has an excellent voice. And its a voice I like to hear. I can't hear how he sings if its diluted by multiple versions of the same thing. However, the song 'Good Works' suffers none of these problems. The voice is clear, solid, passionate, and haunting. The track is so good that I rated the album 4 instead of 3 on this experience alone. It might become my favourite Peter track of all time.

'Secret' isn't vocally pleasing, but its passable, and the song itself is a tremendous feat of writing. Despite the fact it could have been better, I rate it 4.

Then theres the delicious 'Rose Hunter' track. It shines as a perfect companion to the perfect 'I Spit Roses' of Ninth. It has a similar structure, with vocal humming layered underneath a chorus which cuts suddenly with the word 'lovers!' (as opposed to 'spit!) Perfect. Its sung with great passion, and builds throughout.

All in all, 4 out of 5, because it completes 'Ninth' perfectly, and now I feel complete. Peter's work has always inspired me, and I'm so relieved that my confidence in his latest album can remain unscathed.",positive,negative

9345,"Shadowraptr is an indie band from Cincinnati. I had never heard of these guys until recently (more on that later), and I wondered if they were a rap band (given their band name). I couldn't have been more wrong. The band's sound is an intriguing mix of prog rock and funk if you can believe that.

""It's Always Winter On the Moon"" (9 tracks; 43 min.) starts off with the 1 min. instrumental of ""Psychosis in Am Pt. III"", only then to delve into the 6 min. ""Cadavers"", which lays the groundwork for this album, an outstanding, expanding track, led by lead singer/drummer Aaron Collins. The guitar work from Stephen Patota is nice too. Other good tracks include ""Hey Kids! Let's Rap(tr)"", a great funky tune (and again, no rapping). The album concludes with the ambitious 7+ min. ""Psychosis in Am Pt. I and II"".

In all, this is a promising debut album. I saw these guys recently in concert here in Cincinnati, where they played many of the songs of this album, and live it sounded much heavier and funkier than what you hear on here. Can't wait to see them again.",positive,negative

9359,"Singer/saxophonist and band leader Robert Parker, born in New Orleans, Louisiana on October 14, 1930, is probably better known for his prolific session work than his own recordings having worked with giants like Fats Domino, Huey ""Piano"" Smith, Irma Thomas and, of course, Professor Longhair (real name Roy Byrd), including his 1949 regional hit Mardi Gras In New Orleans. In 1960 he cut his first solo single, the instrumental All Nite Long Parts 1 and II for Joe Ruffino's Ron Records (Ron 327), which also did very well on a regional basis.

But his own hits were sparse, with the best being his vocal Barefootin' which surged to # 2 R&B and # 7 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in May/June 1966 for Nola Records, owned by Wardell Quezergue (March 12, 1930 - September 6, 2011) who, known as ""the Creole Beethoven"" in his native Louisiana, also produced his sides for that label. Released as Nola 721, the flip was Let's Go Baby (Where The Action Is), a tune in keeping with the ongoing Go-Go Dancing craze of the day. After the follow-up Happy Feet/The Scratch went nowhere that same year on Nola 726, he managed to edge onto both charts again in January 1967 with the # 48 R&B/# 83 Hot 100 Tip Toe on Nola 729 b/w Soul Kind Of Loving. In the meantime, he had had his one vinyl LP released titled, naturally, ""Barefootin'"" (Nola LP-1001) containing:  A1. Barefootin'; A2. Let's Go, Baby (Where The Action Is); A3. Mr. Pitful; A4. I've Been Loving You Too Long; A5. Soul Kind Of Living; A6. C. C. Rider; B1. The Scratch; B2. Happy Feet; B3. In The Midnight Hour; B4. Directly From My Heart; B5. Heading For A Fall; B6. I Can't Help Myself.

After that it would be tough sledding as none among the following could get him back on the charts: Secret Service (Makes Me Nervous)/Yak Yak Yak (Nola 733) and Holdin' Out/Caught You In A Lie (Nola 738), both in 1967, followed by You Shaken' Things Up/You See Me (Silver Fox 12) in 1969, Get Ta Steppin'/Get Right On Down (Island 015) in 1974 and Give Me The Country Side Of Life/same song (Island 044) in 1975. In that span, of course, he continued with his busy session work. There may well have been other singles of which I am unaware. You should note that Barefootin' had also come out in 1966 on Head 1050 b/w Shootin' The Grease by Jesse Gresham Plus 3, but the Nola release is recognized as the hit version.

The tracks in this volume are: 1. Barefootin' (2:33); 2. Let's Go Baby (Where The Action Is) (2:28); 3. Mr. Pitiful (2:35); 4. I've Been Loving You Too Long (To Stop Now) (2:53); 5.

9371,"R.I.P. Productions (and their alias of Double 99) is the British duo of Tim Liken & Omar Adimora.  R.I.P. were hands down some of the biggest pioneers in the 90's UK Garage scene and by far one of my favorite acts.  With nearly every single they released becoming an underground hit, R.I.P. produced a unique and identifiable feel to every track.  Here are my thoughts and track ratings on R.I.P. Grooves Vol. 1;

1. Move to Jersey  10/10 (Vocal sample with bumpy piano riffs)
2. The Rub (Remix)  9/10 (DnD's ""Diamond Rings"" riff mixed with some female doo-wop vocals)
3. Reach  10/10 (Bumpy Vocal dub UK Garage that's simply amazing!)

Originally released on Ice Cream Records vinyl in 1996, R.I.P. Grooves Vol. 1 is another one of R.I.P. Productions most perfect releases.  With all three tracks representing the best of the 90's underground UK Garage scene.  With the rerelease of these tracks in digital format from the original vinyl (which are now quite expensive) has made me as a long time UK Garage fan very happy.",positive,negative

9381,"all I can say is I second Phyliss's review. its time we all stand up for our liberty. apparently the only ones who have freedom of speech are the ones on the left. dare someone with a conservative point of view criticize the socialist policies of the obama regime and we are branded racists. perhaps one should listen to the hate speech going on at the occupy wherever crowds, and compare that to the respectful, lawful and clean rallies held by the tea party. apparently they are asking the wall street occupying miscreants to leave tonight so they can clean upand disinfect after their filth. the tea party rallies left the washington mall cleaner then when they arrived. and the miscreants on wall street are suppose to care about their environment. what hypocrisy. i think that says it all. by the way it's a great song to, and i have Hank's back as well, as well as all the other freedom lovers in the USA!

9440,"I discovered the Kidney Thieves and Free Dominguez from their work on the sound track for the video game Deus Ex Invisible War. KT was featured in a very limited part of the game, however, just that tidbit was enough to change my perspective on music for ever. Up until that point in my life I'd only listened to classic rock, classic country and a hair bit of anything else. KT opened my eyes to a whole new world of music that I hadn't even known exisited...to date I haven't heard a single track that I can honestly say, ""eh its okay"". Every single song is its own. Thank you KT for making music that kicks A$$ on every level from the words, the depth, melody, everything. I highly recommned that you give these tracks and all other KT work(to include Free Dominguez's solo work) a good thorough listen.",positive,negative
9441,"I've been a fan of kidneythieves for years and have closely followed all of their releases. Many bands as they continue to churn out albums start to lose the creative touch, their edge diminished. Not so with these guys. This follow up EP to last year's Tryptofanatic is equally brilliant. It's far more melodic and ambient than the heavy guitars and industrial metal riffs that they are known for, but that doesn't mean it doesn't rock. And as always, the highlights are the vocal styling of lead singer Free Dominguez and the philosophical core to the lyrics. It's a journey that will make you bob your head as well as provoke deep thought. Music is in a sad state currently with over-produced, over-hyped cookie cutter bands striving for radio-friendliness. kidneythieves notoriously buck that trend and make the music they want to make. That reason alone is enough to elicit your support.",positive,negative
9449,"This album like all the rest of them from the Emerson group is a masterstroke.

Having seen the quartet play in concert and having listened to all of their recordings, it's  sad for me to see David Finkel leaving the group. The album cover shows him halfway out the door.  I've seen David Finkel play in other ensembles at local chamber festivals and he always takes the lead in focussing the energies of the other players. What the Emerson ""trio"" will do with him gone time will tell us. I feel for the cellist who wants to enter that special micro world of the Emerson Quartet. But who knows. No one is irreplaceable  David and his wife Wu Han as heads of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center will continue their world wide search for talent. They are remarkable international advocates for their art.",positive,negative

9461,"X5 has done it again. They have issued a mix of old, re-hashed material from other collections in their ""99"" series and new classical music that is pretty interesting -- at least interesting enough to draw me in at the bargain price as the MP3 Daily Deal on October 14, 2011.

This is almost all excellent music in good to very good performances. If you haven't bought a lot of these collections previously, it is a no-brainer at the special price.

Some number crunching. Based on my own collection -- these numbers may be much smaller or a little larger for you depending on what you've purchased from these sets in the past -- 52 of the 99 tracks here have been released on previous ""99"" sets by X5. A further four tracks are music that has been featured before, but are here in different performances. The remaining 43 tracks are music new to the series.

Among the music that has been featured before are a lot of classical music ""greatest hits"" -- some of the most famous Beethoven piano sonatas, Schubert's Rosamunde string quartet, Brahms' 3rd Symphony, and a good smattering of Mozart, for example.

Within the set of new music, a few things stood out and tipped me over the edge on the decision to buy. Most important was the inclusion of Charles Ives' Violin Sonata No. 2, played by Sweden's Karl-Ove Mannberg and Lena Johnson. X5 is pretty savvy when it comes to capitalizing on what's going on in the classical world, so I imagine they included this because violin superstar Hilary Hahn has just released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/her-own-excellent-album-of-the-Ives-sonatas/dp/B005DWX9YO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">her own excellent album of the Ives sonatas</a>. I was glad to hear the Mannberg/Johnson performance, but I can't say it's my favorite.

Another highlight among the new stuff is the Four Sea Interludes from Peter Grimes by Benjamin Britten, performed under conductor Neeme Jarvi. These are great pieces, although the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/performances-by-Leonard-Bernstein-in-the-last-concert-before-his-death/dp/B000001GEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">performances by Leonard Bernstein in the last concert before his death</a>&nbsp;remain my favorite.

Finally, there are a range of modern tracks by Scandinavian, German and Japanese composers that I found of interest -- pieces by Masakazu Natsuda, Klaus Jckle, Carin Malmlf-Forssling, Pehr Henrik Nordgren, Dag Wirn, Kalevi Aho, Markus Zahnhausen, Erna Tauro, Einojuhani Rautavaara, and Yoshinao Nakada are all well off the beaten path and I was more than happy to pay a couple of bucks to hear this new-to-me music. I can't promise that you'll love all of it -- I didn't either -- but hearing new things is welcome.

Total download size is 938 MB. Bitrates are variable and average 159-240 kbps.

Recommended for anyone at the Daily Deal price. There is a lot of great music here.

9544,"This is my current favorite collection of '70s Nigerian band music. The sound quality is a little rough, maybe less clear than the three NIGERIA '70s albums, but the musicians are good and the total sound is attractive and a little strange, as if it's drifting in on some magic radio from another time and place. A pleasing stew with bits of heavy reverb, oddly tuned horn sections, nice solos and great grooves.

As a thumbnail description: It's a mix of bands. Overall closer to Sunny Ade than Fela. There are also hints of music from other parts of Africa, like Les Bantous de la Capital.

Don't let the slightly lo-fi sound put you off if you like the music in the samples. Go for the musicianship and atmosphere. ymmv.

p.s. ... There's some nice solo trumpet on one track (""Feso jaiye""), and i'm wondering if this is Lester Bowie from the Art Ensemble of Chicago, who said in an interview that he lived in Lagos for a while and met Fela.",positive,negative

9896,"GLMET is a all female Japanese melodic death metal band, I've also seen they like to say they are ""Moe"" (probably spelt wrong) for cute death metal. But they are a pretty awesome band, but are Independent so getting their stuff could be hard but worth while to buy.

This single you get three songs AND a music video for Rebirth! But the music video isn't on a separate disc, its in the regular cd, and if you want to put it on IPhones, tablets etc. you can just open up the CD on your computer and drag and drop the file to desktop. But it wouldn't work for my windows media player, but it works on quicktime.
1) Rebirth
2) Last Words
3) While There's Life

Overall I enjoyed this CD very well, so if you're new to GLMET like I am you'll like this single for a starter point.",positive,negative
9901,"Same as the previous reviewer... This has been my all time favorite folk album since I was a child. I've been looking for this on CD or MP3 for years!  (and When Led Zeppelin re-makes ""Hangman"", you know you shouldn't dismiss it.)  I found a webpage that gives an update on the two women:  http://pennyandjean.net/Welcome.html  Sadly it tells us that Penny had a stroke at only age 19 which ended their singing career together. Thankfully they left us with this wonderful album. Still in my heart.",positive,negative
9907,"In case you're not familiar with Sabicas (1912-90), he was one of the greatest flamenco guitarists of the 20th century and a major influence on all his successors, most notably Paco de Luca.

Confusingly, this 3-volume set is not the same is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elektra/dp/B004AE402G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elektra</a>&nbsp;3-volume set of the same name, from 1958-59.  Instead it appears to be a rag-bag of tracks drawn principally from two albums:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flamenco-Fantasy/dp/B001O0HZDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flamenco Fantasy</a>&nbsp;(1960) and the double-album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sabicas-in-Concert/dp/B0013KSL3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sabicas in Concert</a>&nbsp;(1972)

As to Vol. 2, ""Alambra"" should be ""Alhambra"" (the Moorish palace in Granada).  El Pillallo (or Piyayo, 1864-1940) was a well-known and popular singer/guitarist from Mlaga.  The occurrence of two pieces with the same title but different styles seems to be an oversight on Sabicas's part, as his titles were usually unique.

It's nearly all good stuff, if you don't mind the albums being garbled together.  Since Amazon doesn't list the flamenco styles of the tracks, I do so below:

01. Rondea Llanto Minero
02. Tarantas Llanto Minero
03. Buleras
04. Buleras II
05. Granadinas Patio de Los Leones
06. Rondea Sentimiento
07. Malaguea Homenaje a Mlaga
08. Granadinas Joyas de la Alhambra
09. Malagueas El Pillallo
10. Soleares
11. Alegras Puerto Santa Mara

The total time is 44'22"".

I don't understand why they didn't just reissue the original LPs.  I suppose I must be stupid.",positive,negative

9921,"As a child of the 80's I always have a soft spot for Cyndi Lauper.
But this song just doesn't do it. It doesn't represent her music well, and it doesn't represent Christmas music well. I don't see myself ever listening to the song again unless it comes up randomly in a shuffle.",negative,positive
