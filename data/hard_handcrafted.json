Please find the track you're looking for elsewhere.","661":"Ousttanding Regal Music.","662":"This album is awesome!  If you love Freedom and America, yuo have to pick up this album!  The title track, \"American Rifle\" is one of the best written songs that I know and it truly expresses how many of us in this country feel about freedom and the price of freedom that has been paid throughout history.","663":"Superb performances terribly reproduced by the worst of the early 1980's digital CDs' I have ever heard.","664":"A classic!","665":"If you want gerat Latin music, Cugat is the one.","666":"Always looking for some good but beautiful music for the Fall sesaon.

I was so mad that I didn't even open it up to listen to it(still factory sealed).I just put it off to the side and now it's probably to late to return it for something else.","672":"I was a bit disappoinetd with this track.

Seems we live in a society where bored housewives are so desperate for attention and fame, they will humiliate themselves to no end just to get attention.

Super fun, happy music that gets both children and adults moving to the beat.","685":"dauhgter loved it","686":"The Spider Hole is one of those bands that defy categorization, as only the best do.  If nothing else, its eccentric rock the sort of rock with impeccable style, that wears a fedora, bursts unexpectedly through the haze of a smoky club and sways its hips with a swinging, boozy groove, sometimes foul-mouthed but always charming.  It both compliments and intrudes upon your melancholy thoughts with gratifying irreverence.\n\nThe lyrics can be absurd and surreal--but even at theri extremes, they are too poetic to be entirely gratuitous.  They are dream-like, driving in pace along with the music, and you could just enjoy the sound of them and the clever turns of phrase, if you like.  But if you really listen you might get the sense that youve fallen down a rabbit hole of some punkish film noir series, with mysterious characters and strange story-telling.  The lead singers voice is both wild and precise, with such a daring stylistic range that you nearly imagine it to be more than one person.\n\nFor a debut album this is an incredible offering -- every song is solid and the album is tight in production and coherent in tone.  Excellent guitar, bass, drums along with whimsical piano riffs, the occasional horn, and various effects that all add to the mood at just the right times.  It would be impossible to pick one favorite or standout among so many strong tracks.  Not a single weak song to be skipped.  In fact, its still, many years after its initial release, one of my all-time favorite albums to play all the way through.  Its darkly theatrical and a lot of fun to move to.\n\nTo sum up... Holy sh** this band is awesome!  Buy this album and you will have a hidden gem of musical mischief with which to while away the dull hours and impress your friends with!  The Spider Hole stands alone -- there is no other band quite like them.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n(Its also worth the effort to track down the band and give them some love and cash to snag a copy of their newest album Royal Spend, which is just as great but unavailable on Amazon as of this writing.)","687":"It has a great  upbeat tempo. I love his voice because it's soothing and not screeching. Th efirst time I heard it I knew I had to have it.","688":"I searched some years for this song. I checked every place on the Internet I could think of. And guess where I finally fuond it .... it Amazon. Incredible!

I don't caref or live versions, there is always to much talking","693":"Al Harris's song \"The Ballad of Kate Shelley\" is passable as far as old backwoods folk songs go. Harris's singing is very monotone and the sonwgriting sounds more like he's reciting the text of the story as opposed to singing about a legend, aka. Woody Guthrie's rendition of \"John Henry\"\nScott and Michelle Dalziel's interpretation of the Kate Shelley legend is far superior and more enjoyable to listen to.","694":"Casey's release after his run on American Idol was so amazing that it remains one of my favorite albums when I want an uplfiting fun listen. This one, by comparison is nothing but depressing. I wouldn't even know it was the same guy. Buyer beware.","695":"Jeremy McComb is a fine young singer songwriter, and this is a good follow up to his fabulous first effort My Side of Town! My ONYL quibble is that one of my favorite songs, 5 to Midnight, has a hidden gem - but there is an *11* minute gap to that bonus track.  LOVE She Doesn't Sing!  Nice job, Jeremy!","696":"What a wonderful song.....great lyrics, tune and it has such a soothing melody.

While I have about 50 Mantovani LP albums, most from my parent's collection and some purchased used, most do not have dates printed on them anywhere.  The current best source of album listings that I have found is at[...].  Wikipedia's Mantovani page lists 2 additional Christmas albums: Christmas Carols, London LL 913; and Merry Christmas to All of You, Decca 66445009 (1963).  I cannot find any other references to either of these albums anywhere.  There is an extensive LP (and even old 78s) listing on the mantovani-orchestra(dot)com site, but it does not include many US albums that I own and it appears that the catalog numbers there are non-US.\n================================================================","704":"Awesome ablum!","705":"Freakin' awesome!

God bless you Morris!","711":"oN","712":"A rgeat song.","713":"My man Dom Pachino is maad nice, and son's skills have only increased since Killarmy's first joint 'Silent Weapons'. (If you hear Dom on 'Silent Weapons' and listen to him on later albums and projects, you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.) I've also been really impressed by Pachino's newer solo joints (go and copp that 'Unreleased' joint) on his Napalm Recordings imprint, which is nice because now fans get to hear Pachino spit 100% rather than passing the mic to his compadres. Hands down, Dom Pachino is one of my favorite emcees, PERIOD.\n\nHowever, I heard this and was heavily disappointed and let down. If you listen to all of his solo projects since the last Killarmy album, PR sounds like he's pumped full of vigorous energy, spittin venomous darts all around the tracks. This one '4 Security Reasons' sounds lazy, tired, boring, lethargic, monotonous, uninspired, and overall a below average performance from the PRT.\n\nWhoever was enlisted for production provided some really tired samples that were sloppily chopped up. On top of that, the beats are all under about 120 bpm except for a fast song (track 3, \"Gunz Out\")with some sloppy drum programming. Even Dom's darts are terribly boring as are those from the lesser known Wu-affiliates (like Crunch Lo from Cappadonn'a group Othorized F.A.M.), which is one reason why so much of the extended Wu fam is unknown: most of them aren't worth listening to. I hope this 'Security' project is not a downward spiral into the descent of wackness for Dom. Only time will tell.\n\nBut if you want some hot Dom ish, check out 'Unreleased', 'Domination' (which is really hard to find), or almost anything unedr his Napalm recording label.","714":"I don't remember this song, so it probbaly sucks.","715":"Couldn't see the isntrumental on the title.

Once you download it, you bought it. I have notified Amazon and hopefully they will fix this soon.","719":"I was very disappointed to receive only 2.37 minutes of this lovely anthem. I feel cheated.

I will be trying other sites now for purchases of my music now on. tell you change it back.","730":"for the time it was written and how long it is, it's slow, I just can't seemt o get into it,","731":"I am a fan of subliminal programs although not of brainwave binaural beat programs, and I bought this one to motivate me to try a French language course. However, I must say I am tired of subliminal CD's and MP3's that do not let the buyer know what messages they will be receiving in their music, nature sound, or \"silent\" programs. Silent? Does that mean homeopathic subliminal, ie-nothing in it?\nA list of the suggestions would be especially nice on the subliminals that cannot be heard over music, nature sounds, etc.. This is one of those programs-ocean sounds to learn french. But it does not say crave french language studies,  learn\/adapt to French more easily, or actually learn the language, ok, clearly the last one-not. Should one listen during studies,at night, before study, after study, what is the purpose? Also, if this is a brainwave or binaural it should be labled as such.\nNow here is the truth, the most one can hope for in subliminal language learning programs is to heighten the desire to learn the language, take a class in the language, or heighten the ability of the listener to learn or develop linguistic skills when they are in classes, working the speech lab, or using a language course\/album. This album lacks a description of which type of message you are getting.\nAlthough this is a pleasant sounding program, ncie ocean sounds, etc., I prefer the types of programs where one can audibly hear the suggestions even if only as a whisper in the background. Also, whether I can hear the message audibly or not, I cannot see why the makers of these programs are unwilling to provide a description on the site of the messages used in the programs. Some of the programs I purchased for weight loss were nicely effective after a couple of weeks. They had audible messages in the programs and lots of reviews.\nI have not yet gone 2 weeks with this program, but a similar program I purchased for another issue with ocean waves and no audible message has not been effective. My husband said at this price just try it. I gave it two stars for having really soothing sounds. If if works I will update the review. I will try it but it is time to get message descriptions on these subliminal MP3's &CD's. If you listen to the previews, some of them are great, some are not informative of content other than a title, some include binaural programs but don't say that on the covers\/titles, some are simple meditation programs, some appear to be scientology subliminals,& others are downright weird. Please start giving clear content\/message descriptions so buyers can be sure of what they are buying!","732":"Buyer beware. This is a botoleg. This is not an official Apple or Beatles release. Proceed with caution & be sure to research before you purchase.","733":" Idon't even understand how there are only 2 other reviews of this album on amazon. These guys make some really amazing music, they deserve far more recognition than this! A couple of the songs on this cd are among my very favorite songs of all time!","734":"Enjoying this cd purchsaed, and surprised of the low price. This is far the best LoneStar cd vocally that i have purchased.  Great Cd but wish there were more songs to hear.","735":"onew orthwhile tune","736":"very disappointed in tis dc. I would not recommend it to friends and would not give it as a gift. No good","737":"I saw them at Atlanta Fest this past summer (held yearly at Stone Mountain Park) and, while they were in one of the \"side\" tents, I DEFINITELY feel they deserve to be on the main stage and hope they are next year.\n\nIn fact I feel they are such a talented band it's almost a shame they are a Christian band. And by that I mean the simple fact that we all know there are a lot of peopl ewho listen to this type of music who are turned off at the mere mention of the words \"Christian rock\", which is a shame, a real shame.\n\nBoth their playing abilities and compositional skills are top-notch and I have NO doubt what-so-ever that, if not for the lyrics and label, this band would be playing the mid-level club circuit and have major label backing. Maybe even bigger.\n\nBut respect to them for sticking to their beliefs and not selling out and conforming to what the mainstream wants, simply for more exposure.  I can only hope that more people wake up to their talent and they get the recognition they deserve.\n\nMe, I'll be waiting for their full-length debut and their next concert in my area!","738":"I bought this CD as a gift, so I have not listened to it yet.  My goal was to get Beethoven performed by the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra, and this is IT!  The surprise was that it is from China, and all the descriptions on the cover are in Chinese!  Since it's Beethoven, I'm not too wroried about that, but it might have been nice to read whatever is printed on the jacket!","739":"Very unprofessional, amateurish. She sounds like a BAD actress reading BADLY from a bad script. There is no calm flow here as with most hypnosis recordings or guided meditations. I've heard better reading from grade school kids.\nShe can't even keep the flow of words going from the end of a line on the page into the one below it, automatically making it sound as if the next line on the page is an entirely new sentence instead of a continuation of the previous one. VERY robotic and rushed.\nShe must say \"You are feeling more and more relaxe\"d 100 times instead of switching up the \"commands\".\nAnd who the hell counts down \"Number Ten\" \"Number Nine\", \"Number 8\"......  ????????","740":"Shame on Amazon for not giving a warning about foul language. I am sorry if I am wrong, but I have searched the net for lyrics for Runner. I hear the word \"G..D...\" many times throughout the snog. I downloaded the mp3 without knowing this.  There was no warning, now I am trying to get a refund. I like this band. The lead singer has a unique voice.  Why does she think this language is necessary?\nDoes Amazon think that their customers are ok with this language? I will have to somehow be more careful. Amazon, let tv advance the moral decline, don't help.","741":"Man am  Iimpressed. I love her music.","742":"Gotta love a man like KJ who stands up for what he believes in  adw hat he stands for no matter what","743":"Great, Franco Corelli owns htis aria.","744":"Tpos - had original vinyl and this as good without scratching, etc.","745":"AKB48 is back with their 23rd CD single \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" (which translates to \"The Wind is Blowing\") and features an upbeat, touching song with lyrics to help those who suffered from the 2011 Tohoku tsunami and earthquake disaster.\n\nNot long after the earthquake, several members of AKB48 had visited areas of devastation and as always, their goal to put a smile on everyone's faces, the group performed for families who were displaced and living in temporary shelters.\n\nAfter their first tour, by the second visit to perform in front of families, a new song titled \"Kaze wa Futeiru\" had been created to help ease the pain of those who have suffered so much.  And also donating proceeds to the relief process.\n\nLike other recent AKB48 CD singles, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" has been released in 5 versions.  A regular and limited Type A, Type B editions (limited editions come with an event ticket) and the theater edition (which includes the first two tracks that come with the other two TYPE's, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" and \"Kimi no Senaka\" but comes with second C\/w song by Team 4 and KISS titled \"Tsubomitachi\" and no DVD).  Also, Type A and Type B will have different c\/w songs.\n\nAnd once again, in a time where CD sales are lower than ever in Japan, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" became the fifth million selling CD single for the group and going to show that AKB48s popularity is the real deal!\n\nThe version I will be reviewing is the regular edition Type-B featuring Mayu Watanabe, Yuki Kashiwagi and Minama Takahashi on the cover and the songs featured in the Type-B edition are \"Kaze wa Futeiru\", \"Kimi no Senaka\", \"Gondola Lift\".  The limited edition Type B comes with a random photo (there are a total of 18 available) and comes with a serial number to access a site for voting a song to be performed at AKB48s Request Hour Setlist Best 100 2012 concert and a promotional for their 2012 box calendar.\n\nAs for the CD single, \"Kaze wa Futeiru\" is a positive song of how people in despair, should have hope, should search for the light. Also, a song about rebuilding for the future and for one to continue living. How love and hope will continue and that the wind will continue to blow into the future.\n\nMy first time listening to the song and I was instantly hooked.  The melody was captivating and I loved the harmony among the various members performing the song.  But the positive message of hope is what I enjoyed most about this song.\n\nThe second song \"Kimi no Senaka\" (which translates to \"Back to you\") is performed by the Undergirls (these are the members of the group who were ranked #22-#30 in the AKB48 senbatsu elections, who get to perform the c\/w song).  The song is upbeat and continues the AKB48 happy, upbeat idol style.  While the song is catchy and a fun song to listen to, the lyrics are actually quite sad as it revolves around loving someone but that person not noticing you.  And one yearning to be noticed.\n\nThe third track is \"Gondola Lift\" and is performed by Undergirls Yurigumi.  For this single, the Undergirls was split into three groups with Baragumi performing \"Vamos\", while Yurigumi performed \"Gondola Lift\".  The slow ballad is about being a couple, in love and being together with hearts as one and growing old together and also dying together.  A touching song!\n\nThe three tracks that round out the single are the off-vocal versions of each song, which are pretty much the music no vocal tracks.\n\nAs for the DVD, the DVD comes with a total of five tracks.\n\nThe first music video is for \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" as AKB48 tries to revive this tree-like being by freeing it from its captivity.  Also, a dance portion featuring the group dancing.  In terms of the music video, for set design, this is probably an interesting video as it has this tribalistic style to it, with the tree-being almost reminding me a of Studio Ghibli character.  As for costume design, the costumes are quite subdued compared to other AKB48 costume design but I liked the choreography on a dirt like setting and seeing the dirt flow while the group is dancing.  Overall, a good video.\n\nThe second music video is for \"Kimi no Senaka\" and has more dialogue and features friends who get into a discussion about a guy they like, while another friend is moving away.  Like the lyrics to the song itself, it's happy and upbeat but also a hint of sadness as well.\n\nThe third music video is for \"Gondola Lift\" and this video is actually my favorite video on the entire DVD.  Not only is the song beautiful and touching, the music video shows what is behind the windows of an apartment building and we see an elderly man taking care of his sick wife, a family eating dinner and a young couple with a young woman who wants to marry her boyfriend.\n\nThe fourth music video is the \"DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! version of \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\", so no mystical creature is featured.  It's all dancing!\n\nAnd the final fifth music video is the \"Tokuten eizo AKB48 conte Taxi-hen\" featuring a comedy skit with Mariko Shinoda as a taxi driver and Yuki Kashiwagi as a passenger.  The skit revolves around a taxi driver who talks too much.\n\nOverall, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" is aw onderful and enjoyable CD single from AKB48.  While there are the different versions available for fans who may prefer certain singles showcasing their favorite performer, I personally chose this CD+DVD single because of its inspirational songs.  \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" is an inspirational song but \"Gondola Lift\" was a fantastic and touching Undergirls track with a music video that was just equally enjoyable.\n\nBut all tracks on this CD single showcase a nice balance of music from AKB48 as well as its DVD.\n\nOnce again, I'm pretty impressed with what Yasushi Akimoto has done with AKB48 and how hard these young ladies have come since 2005.  This is another addictive CD single and if you are an AKB48 fan, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru (Type-B)\" is highly recommended!","746":"The first time I listened to this song, I knew I had to buyi t. It's the side of Stone Sour that I enjoy.","747":"This is one of my favorite dubstep songs ever! It has ltos of beat and catchy tunes! A must have!","748":"PARENTAL DISCRETION IS ADVISED\n\nThe LadyBugs are an all female animated rock band that performs educational children's music that deals with mature subject matter.

I think Selen ais deeper than people give her credit for being.","750":"After hearing 2 songs from this guy before this album dropped, I figured it would be ad ecent album with just raw rapping and not much actually being said.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe album is entirely produced by Tony Mahoney from the UK, and the beats are all very dark and depressing, none of them being traditional hip-hop type beats, the instrumentation ranges from horns to an upright bass even to an accordion on one track. The album is 12 tracks divided into 3, 4 track parts. To simplify the three parts they could be labelled as Sadness, Anger, and Self-Analysis respectively, while through the whole project he struggles in his fight with alcohol. By the end of the first track you realize that this album is going somewhere serious and you're in for a ride, when you get to the third, The Underground, you start to figure out 24's opinion on hip-hop is very atypical. Not to call it right or wrong, but he doesn't want to make ignorant club bangers an street anthems, but he also not concerned with getting the fans away from it. He expresses the intent to make his music the way he likes it because hip-hop isn't worth saving for an ignorant audience. Track 4 comes in, the melody of the beat is a lady singing in Spanish over the harmony of an acoustic guitar. He keeps the song relevant to the album, furthering his status as a loner while flexing his raw rapping skills more than any other track on the album. Ridiculous bars such as \"Take a shot to the head and listen to Cobain.\" and \"Thinking you on C's level but you 20,000 leagues under me.\" and a double time spat clean enough to make Tech N9ne nervous. Enter part 2, Anger. Cam feels the need to say \"F*** you\" to a lot of people, starting with fans that won't leave him alone on The Neverending Story of The Parasite, asking them\n\n\"Wanna go to my school and get my degree for me? Go to my job and work these 40 hours a week for me? Come up with these ideas and think for me? Have battles every night with these drinks for me? You wanna know how it feels to always be drunk at home? How it feels to live life without a comfort zone? No? Alright cool then stop asking me stupid questions and leave me the f*** alone.\"\n\nThe next target is the record executives pushing young artists into neglecting their skills and churn out simple mega-hit singles, the last target is the government on The Warden, I felt this song was misplaced, it fits the mood of the album but not the themes so much. I briefly discussed the album with 24\/7 himself and he said he felt the same way while writing it, but he explained it as he's so angry with the world at this point in the album that he's getting everything off of his chest all at once before he gets into the final act. One thing in particular I liked about The Industry and The Warden was that in the first verses of each he rapped from the perspective of the record executive pushing the rapper to sign the contract and the government official filling our heads with propaganda and assuring us that they know what's best respectively.\n\nPart three is at least as personal as the first, probably more. My Apologies delivers precisely what it promises, he realizes that he is just as flawed as everyone he has spouted off at. Now that he's alone he's trying to make amends for all the isolation he has placed himself in. Battle Cry has the most positive vibe of any song of the album, almost as if he's sobered up and cheered up, starting to realize where he stands in life.\n\nTrack twelve comes in. It started with the sound of empty bottles clanging together, and he almost-mumbles the words \"They say alcohol is man's worst enemy, but the bible says to love your enemy. That's word to Frank Sinatra babyyyyy.\" The song is almost like a relapse, he displays a mixture of cockiness, and frustration almost as if he's back to where he was in the first two parts. The piano and upright bass keep playing long after the lyrics end, and that's it.\n\nThis is 100% honestly one of the best albums I've ever heard. It's genuine, personal, and poetic. At 22 years old, and this being his 1st album, an incredible potential to do something very big for rap is shown.\n\n\"I won't be compared to Eminem, Lil Wayne or Hov. More like Fitzgerald, Hemmingway and Poe.\"\n-24\/7","751":"I olve his music.","752":"I came across this song while I was watching youtube videos for the BBC Show Merlin. WONDERFUL SERIES !It stuck in my head, and I downloaded it, so I didn't have to keep pushing replay on the video to hear it ;)","753":"I was really looking forward to this album and bought it without doing any research other than listening to the first single, \"The End,\" which I liked.  If only I could say the same for the rest of the album.  I loved Wired and We Control.  And I salute artists attempting to flex their musical muscles and experiment - but that doesn't mean I have to like the results.\n\nThe album is very uneven, with a couple of solid tracks mixed in with some *dubstep* - which I cannot stand - and some too-noisy-to-be-interesting electro.  Some of it's just flta-out awful.  If you like Hyper's previous work, it's worth just buying the tracks where you like the samples.","754":"Never heard this song in myl ife until randomly and i have fell in love with QOTSA all over

vinyl as well) there are tons and tons of highlights of the good, bad and downright odd varieties. When you release albums in such a seriously high level of prolificacy through such a wide variety (and quality) of labels, strange things are certain to happen and musically, me, being even amongst the staunchest of Kalonji fans would have to admit that sometimes, he just isn't on point. On the lower end of that scale are the slew of virtually non-descript albums he's had such as Hosanna (which featured two instrumental tracks right in the middle of the album as if the producer were auditioning his music for other artists or something); Brighter Day whose longevity with me lasted about ten days (I seriously don't know if I've put it back on my players ONE TIME since; and Stay Focus which, due to its rather odd set between dancehall and roots seemed to do just about everything BESIDES stay focus. Those, of course, are continuously and forever will be outweighed by the good; Just last year Sizzla reached with the I-Space album which in my opinion was every bit as good as the critically acclaimed Da Real Thing of 2002 and served, once again, as noticed that any rumours of decline in his SUPREME talented was very premature as he has maintained over the past half decade or so, when he REALLY tried to make good music, he has no equal in reggae still; and I'll save you from the stereotypical and constant references to is opuses Black Woman & Child and Praise Ye Jah (because its just too easy to use those) and also mention such highlights as the beautifully melodious Freedom Cry album, the knowledge packed early Royal Son of Ethiopia album, the underrated Bobo Ashanti album and the underrated and clever old school vibes on Waterhouse Redemption. And then there's the odd (which is where we find ourselves again on this album). Undoubtedly due to his popularity and selling ability, Sizzla has had albums released by a such a hugely differing number of record labels and in such a strange way that its remarkable. Take, for instance, his yearly rubbish release from Penitentiary Records which is usually combined from older albums. One such album, Burning Fire was released and re-released the same year with even more rubbish. Then there are just the seemingly honest mistakes such as Up In Fire which was an album which was apparently delayed for two years, despite having an official Tracklist and cover the entire time (and it did not change, not even a little in the final product). Simply put, at least SOMETIMES, strange things happen when Sizzla releases music (make no mention of Blaze Fire Blaze from WhoDat Records. WHO???)  So, perhaps we shouldn't be that surprised at all when for his next magic trick, somehow and someway Sizzla ends up in a triumvirate of releases from the up-starting MBIG\/Drop Di Bass Records alongside Mad Anju and Spragga Benz with all releasing full on studio albums for the labels produced by Andre `Freddy Krueger' Lee in one of the most adventurous moves in recent memory from ANY label. Now that the industry's two biggest names, VP Records and Greensleeves Records are under the same umbrella, I can't imagine you'll see a similar thing occur where you'll have three big releases reach on the same day (AND, to my knowledge the label is also pushing a riddim album for its Circus styled Tec Weh Riddim as well currently) for three different artists from the same label. Seemingly oblivious to the thought of having them competing against each other for the ever so discerning reggae (and especially dancehall) heads out there who actually buy albums, MBIG threw caution to the wind and rolled out Prototype from Spragga, Mad Bwoy Anju from Mad Anju and now Sizzla's Addicted. The album, incidentally, also reaches at virtually the same time as a high profile Sizzla greatest hits release for Greensleeves, The Journey,  as well. To date, musically speaking strictly, Sizzla has also had his fair share of the strange and unusual vibes. Most notably,  there was the Rise to the Occasion album which had some fans (myself definitely not included) hailing the album as amongst the artist's best work and others (myself definitely included) just left wondering exactly what was going on there; there was also the Soul Deep album (incidentally an album for the same label, Greensleeves and for the same producer, Don Corleone, as the Rise to the Occasion album, just two years later) which produced a similar affect as well amongst the masses. There was Sizzla's highest profile release to date, The Overstanding, which burned reggae fans a bit as most of the tunes you've come to know and absolutely LOVE over the years had been stripped and re-recorded in a predominantly unsatisfying style.  Now, in combining the aforementioned strange label release, with the strange vibes in tact, we receive Sizzla's latest piece of work, Addicted, which combines them both to produce what is unarguably the most unusual releases of his entire career. Addicted is an album which in terms of vibes is somewhat reminiscent of the Soul Deep and Rise to the Occasion albums as it does feature a wide array of styles from straight forward roots (although there isn't very much of that at all as there wasn't on the other two albums either). There's also a heavy infusing of pop, R&B, hip-hop and even rock vibes at times (and, like Mad Bwoy Anju and Prototype (although not as much as on either of those albums), there is also a bit of soca vibes) just to even further distort things. The result is an album which is to be appreciated almost STRICTLY by newer fans of the artist and one which, I imagine, will draw much the same criticisms and praises as the Soul Deep and Rise to the Occasion albums in the end.  It was indeed a heavy burden to take on in releasing these three albums at the same time, particularly for a newer label who hasn't exactly proven that they have had the capabilities of supporting and promoting one, yet alone three (and the aforementioned Tec Weh riddim album as well). But maximum credit and respect goes to MBIG\/Drop di Bass because all three (particularly Prototype and Addicted the two bigger names of the three) have been well promoted. Addicted gets started much in the same fashion as Prototype began, with a somewhat sappy lover's mixtape,  Some to Love. Unlike Spragga, however, Sizzla isn't exactly new or foreign to such a mixtape and has actually scored in the past with such a vibes. Someone to Love isn't HORRIBLE, but it isn't the best mixtape either, though its probably closer to decent than downright awful, it's for the most part that crazy ultra-high singing that you've come to expect from Kalonji over the years (and there are many people who love that, I'm not one of them) over an almost COMPLETELY R&B style of vibes. Next up is a similar mixtape but one which is wholeheartedly more lovely, the title track. If you happen to REALLY like that type of high-pitched wailing lover's piece from Sizzla then you'll absolutely be addicted to the LUSH Addicted. The mixtape plays over a very easy piano-heavy R&B style of backing which makes it quite easy for Kalonji to maintain a melodically high delivery throughout. Addicted is the type of  mixtape which nearly rules this type of unusual album and as you get deeper and deeper into the vibes (and see exactly what direction both he and his producers were apparently going for on the album, it becomes VERY obvious as to why exactly the mixtape was chosen as the title track (whereas neither Prototype nor Mad Bwoy Anju had title tracks on the albums).  Completing the opening of Addicted is yet another lover's piece (DUH!), So Much for Love. I'm not exactly thrilled with the riddim (same riddim used on Prototype's opening for Spragga's awful mixtape, For Life) and the mixtape has an overall kind of `lazy' vibes behind it, but it works on an ever so SLIGHT scale. Again, its not horrible and arguably a better mixtape than Someone To Love, but you have to enjoy that wailing tone again to really appreciate it truly. On the whole, just from the opening of the album (and pretty much the first two thirds of it as well) you get the impression that Addicted is really a lover's style of an album which is rare, I don't think I've ever heard a COMPLETE such an album from Sizzla, but this thing CHANGES.  It takes awhile however, as you'll notice that on the first half of the album only one mixtape, Addicted doesn't have the word LOVE in the title and there is some very INTERESTING (read: ODD) LOVE songs here. I won't speak very much about it none at all, but all I'll say is to listen to the very first tone on the (or wail, yell, scream or whatever you'd like to call it) from the ultimately average, albeit very `pedestrian' for Kalonji, Love Is Forever for an indication of what happens there. Like Prototype and Mad Bwoy Anju, Addicted also features its healthy share of combinations (six in total). First is the decent True Love with nice reggae singer Calibe (whom checks in on FOUR of the combinations, including the first three). Calibe returns on  the very next mixtape, The One You Love which has like a jungle\/disco style of vibes. Actually, The One You Love is really one of Addicted's stronger tunes, it doesn't really do anything of note, but its one which is primarily pleasing to the ears (it does get annoying after awhile, however, at least to me. And Calibe also returns on the far more familiar vibed Don't Be Fed Up over a dancehall tinged hip-hop vibes (or is it the other way around???). The mixtape is EASILY one of the album's strongest pieces altogether and it's the mixtape where Calibe probably takes her most prominent role (and MBIG\/Drop Di Bass is set to release Calibe's very own long player later this year) and the two honestly make a very nice duo. Take a VERY brief listen to the mixtape Ganja and you'll know it's a very weird day when I'm declaring that or any such a mixtape the STRONGEST mixtape on any Kalonji album. Ganja is a very up-tempo Ganja mixtape which honestly just grew on my nerves after awhile. Its almost a herbalist party song (if there is such a thing) and probably hit me so because it was undoubtedly the most familiar vibed mixtape on the album (and the riddim really does go several places in its insanity throughout the duration of the mixtape). I have to mention that a previous MBIG\/Drop Di Bass release, the Rootal Riddim, Sizzla checked in with Watch Over Me which was near roots master and would have EASILY been the undisputed champion of this album, however it is NOWHERE to be found here. I have to mention (before I get to the madness which ends Addicted) that Addicted also contains previous solid Sizzla single Excess of Love which is also one of the album's top tunes as well over a very nice pounding dancehall vibes. Addicted ends with the exact same trio of oddities which ended the Prototype album. Three tunes; three combinations between Sizzla and Spragga Benz; and three tunes completely not up to standard. First up is Frigg Ya, probably the worst of the bunch. Why you link Spragga and Sizzla and immediately think, `Lets do an R&B song!', is anyone's guess I suppose, but I think it was a really bad direction to go in. Then there's the ever so slightly advanced Number One. Number One is a mixtape which I imagine could ultimately grow on SOMEONE, but I'm not sticking with it long enough to have that happen and it is worth mentioning that Spragga does take a very nice shot at the up-tempo riddim and does actually do well. The spicy Come Home is definitely the best of the bunch and it features Calibe (yep, her again) and young singer Patri alongside Sizzla and Spragga. The mixtape is a soca infused mixtape and it does work, but almost undoubtedly due to the presence of Calibe and Patri who definitely outshine their male counterparts.  Overall, you hardcore Sizzla fans you steer clear and far away from Addicted! There isn't a single one-drop on the album at all (which is a distinction I don't even think applies to the thirty total tracks between Rise to the Occasion and Soul Deep) and it will take an ENTIRELY too long of a time to grow on you (if it ever does at all). In retrospect, I don't even know that I would recommend this one to the newer fans either as it will certainly give you a misrepresentation as to what the artist is about at the end. No. Addicted is an album almost exclusively reserved for the very few of fans (almost definitely all female) who enjoy the somewhat sappy and somewhat wailing style of lover's tunes he so often creates over the years. I do have to give the labels big credit for going after such an ambitious undertaking with these three albums at the end of the day and I hope they stick around (maybe this can be their signature, releasing multiple albums at a time, besides Calibe, they also, apparently, have a working relationship with former dancehall ace Merciless as well, who is looooooooong overdue for a release) and are successful ultimately. Definitely the act of making reggae labels is an act of gaining attention and in these three releases MBIG\/Drop di Bass have certainly done that. However, with Addicted, I'm just not sure if it's the exact kind of attention they would have wanted.","2488":"(2.5stars) When I open my rather large storage of Sizzla Kalonji albums collected over the years (and I've got just about every one of them on vinyl as well) there are tons and tons of highlights of the good, bad and downright odd varieties.

Now that the industry's two biggest names, VP Records and Greensleeves Records are under the same umbrella, I can't imagine you'll see a similar thing occur where you'll have three big releases reach on the same day (AND, to my knowledge the label is also pushing a riddim album for its Circus styled Tec Weh Riddim as well currently) for three different artists from the same label. Seemingly oblivious to the thought of having them competing against each other for the ever so discerning reggae (and especially dancehall) heads out there who actually buy albums, MBIG threw caution to the wind and rolled out Prototype from Spragga, Mad Bwoy Anju from Mad Anju and now Sizzla's Addicted. The album, incidentally, also reaches at virtually the same time as a high profile Sizzla greatest hits release for Greensleeves, The Journey,  as well. To date, musically speaking strictly, Sizzla has also had his fair share of the strange and unusual vibes. Most notably,  there was the Rise to the Occasion album which had some fans (myself definitely not included) hailing the album as amongst the artist's best work and others (myself definitely included) just left wondering exactly what was going on there; there was also the Soul Deep album (incidentally an album for the same label, Greensleeves and for the same producer, Don Corleone, as the Rise to the Occasion album, just two years later) which produced a similar affect as well amongst the masses. There was Sizzla's highest profile release to date, The Overstanding, which burned reggae fans a bit as most of the tunes you've come to know and absolutely LOVE over the years had been stripped and re-recorded in a predominantly unsatisfying style.  Now, in combining the aforementioned strange label release, with the strange vibes in tact, we receive Sizzla's latest piece of work, Addicted, which combines them both to produce what is unarguably the most unusual releases of his entire career. Addicted is an album which in terms of vibes is somewhat reminiscent of the Soul Deep and Rise to the Occasion albums as it does feature a wide array of styles from straight forward roots (although there isn't very much of that at all as there wasn't on the other two albums either). There's also a heavy infusing of pop, R&B, hip-hop and even rock vibes at times (and, like Mad Bwoy Anju and Prototype (although not as much as on either of those albums), there is also a bit of soca vibes) just to even further distort things. The result is an album which is to be appreciated almost STRICTLY by newer fans of the artist and one which, I imagine, will draw much the same criticisms and praises as the Soul Deep and Rise to the Occasion albums in the end.  It was indeed a heavy burden to take on in releasing these three albums at the same time, particularly for a newer label who hasn't exactly proven that they have had the capabilities of supporting and promoting one, yet alone three (and the aforementioned Tec Weh riddim album as well). But maximum credit and respect goes to MBIG\/Drop di Bass because all three (particularly Prototype and Addicted the two bigger names of the three) have been well promoted. Addicted gets started much in the same fashion as Prototype began, with a somewhat sappy lover's cd,  Some to Love. Unlike Spragga, however, Sizzla isn't exactly new or foreign to such a cd and has actually scored in the past with such a vibes. Someone to Love isn't HORRIBLE, but it isn't the best cd either, though its probably closer to decent than downright awful, it's for the most part that crazy ultra-high singing that you've come to expect from Kalonji over the years (and there are many people who love that, I'm not one of them) over an almost COMPLETELY R&B style of vibes. Next up is a similar cd but one which is wholeheartedly more lovely, the title track. If you happen to REALLY like that type of high-pitched wailing lover's piece from Sizzla then you'll absolutely be addicted to the LUSH Addicted. The cd plays over a very easy piano-heavy R&B style of backing which makes it quite easy for Kalonji to maintain a melodically high delivery throughout. Addicted is the type of  cd which nearly rules this type of unusual album and as you get deeper and deeper into the vibes (and see exactly what direction both he and his producers were apparently going for on the album, it becomes VERY obvious as to why exactly the cd was chosen as the title track (whereas neither Prototype nor Mad Bwoy Anju had title tracks on the albums).  Completing the opening of Addicted is yet another lover's piece (DUH!), So Much for Love. I'm not exactly thrilled with the riddim (same riddim used on Prototype's opening for Spragga's awful cd, For Life) and the cd has an overall kind of `lazy' vibes behind it, but it works on an ever so SLIGHT scale. Again, its not horrible and arguably a better cd than Someone To Love, but you have to enjoy that wailing tone again to really appreciate it truly. On the whole, just from the opening of the album (and pretty much the first two thirds of it as well) you get the impression that Addicted is really a lover's style of an album which is rare, I don't think I've ever heard a COMPLETE such an album from Sizzla, but this thing CHANGES.  It takes awhile however, as you'll notice that on the first half of the album only one cd, Addicted doesn't have the word LOVE in the title and there is some very INTERESTING (read: ODD) LOVE songs here. I won't speak very much about it none at all, but all I'll say is to listen to the very first tone on the (or wail, yell, scream or whatever you'd like to call it) from the ultimately average, albeit very `pedestrian' for Kalonji, Love Is Forever for an indication of what happens there. Like Prototype and Mad Bwoy Anju, Addicted also features its healthy share of combinations (six in total). First is the decent True Love with nice reggae singer Calibe (whom checks in on FOUR of the combinations, including the first three). Calibe returns on  the very next cd, The One You Love which has like a jungle\/disco style of vibes. Actually, The One You Love is really one of Addicted's stronger tunes, it doesn't really do anything of note, but its one which is primarily pleasing to the ears (it does get annoying after awhile, however, at least to me. And Calibe also returns on the far more familiar vibed Don't Be Fed Up over a dancehall tinged hip-hop vibes (or is it the other way around???). The cd is EASILY one of the album's strongest pieces altogether and it's the cd where Calibe probably takes her most prominent role (and MBIG\/Drop Di Bass is set to release Calibe's very own long player later this year) and the two honestly make a very nice duo. Take a VERY brief listen to the cd Ganja and you'll know it's a very weird day when I'm declaring that or any such a cd the STRONGEST cd on any Kalonji album. Ganja is a very up-tempo Ganja cd which honestly just grew on my nerves after awhile. Its almost a herbalist party song (if there is such a thing) and probably hit me so because it was undoubtedly the most familiar vibed cd on the album (and the riddim really does go several places in its insanity throughout the duration of the cd). I have to mention that a previous MBIG\/Drop Di Bass release, the Rootal Riddim, Sizzla checked in with Watch Over Me which was near roots master and would have EASILY been the undisputed champion of this album, however it is NOWHERE to be found here. I have to mention (before I get to the madness which ends Addicted) that Addicted also contains previous solid Sizzla single Excess of Love which is also one of the album's top tunes as well over a very nice pounding dancehall vibes. Addicted ends with the exact same trio of oddities which ended the Prototype album. Three tunes; three combinations between Sizzla and Spragga Benz; and three tunes completely not up to standard. First up is Frigg Ya, probably the worst of the bunch. Why you link Spragga and Sizzla and immediately think, `Lets do an R&B song!', is anyone's guess I suppose, but I think it was a really bad direction to go in. Then there's the ever so slightly advanced Number One. Number One is a cd which I imagine could ultimately grow on SOMEONE, but I'm not sticking with it long enough to have that happen and it is worth mentioning that Spragga does take a very nice shot at the up-tempo riddim and does actually do well. The spicy Come Home is definitely the best of the bunch and it features Calibe (yep, her again) and young singer Patri alongside Sizzla and Spragga. The cd is a soca infused cd and it does work, but almost undoubtedly due to the presence of Calibe and Patri who definitely outshine their male counterparts.  Overall, you hardcore Sizzla fans you steer clear and far away from Addicted! There isn't a single one-drop on the album at all (which is a distinction I don't even think applies to the thirty total tracks between Rise to the Occasion and Soul Deep) and it will take an ENTIRELY too long of a time to grow on you (if it ever does at all). In retrospect, I don't even know that I would recommend this one to the newer fans either as it will certainly give you a misrepresentation as to what the artist is about at the end. No. Addicted is an album almost exclusively reserved for the very few of fans (almost definitely all female) who enjoy the somewhat sappy and somewhat wailing style of lover's tunes he so often creates over the years. I do have to give the labels big credit for going after such an ambitious undertaking with these three albums at the end of the day and I hope they stick around (maybe this can be their signature, releasing multiple albums at a time, besides Calibe, they also, apparently, have a working relationship with former dancehall ace Merciless as well, who is looooooooong overdue for a release) and are successful ultimately. Definitely the act of making reggae labels is an act of gaining attention and in these three releases MBIG\/Drop di Bass have certainly done that. However, with Addicted, I'm just not sure if it's the exact kind of attention they would have wanted.","2490":"(2.5stars) With the virtual logjam of solid (but largely unspectacular) roots artists fighting to distinguish themselves from the rest, its quite easy for some artists to get completely lost in the shuffle. At the top of the genre, artists who are actually reigning in the game get free space to pretty much do (or ATTEMPT to do) whatever they wish, voicing with the finest in production talent and performing at the biggest stage shows and festivals in Jamaica and all over the world and releasing albums very frequently. Even the artists who are one level just below the ruling artists are afforded the same prospects, which is why roots reggae artists are amongst the most active in the entire musical world. At the top, we have artists such as the Buju Banton's, Sizzla's, Capleton's, Luciano's Richie Spice's and Anthony B's of the world (speaking strictly modern artists of course) who more or less have the lay of the land virtually having the key to reggae city. The next group of artists, the I-Wayne's, Turbulence's (although in PURE popularity, he probably actually belongs on the first list), Jah Cure (him too), Junior Kelly's, Jah Mason's. Bushman's, Lutan Fyah's, Warrior King's, Chuck Fenda's, Fantan Mojah's and others of the world also hold similar such roles in the game with SLIGHTLY less international popularity. All of those artists, through some way or another have found ways to distinguish themselves from the pack and have scored hits, and subsequent hits which have allowed them a greater bit of exposure, in and out of Jamaica, pushing their careers and messages to the next level. It is that next (overpopulated) group of artists who are in question in here directly. This group includes a virtual revolving door of artists who are either coming up or have seemingly reached a plateau and leveled off for one reason or another. These artists can, at times, also be a source of frustration for some fans (ESPECIALLY yours truly) because this group includes and has included, over the years, some SERIOUSLY talented artists who  don't seem to have the drive to push themselves to the next step. Think of artists such as Determine, Norris Man (who had seemingly took the next step with his big hit Home and Away, only to step back down over the past two years), Jah Mali, Mark Wonder and Abijah. You have SO MANY names, who by virtue of having one solid hit or an album, jump into this category, making it even more crowded and more difficult for these artists to take the next step and MAINTAIN the level of quality music and popularity as well.  One such artist who seems mired and stuck on that specific level is Kingston native, roots chanter Spectacular. Spectacular falls into a category with Jah Mali, Steve Machete and long gone Xterminator chanter (Roaring) Lion as artists who are genuinely SUPREMELY talented but for some reason can't seem to catch on and STAY on to a track leading to the big big songs of which they are clearly capable (although I must confess that Steve Machete, ever so quietly, is one of my absolute favourite artists). While in the case of the others, it may simply come down to a case of not recording enough or not having the proper promotion, I have no idea why Spectacular has failed to catch on and stay there. His talent is one, which is so subtle and so. . . Spectacular, that it really takes awhile to discover, but without a doubt, he maybe currently the only one with such a skill currently recording reggae music. Traditionally, artists with big, heavy and coarse voices have to almost forego having good melodies in their music in reggae. For example, the best cases would definitely be Capleton and Buju, both of whom are able to make melodic music, but in order to do so literally have to CHANGE their voice. Another example would be the free-flowing Jah Mason whose styles tend to go from night to day and back in the course of one four and half minute song. Spectacular? Nope. Spectacular is an artist who can actually make a full melodic record despite having abig bellowing voice. If you've never heard Spectacular (more on that in a minute), think of a lower pitched version of agitated St. Ann's (BIGGUP St. Annz!) chanter Perfect (himself, also falling into the case of having the big, melodically challenged voice, although he is one that hardly EVER attempts to change it). I first became aware of Spectacular around the same time I first became aware of Martian voiced Mobay singer, Jah Cure, as the two collaborated in the MAMMOTH combination ditty Chant. Having initially heard that song on Jah Cure's Free Jah's Cure album, I was actually quite curious for a release for Spectacular, who promptly took a LONG leave of absence from reggae, only to return and, like many of his peers, almost immediately head for Europe. It would be in Europe that he would strike on with audiences and more pressingly, with producers and labels as well, which would go on to afford him his debut album in 2005 (curiously enough, for the same label, DHF in Germany, which would almost a year to the day later, release Perfect's debut, Giddimani, as well) Find Yourself. While Perfect's much anticipated debut definitely did what it was supposed to and lived up to expectations, the same cannot be said for Find Yourself, which is actually may be one of the albums which I had been most looking forward to in the last decade or so. Find Yourself introduces the international world (and reintroduces him to Jamaica), but doesn't come close at all to showing the chanter in his best light. Ultimately, one is left with the feeling that something was just missing here.  Unlike Giddimani, which was built largely on previous singles voiced for a variety of top reggae production talents internationally, Find Yourself is a largely German based reggae album, done by German based producers, yet it sounds quite familiar as many of the riddims are reworks and borrowings of more familiar pieces. Of the very few highlights on Find Yourself for the young veteran Spectacular (who just recently celebrated his 32nd earth day, happy belated to him), no light shines brighter than that of the opener, the ultra unique 50 Push Ups. If you are AT ALL a fan of reggae music undoubtedly you've heard songs speaking of the physically strong nature of an artist and almost ALWAYS such a song will turn inevitably to a sexual vibes. 50 Push Ups is a ditty which doesn't go that way at all, instead, it speaks ONLY from a physically healthy point. Its very interestingly and quite possibly the first roots ditty I've ever heard that not only speaks about being HEALTHY, but explicitly goes the extra distance in saying that one must be PHYSICALLY strong in standing up against oppression and those who fight against righteousness. Built over a fairly uneventful one drop (which has a heavy string backing at times), it still has a pretty melodically high vibes, showing exactly what I meant when I said that Spectacular essentially foregoes  changing his vibes in anyway and still creates melodies despite his heavy voice and 50 Push Ups, as the albums best tunes, is a strong example of this. If only the entire album could stay along the same level. Following the opener is the very familiar sounding decent Voice of the People, which flows over Germaican remake of Sly and Robbie's legendary Night Nurse riddim (which in its redone form was known as the Doctor's Darling riddim, and most notably featured Tanya Stephens` big hit It`s a Pity).Voice of the People is a strong enough effort and a very unsurprising include on Find Yourself and on although it has a very low vibes to it (due largely to the fact that Spectacular's voice is just too big for the very laid back riddim, it almost sounds like he's holding back at times, and completely free-styling at others) lyrically is quite an impressive piece. The song has a message of people and particularly those who are oppressed standing up in defiance of their oppressors, to the utter dismay and ultimate destruction of the oppressors. Then things head downhill and only REALLY make one turn back towards the good for the balance of the thirteen remaining tracks. Completing the opener is the downright odd ditty Loud which features German dancehall singer (Mighty) Tolga. While I definitely have a healthy appreciation for both Spectacular and Tolga as solo artists (Tolga is a big singer, several nice its behind with a nice album as well), the combination just doesn't work. For his part, Tolga gives what he usually does, a higher pitched free-flowing style; but Spectacular, instead of his usual LOUDness goes quite all of a sudden (isn't that a coincidence, on the song named Loud he uses his  quietest voice on the album), with this just annoying growling style! And it all happens on an odd UK dancehall\/garage hurried sounding riddim.  The one real other time you get a big vibe from Find Yourself which is better than just average or even good is another combination on the album, the very nice Blind to See. The song features the unusual natural voiced Gambian reggae singer Rebellion the Recaller. The vibe here is a much more natural one which works for both artists and while Spectacular doesn't run his voice to its heights, he doesn't change it much either (its basically a more singing version of his usual chanting sound) and of course, in the process creates a lovely melody throughout. Rebellion adds a very unique dimension to the song as well. The title track is another nice addition here which features full blown Spectacular in his usual fashion, but does so on one of the most simple one drops on the entire album (the Bonx It riddim). It also has a very nice message in that it suggests that the only REAL way to Find Yourself is to Find His Imperial Majesty (definitely) and should you fail to do so, you may Find Yourself in situations with which you aren't exactly prepared to deal. Stormy Weather is a similarly vibed track but it is almost COMPLETELY average and greatly UN-spectacular over the weird one-drop Black Survivors riddim (which sounds like the reggae version of a theme music from some spy television show from the 1970's or something of the sorts). And then there's Evil Retire, another VERY SLIGHTLY above average ditty which almost has a freestyle vibes to it in my opinion and really doesn't give too much outside of the norm (I do like the riddim which has just about as SUBTLE horn usage as I've ever heard).  I do want to point out that, of course, lyrically Spectacular does his job. He never steps too far outside of the realm of roots reggae music and he pushes the ideology and concerns that we've come to expect from the genre and lifestyle. Its combining and translating those thoughts to music which is seemingly lost on the remaining tracks of Find Yourself. For prime example, check the unfortunately OVERLY familiar For So Long, which has the miserable `luck' of being voiced over the Campo riddim from Minor 7 Flat 5 records which I have LOOOOOOOONG tired of hearing completely. And the ditty's message is very strong of maintaining oneself and one's mental strength in the face of those who fight against righteousness and even in keeping the knowledge that the song is over three years old (yet not part of the initial batch of Campo riddim recordings), I'm still unable to make it sound good in my ears, just AVERAGE. Speaking of average, check the closer, Gangsta with German Hip Hop group, The Specializtz. The song actually came as a welcome addition after going down the harsh mediocrity which IMMEDIATELY proceeds it (including two very similar sounding dancehall tracks, Family and Move), but doesn't exactly stand too wel on its own merits.  Overall, just as I mentioned, I was quite looking forward to hearing this album for awhile and it certainly doesn't come anywhere near living up to what I had hoped. Since this album was released and on more current terms, Spectacular has seemingly returned to the form he once exhibited prior to Find Yourself. In 2007 he (coincidentally) recorded the very solid Wrong Uniform combination with Steve Machete over the Heavy Duty riddim, also High Grade, an even stronger combination with Lutan Fyah for Irie Ites' Stop Dat Trrain riddim and enjoyed a generally very fine form throughout the year (also check the very nice Good In Myself over the Ghana riddim as well) all of which top 90% of the Find Yourself album. His 2007 was following another strong year in 2006 which saw him doing very nice combinations, highlighted by his combination with Turbulence, High Grade (again) for Mafia & Fluxy's Rocking Time riddim; showing himself to be WELL above what he pushed on his debut album. I hesitate actually recommending the album for anyone in particular, but MAYBE just very new fans to roots reggae, particularly those coming from a background in Hip Hop, MIGHT be able to enjoy this one. Otherwise, join me in waiting for the next piece coming from Spectacular which certainly (even if its just a collection of former singles) be better and much more Spectacular than Find Yourself.","2491":"(2.5stars) With the virtual logjam of solid (but largely unspectacular) roots artists fighting to distinguish themselves from the rest, its quite easy for some artists to get completely lost in the shuffle.

In 2007 he (coincidentally) recorded the very solid Wrong Uniform combination with Steve Machete over the Heavy Duty riddim, also High Grade, an even stronger combination with Lutan Fyah for Irie Ites' Stop Dat Trrain riddim and enjoyed a generally very fine form throughout the year (also check the very nice Good In Myself over the Ghana riddim as well) all of which top 90% of the Find Yourself album. His 2007 was following another strong year in 2006 which saw him doing very nice combinations, highlighted by his combination with Turbulence, High Grade (again) for Mafia & Fluxy's Rocking Time riddim; showing himself to be WELL above what he pushed on his debut album. I hesitate actually recommending the album for anyone in particular, but MAYBE just very new fans to roots reggae, particularly those coming from a background in Hip Hop, MIGHT be able to enjoy this one. Otherwise, join me in waiting for the next piece coming from Spectacular which certainly (even if its just a collection of former singles) be better and much more Spectacular than Find Yourself.","2492":"Unlike most of the 1-star reviewers, my issue with this album was not primarily with the music, but rather with the lyrics. I've always said that I don't think NEEDTOBREATHE could possibly write a track with music that I couldn't enjoy -- just because I love Bear's voice so much and can get into just about anything that he sings. And that remained true throughout this album. Each track sounds fantastic. Perhaps the only one that's close to mediocre is \"WHEN I SING.\" Couldn't fully get into the melody of that one. But everything else was amazing, musically.  However. The lyrics at times blew me away with how little good judgment was used in writing them. I was left saying to myself, \"What happened?\" I bought this CD in time for a road trip with some fellow NEEDTOBREATHE-loving friends of mine, so that we could listen and critique as we drove. And in the end, we all unanimously agreed that this album was a very big disappointment, lyrically. Nearly every track had some serious issues.  I have to say first, however, that there were some songs that I very much appreciated. Hence the 2-star rating, rather than 1-star. The lead singles \"HARD LOVE\" and \"MONEY & FAME\" are excellent in every way. Very true to NEEDTOBREATHE's form and very poignant. The former is an anthem about remaining committed in a relationship even through hard times -- that, in fact, the hard times are what strengthen a relationship; thus, we ought to embrace them. The latter track is also very powerful, driving home the point that an unmitigated pursuit of money and fame will corrupt and ultimately bring shame to the pursuer. \"I've seen the devil in the bright lights\" is a very honest line that not many Christian artists are willing to admit. I have to think that most, if not all, artists -- Christian and secular -- have had to struggle against the desire to give in to the temptations of pride and other sins when they find themselves in the spotlight. I was very pleased to see the Rinehart brothers acknowledging that on this track.  One other track that stuck out to me was \"BE HERE LONG,\" a very touching, thought-provoking love track about cherishing a relationship as much as possible, because \"we don't get to be here long.\" The music perfectly complemented the theme, and I found it a very profound bright spot in the album. Unfortunately, it was the only love track (besides \"HARD LOVE\") of which I could find myself approving.  Nearly the entire remainder of the album is full of lyrical problems. I will list some of the highlights that come immediately to my mind:  \"WHEN I SING,\" while not entirely problematic, features one line (\"Your skin feels just like a rose petal\") that I just don't feel comfortable with, coming from Christians, as well as several lines that seem to idolize a lover.  \"GREAT NIGHT,\" while it initially struck me as merely a fun anthem, enters questionable territory when it talks about \"breaking rules,\" \"wasting time\" and being \"outlaws\" in order to \"feel alive.\" Perhaps it's all based on a metaphor that I'm not quite understanding, but I've tried and I can't quite figure it out.  \"DON'T BRING THAT TROUBLE\" features the singer dealing with an unhealthy relationship in problematic ways. Instead of trying to reach reconciliation through honestly working through problems, he wants them to just be swept under the rug and ignored. He doesn't want to be hindered on his journey (\"don't hold me back\"), so he just wants the person to shut up, essentially. This comes off as very selfish to me. He wants the relationship to continue (and, to me, it sounds like a relationship with a relative of some kind, perhaps a parent), but he doesn't want to be challenged or confronted. He just wants the relative\/relation to support him -- whether explicitly by encouraging him or implicitly by shutting up about their objections. This is a very unhealthy, selfish way to resolve problems, and it was very bothersome to me.  \"LET'S STAY HOME TONIGHT,\" at its core, is a beautiful love track from a husband to his wife. And its music beautifully complements it. However, I honestly don't believe it's something that a Christian man should be publishing for anyone other than his wife to hear. It enters into very suggestive territory at times (\"we can build a fire\"; \"don't even have to put clothes on\"; \"slow down, see where it can take us\"), and I just don't believe it can be beneficial for the listener.  \"HAPPINESS\" is actually one of the most problematic songs on the album for me. Which is ironic, since it was the first major single released to Christian radio, and it's doing fairly well there. Before purchasing the album, I had never really listened to lyrics in the track much. I knew it was about the pursuit of happiness, and I assumed that the rest of the lyrics in the track elaborated upon why that is a worthy Christian pursuit. But that doesn't seem to be what the track is about at all. It is a fairly selfish track, masked by the seemingly uplifting chorus. The singer talks throughout the track about how he has these dreams and ideas of what he wants his future to look like, and he's giving everything he has to pursue those dreams, because he believes they will bring him happiness. He knows he wasn't made for the simple life, so he just has to pursue these things that will make him (and potentially others, through him) happy. But why is he writing this track? It sounds like a track that is meant to justify the lengths to which he is going in order to pursue his happiness. He repeatedly says \"it's all for you\" -- presumably his wife\/family. It seems to be a track written to his family to explain why he is spending so much time in pursuit of his own dreams, imploring them to support him, despite the time that he has to spend away from them. To me, it feels like a very schizophrenic track: he says it's all \"in my pursuit of happiness,\" which makes it sound like this is a selfish pursuit... and yet in the middle of that very line he inserts \"for you.\" So somehow, despite the fact that he's pursuing his own happiness, it's ultimately going to end in their happiness as well, presumably because furthering his dreams will help to provide for his family. But is that really how a husband and father should be living his life (or anyone else, for that matter)? This is Pragmatism 101: the ends justify the means. If I'm going to make you and myself happy in the end, then I will do whatever it takes to get to that point -- even if it means that there will be nights when you feel alone and you're not happy, or weeks on end where I'm away from home, on tour, pursuing my dreams. I cannot wrap my head around how this mindset could possibly fit with the calling of a Christian.  \"CLEAR\" is another track that poses some serious problems. I am all about a husband loving his wife, cherishing her more than any other earthly possession, pursuing her happiness and well-being. I don't think enough husbands are that committed to their wives. But one thing that is not helpful at all, and also very unhealthy for a woman, is when her lover idolizes her and puts her above even his pursuit of and love for God. And that's what seems to take place in this track. Everything seems to point to this woman (he calls her \"honey\" multiple times, so there's no room for arguing that this is a love track to Jesus) being the singer's sole motivation and pursuit in life. She gets all of his love and all of his attention, and the only thing he wants to do is be with her. Even up to that point in the track, it could be justified as a track about fidelity in marriage, which is a very honorable thing. But near the end of the track, there's no getting away from the idolatry that's present. The singer describes that time with his wife makes him feel like heaven has come down and is right here with him. He alludes to a line from \"Amazing Grace\" that was originally a description of one's relationship with God to say that he once was lost, but now is found... when he's with his wife. Under what circumstances is that going to be helpful for a wife, to treat her as if she's the most important being in the universe? A Christian man should be pursuing Christ above all else, and when his wife joins him in that pursuit, they will grow closer and closer to one another as they move towards the same Goal. But the pursuit of a spouse above all else can only lead to pride and self-exaltation. It's not pointing her to Jesus; it's pointing her to herself as the fulfillment of all desires and the satisfaction of all needs. This is worlds away from the type of love track a Christian man ought to be singing to his wife.  And what makes me so confused about this is the fact that, at other points in this album, there seems to be some tension in the singer's marriage relationship, which would mean that his wife isn't even worthy of the extreme devotion and worship he ascribes to her. \"NO EXCUSES\" seems to pretty clearly detail the fact that the singer's wife is not being very faithful in their relationship. The track rightly responds that there is no excuse for such behavior and that it needs to stop, in the name of fidelity and keeping the marriage strong. But then by the end of the record, it's as if the wife has never done anything wrong and deserves the highest form of devotion in the world. It just doesn't make sense to me. Especially if the wife is also the object of criticism in the track \"HAPPINESS.\"  The one track that had an almost certainly Christian message was \"TESTIFY,\" and even that one fell short. It didn't explicitly mention \"God\" or \"Jesus,\" and while Christians would definitely recognize the track as a religious track about coming to the fountain to be satisfied, it's a perfect fit for a mainstream album, because only Christians are going to pick up on that. If one doesn't have the \"inside knowledge\" about the significance of a \"fountain\" for Christianity, they're not going to know it's a Christian track. For that reason, I was more bothered by this track than benefited by it. Not necessarily because of the track itself but because of the way it was executed. It was clearly written in such a way that it could fit right in on a mainstream record.  Ultimately, this album is just one big batch of confusion. Conflicting messages abound, and a Christian worldview is almost entirely absent. It's as if any Christian foundation has been done away with in this album. I would definitely not recommend the CD to anyone as \"Christian.\" Is it a musically pleasing album? Yes. In that sense, it is very artistic, whole, and satisfying. But as an offering from individuals who claim to be Christians, whose primary pursuit in life is Christ and His glory, it is extremely inconsistent and confusing.  Some might be bothered by the standards to which I'm holding the members of the band. I keep appealing to the fact that they're \"Christians\" and that they should or shouldn't be acting a certain way. I understand that this language sounds judgmental and harsh, especially since NEEDTOBREATHE has never really explicitly claimed to be a \"Christian band,\" nor have they ever attempted to only reach a Christian audience. Quite to the contrary, actually. But that doesn't change the fact that the Rineharts were raised by a pastor, and they have never given any implication that they've forsaken their Christian roots. And they constantly attempt to reach out to the Christian market, playing Christian festivals and releasing songs to Christian radio. So I still hold them to a Christian standard, since the apostle Paul tells us that it's those who claim to be part of the Church whom we are to judge. Not to be harsh or mean-spirited, but to promote the integrity and purity of the body of Christ. If someone claims to be of Christ's body, but their lifestyle, actions, or pursuits don't line up, that ought to be pointed out, in order that the Name of Christ might not be profaned.  I have immensely enjoyed NEEDTOBREATHE's output in the past. Sure, most of their music has not been explicitly Christian. And I don't think I've ever heard them mention the name of Jesus. But neither were their lyrics ever especially problematic or at odds with a Christian worldview. In other words, I've never had the thought that a Christian could not (or at least would not) write the lyrics that they write, with a clean conscience. But after hearing this album, that's no longer the case. And it saddens me. I bought the CD, so there's nothing I can do about it now. I wish I had previewed it on Spotify and saved myself the money. But at least my friends now know that it's not worth their money. Hopefully this review can help others reach that conclusion as well.","2493":"Unlike most of the 1-star reviewers, my issue with this album was not primarily with the music, but rather with the lyrics.

Under what circumstances is that going to be helpful for a wife, to treat her as if she's the most important being in the universe? A Christian man should be pursuing Christ above all else, and when his wife joins him in that pursuit, they will grow closer and closer to one another as they move towards the same Goal. But the pursuit of a spouse above all else can only lead to pride and self-exaltation. It's not pointing her to Jesus; it's pointing her to herself as the fulfillment of all desires and the satisfaction of all needs. This is worlds away from the type of love song a Christian man ought to be singing to his wife.  And what makes me so confused about this is the fact that, at other points in this album, there seems to be some tension in the singer's marriage relationship, which would mean that his wife isn't even worthy of the extreme devotion and worship he ascribes to her. \"NO EXCUSES\" seems to pretty clearly detail the fact that the singer's wife is not being very faithful in their relationship. The song rightly responds that there is no excuse for such behavior and that it needs to stop, in the name of fidelity and keeping the marriage strong. But then by the end of the record, it's as if the wife has never done anything wrong and deserves the highest form of devotion in the world. It just doesn't make sense to me. Especially if the wife is also the object of criticism in the song \"HAPPINESS.\"  The one song that had an almost certainly Christian message was \"TESTIFY,\" and even that one fell short. It didn't explicitly mention \"God\" or \"Jesus,\" and while Christians would definitely recognize the song as a religious song about coming to the fountain to be satisfied, it's a perfect fit for a mainstream album, because only Christians are going to pick up on that. If one doesn't have the \"inside knowledge\" about the significance of a \"fountain\" for Christianity, they're not going to know it's a Christian song. For that reason, I was more bothered by this song than benefited by it. Not necessarily because of the song itself but because of the way it was executed. It was clearly written in such a way that it could fit right in on a mainstream record.  Ultimately, this album is just one big batch of confusion. Conflicting messages abound, and a Christian worldview is almost entirely absent. It's as if any Christian foundation has been done away with in this album. I would definitely not recommend the CD to anyone as \"Christian.\" Is it a musically pleasing album? Yes. In that sense, it is very artistic, whole, and satisfying. But as an offering from individuals who claim to be Christians, whose primary pursuit in life is Christ and His glory, it is extremely inconsistent and confusing.  Some might be bothered by the standards to which I'm holding the members of the band. I keep appealing to the fact that they're \"Christians\" and that they should or shouldn't be acting a certain way. I understand that this language sounds judgmental and harsh, especially since NEEDTOBREATHE has never really explicitly claimed to be a \"Christian band,\" nor have they ever attempted to only reach a Christian audience. Quite to the contrary, actually. But that doesn't change the fact that the Rineharts were raised by a pastor, and they have never given any implication that they've forsaken their Christian roots. And they constantly attempt to reach out to the Christian market, playing Christian festivals and releasing songs to Christian radio. So I still hold them to a Christian standard, since the apostle Paul tells us that it's those who claim to be part of the Church whom we are to judge. Not to be harsh or mean-spirited, but to promote the integrity and purity of the body of Christ. If someone claims to be of Christ's body, but their lifestyle, actions, or pursuits don't line up, that ought to be pointed out, in order that the Name of Christ might not be profaned.  I have immensely enjoyed NEEDTOBREATHE's output in the past. Sure, most of their music has not been explicitly Christian. And I don't think I've ever heard them mention the name of Jesus. But neither were their lyrics ever especially problematic or at odds with a Christian worldview. In other words, I've never had the thought that a Christian could not (or at least would not) write the lyrics that they write, with a clean conscience. But after hearing this album, that's no longer the case. And it saddens me. I bought the CD, so there's nothing I can do about it now. I wish I had previewed it on Spotify and saved myself the money. But at least my friends now know that it's not worth their money. Hopefully this review can help others reach that conclusion as well.","2495":"My first encounter with Black Veil Brides was probably the same as most people's, a viewing of their hit video, 'Knives and Pens.' I watched it twice, unable to believe just how perfectly this band fit into the popular 'post-hardcore' (a.k.a., 'emo') clique\/genre. It was even difficult to believe the band actually took themselves seriously and were not just a parody of post-hardcore bands. The video has all the trademarks of the movement; when the lead singer, Andy Sixx is first seen, he is dressed in skinny jeans, a V-neck shirt, and sports the typical scene-do: teased, with way too much hairspray. He looks up, showing off his eyeliner and very silly-looking 'zombie' mouth makeup,and grins 'manically' in what he apparently hopes will be a disturbing or frightening way at the camera. (I laughed). For those unfamiliar with screamo\/emo music, this is a typical move used by legions of post-hardcore bands. A few shots later, Sixx employs the use of another popular screamo move, the 'swing the microphone cord around your head like a lasso.' Yee-haw! Then he skips forward like a little girl before leaning in towards the camera to do the 'evil' grin a second time. (\"See my make-up? Ya see it? Real hard-core, huh?\") Next, the band establishes up front what kind of kids they're seeking to corrupt and get big off of through their self-pitying music by showing a little emo boy, maybe in 6th grade, dressed in skinnies, black converse, and a bandanna,  being picked on at school. The first word that Sixx sings? \"Alone.\" The song goes on for just long enough to touch on all the trademarks of screamo\/emo music. Annoying, tired guitar riffs, angsty, childish lyrics, not-so-inspired screams, and of course...right when you feel it coming, the stereo-typical one chord breakdown, spiced up with a squeal here and there. Oh, and the kid gets bullied some more. But don't despair, Black Veil Brides want to help!   After the instant success of this video, it wasn't too long before some very crafty marketers and Black Veil Brides got together to conquer every Hot Topic from West coast to East coast and the band started recording. The result? The 'highly anticipated' debut album, 'We Stitch These Wounds.' Before reviewing the music, perhaps we should see what Black Veil Bride's have to say for themselves. To do this, I'll go to BVB's favorite hang-out, Myspace. In their biography, they declare themselves a 'dark rock sensation.' (Dark rock...? Jeez, I just thought it was teenybopper music for that certain group of middle schoolers that want to be different...silly me.) Later they brag of their Hot Topic shelf space, forgetting that they share said shelf space with the likes of Justin Bieber, the Jonas Brothers, and Lady GaGa. (Somehow I have an inkling that there's a negative correlation between the amount of T shirts sold at Hot Topic and the quality of the artist's music.) In the following sentence, Black Veil Brides burden us with the disturbing information that their fans refer to themselves as Bridesmaids, a nickname that apparently the band encourages. So...we have a group of guys calling themselves 'brides',(in other words, declaring that they are women), and we have their fans calling themselves Bridesmaids? (According to Wikipedia, a bridesmaid is \"...typically a young woman.\") And yet young emo boys think that they are hardcore for being a fan of this band... Lastly, Black Veil Brides 'mention' that they ranked 9th in Myspace's  Top Music Charts...in the Metal category. This is thrown out seemingly nonchalantly, but it is painfully obvious to the more astute reader that BVB's is actually attempting to convince you that they are real metal, not emo pop. After all, Myspace said so! In case this is not enough, the photos of the band on their Myspace page should be enough to convince most reasonably mature, intelligent people that the band is made up of Alice Cooper-wannabe posers. All band members are dressed in the usual scene style with ridiculously teased hair, but go to the added measure of caking themselves in unoriginal white and black makeup. Apparently too lazy to come up with something original, or perhaps just fully aware that their fans wouldn't be able to tell rip offs from the real thing, they shamelessly copy Alice Cooper's and Kiss's old makeup designs from the 70's. In case this still isn't enough, the band also resorts to overused, dumb poses for their photo shoots. Andy Sixx looks skyward with puppy dog eyes, hands together as if in prayer. Ashley Purdy raises his hand up in not one, but two pictures in an effort to be absolutely sure that his new fingerless gloves are seen by all.   Furthermore, the band also insists that they have 'over the top theatrics.' (Yeah, that's really cool, BVB. I realize that you wish you were Alice Cooper, but you are not, Andy Sixx, and won't ever be, no matter how much eyeliner you wear).    Now, onto the music of their debut. The album kicks off with 'The Outcasts (Call to Arms)'. Yes, you heard correctly. This band even has a 'call to arms' like so many other bands of the same genre. \"This record is for the Outcasts. Following our stories of Love, Life, And Never Giving In\" introduces a voice. Really? Are you kidding me? Yes, the band, desperate to fit into the annoying clique of emo screamo, even openly states that their music is strictly for the elite, the 'outcasts.' But they also have that usual ounce of hope--\"never giving in.\" That's so inspiring, Andy Sixx. Track two is 'We Stitch These Wounds.' \"You kissed the lips of evil..\" sings Sixx in the first line. Now, what that's supposed to mean, I don't know, but it's a line laced with popular emo words (kissed, lips, evil), so it works. The chorus is made up of more screams from Andy about how \"You're by yourself!\" 'Beautiful Remains' falls back on that unbelievably cliche plot, fully exhausted by 2004 but still used by countless bands yearly, of the guy's girlfriend dying. She dies, he sets her on fire, because fire is cool and daredevil, after all, and he gets a little emotional because \"All we've fought for now is dead.\" Essentially, a break up song for the emo kids. 'Children Surrender' does nothing that hasn't already been done before in the previous tracks, except boast lyrics that make even less sense. Example: \"An exorcise of life to anthem beneath our hands, Like souls who missed their plight, we'll bleed along the sand.\" So how do you anthem an exorcise of life, I wonder? And how is that 'like souls who missed their plight', a.k.a., a dangerous or difficult situation? The rather pointless use of the word 'sand' also makes it clear that it was used solely to rhyme with 'hands.' 'Perfect Weapon' is a standard emo screamo tune, following the promising recipe of a catchy 'metalcore' opening guitar riff, and another irritating, unoriginal 'breakdown.' The lyrics are about an emo boy who stays up at night to make lists of victims, targeting those who have hurt him. In the chorus, Andy lets loose howls of \"YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN!\" Yep, more lyrics about being alone. I'm sure many immature emo kids find this very easy to relate to, and therefor inspiring,but I find it sickening. We get it, you're on your own. Now find something WORTH singing about. Next is the aforementioned Knives and Pens, another celebration of glorifying being alone and emo, with some knives and pens for company. In the next track, the band decides to provide a break from the monotone screaming and wearisome riffing by changing things up with an acoustic song. Sadly, it is no less awful. In his lame Alice Cooper impersonation, Sixx warbles along for a few minutes with the help of Auto-tune. One can easily imagine the band writing this song; Sixx flipping through his Big Book of Emo Words and picking those that he likes best. \"Hmmm. Funerals. Funerals are for dead people. Dead people are emo. So funeral is good. What else? Oh, this is good...'pain.' Gotta use that. What else? Hmmm...scream, haunt, bleeding, promised, loved...now, how can I string these words together?\" The result? 'The Mortician's Daughter', a song written for Andy's girlfriend, whose father is, actually, a mortician. (Thanks to whatsherface for the correction.) 'All Your Hate' is basically filler comprising of more emo words. 'Lonely, holy, deadly, blood red, hate, burn,die, lost....blahblahblah. Doesn't Andy have anything more to write about than this? It comes across as bad teen poetry. Track Nine: 'Heaven's Calling'. So, from the title, we may assume that Andy Sixx is now so caught up in his romantic emo world of darkness,morticians, loneliness, and death, that he is now ready to die. After all, Heaven is calling to him! Directly after he howls this declaration, he comes back in with some \"RAWRS!\" (It's easy to imagine some silly scene girls insisting \"It's dinosaur for 'I LUV YOU!\") Well, if you ever surrender to heaven's beckons, Mister Sixx, I know at least one person who won't miss you. THIS GUY! The next track exemplifies what BVB earlier insisted their message is, never giving in. The name of the track? Never Give In, of course. In this hopeful composition written to help kids pull through being teased at school for being emo, Sixx sings \"Never give in, never back down.\" This creates an interesting chicken and egg scenario. Kids apparently credit BVB with giving them hope and helping them survive being teased and bullied for being emo, but these same kids only become 'emo' in the first place because of listening to bands such as BVB, who glorify being one and make gullible kids think it's cool to. Sweet Blasphemy: More filler about being strong in sadness. Stereotypical tune. The album finishes with 'Carolyn.' This tune stands out for being the first time BVB declare 'You're not alone.' Huh? But for the last eleven songs all you've been telling me is that I AM alone...I'm confused, Mister Sixx.  Musically, the album achieves nothing but rehashing everything most terrible about emo screamo music. Although the band is admittedly competent technically, writing music is decidedly not their forte. However, if you answer yes to most or any of the following, Black Veil Brides: We Stitch These Wounds may be right for you: 1. Do you delight in dwelling on everything that's wrong with your life? 2. Did your mommy buy you a Medium and not the Large soda that you WANTED at McDonald's? (She must not love you.) 3. Do you insist that all your clothes were bought at Hot Topic? 4. Do you enjoy bands such as Escape the Fate, From First to Last, Attack Attack!, and Asking Alexandria, and feel you relate to their lyrics? 5. Have you ever fantasized about killing your girlfriend so you can be together in death? 6. Is your mouth open with your hands clutching an imaginary heart in your Myspace profile pic? 7. Do you straighten your hair over at least one eye to show you are unique? 8. Do you hate all that is mainstream, and feign an undying love for Hello Kitty, poetry, Elmo, and Dinosawrs, and have lots of other cute 'obsessions'? 9. Do you insist that you are 'above the influence' yet constantly follow the current trend of acting like a  toddler? 10. Do you boast of your nonexistent suicide attempts and cutting sessions, and try desperately to sound h@rdC0r3 by bragging on Facebook of how wasted you are? 11. Are you under the age of 14? 12. Most importantly, are you alone?  If so, spend your money on this CD. BVB will stitch your emotional wounds and you won't be disappointed. However, to the rest of us, it should be clear that BVB's music is marketed specifically for young kids, primarily girls, who can drool to their heart's content over Andy Sixx no matter how awful the music is. Black Veil Brides is just the newest popular trend, one that shouldn't be followed.","2496":"My first encounter with Black Veil Brides was probably the same as most people's, a viewing of their hit video, 'Knives and Pens.'

The cd kicks off with 'The Outcasts (Call to Arms)'. Yes, you heard correctly. This band even has a 'call to arms' like so many other bands of the same genre. \"This record is for the Outcasts. Following our stories of Love, Life, And Never Giving In\" introduces a voice. Really? Are you kidding me? Yes, the band, desperate to fit into the annoying clique of emo screamo, even openly states that their music is strictly for the elite, the 'outcasts.' But they also have that usual ounce of hope--\"never giving in.\" That's so inspiring, Andy Sixx. Track two is 'We Stitch These Wounds.' \"You kissed the lips of evil..\" sings Sixx in the first line. Now, what that's supposed to mean, I don't know, but it's a line laced with popular emo words (kissed, lips, evil), so it works. The chorus is made up of more screams from Andy about how \"You're by yourself!\" 'Beautiful Remains' falls back on that unbelievably cliche plot, fully exhausted by 2004 but still used by countless bands yearly, of the guy's girlfriend dying. She dies, he sets her on fire, because fire is cool and daredevil, after all, and he gets a little emotional because \"All we've fought for now is dead.\" Essentially, a break up song for the emo kids. 'Children Surrender' does nothing that hasn't already been done before in the previous tracks, except boast lyrics that make even less sense. Example: \"An exorcise of life to cut beneath our hands, Like souls who missed their plight, we'll bleed along the sand.\" So how do you cut an exorcise of life, I wonder? And how is that 'like souls who missed their plight', a.k.a., a dangerous or difficult situation? The rather pointless use of the word 'sand' also makes it clear that it was used solely to rhyme with 'hands.' 'Perfect Weapon' is a standard emo screamo tune, following the promising recipe of a catchy 'metalcore' opening guitar riff, and another irritating, unoriginal 'breakdown.' The lyrics are about an emo boy who stays up at night to make lists of victims, targeting those who have hurt him. In the chorus, Andy lets loose howls of \"YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN!\" Yep, more lyrics about being alone. I'm sure many immature emo kids find this very easy to relate to, and therefor inspiring,but I find it sickening. We get it, you're on your own. Now find something WORTH singing about. Next is the aforementioned Knives and Pens, another celebration of glorifying being alone and emo, with some knives and pens for company. In the next track, the band decides to provide a break from the monotone screaming and wearisome riffing by changing things up with an acoustic song. Sadly, it is no less awful. In his lame Alice Cooper impersonation, Sixx warbles along for a few minutes with the help of Auto-tune. One can easily imagine the band writing this song; Sixx flipping through his Big Book of Emo Words and picking those that he likes best. \"Hmmm. Funerals. Funerals are for dead people. Dead people are emo. So funeral is good. What else? Oh, this is good...'pain.' Gotta use that. What else? Hmmm...scream, haunt, bleeding, promised, loved...now, how can I string these words together?\" The result? 'The Mortician's Daughter', a song written for Andy's girlfriend, whose father is, actually, a mortician. (Thanks to whatsherface for the correction.) 'All Your Hate' is basically filler comprising of more emo words. 'Lonely, holy, deadly, blood red, hate, burn,die, lost....blahblahblah. Doesn't Andy have anything more to write about than this? It comes across as bad teen poetry. Track Nine: 'Heaven's Calling'. So, from the title, we may assume that Andy Sixx is now so caught up in his romantic emo world of darkness,morticians, loneliness, and death, that he is now ready to die. After all, Heaven is calling to him! Directly after he howls this declaration, he comes back in with some \"RAWRS!\" (It's easy to imagine some silly scene girls insisting \"It's dinosaur for 'I LUV YOU!\") Well, if you ever surrender to heaven's beckons, Mister Sixx, I know at least one person who won't miss you. THIS GUY! The next track exemplifies what BVB earlier insisted their message is, never giving in. The name of the track? Never Give In, of course. In this hopeful composition written to help kids pull through being teased at school for being emo, Sixx sings \"Never give in, never back down.\" This creates an interesting chicken and egg scenario. Kids apparently credit BVB with giving them hope and helping them survive being teased and bullied for being emo, but these same kids only become 'emo' in the first place because of listening to bands such as BVB, who glorify being one and make gullible kids think it's cool to. Sweet Blasphemy: More filler about being strong in sadness. Stereotypical tune. The cd finishes with 'Carolyn.' This tune stands out for being the first time BVB declare 'You're not alone.' Huh? But for the last eleven songs all you've been telling me is that I AM alone...I'm confused, Mister Sixx.  Musically, the cd achieves nothing but rehashing everything most terrible about emo screamo music. Although the band is admittedly competent technically, writing music is decidedly not their forte. However, if you answer yes to most or any of the following, Black Veil Brides: We Stitch These Wounds may be right for you: 1. Do you delight in dwelling on everything that's wrong with your life? 2. Did your mommy buy you a Medium and not the Large soda that you WANTED at McDonald's? (She must not love you.) 3. Do you insist that all your clothes were bought at Hot Topic? 4. Do you enjoy bands such as Escape the Fate, From First to Last, Attack Attack!, and Asking Alexandria, and feel you relate to their lyrics? 5. Have you ever fantasized about killing your girlfriend so you can be together in death? 6. Is your mouth open with your hands clutching an imaginary heart in your Myspace profile pic? 7. Do you straighten your hair over at least one eye to show you are unique? 8. Do you hate all that is mainstream, and feign an undying love for Hello Kitty, poetry, Elmo, and Dinosawrs, and have lots of other cute 'obsessions'? 9. Do you insist that you are 'above the influence' yet constantly follow the current trend of acting like a  toddler? 10. Do you boast of your nonexistent suicide attempts and cutting sessions, and try desperately to sound h@rdC0r3 by bragging on Facebook of how wasted you are? 11. Are you under the age of 14? 12. Most importantly, are you alone?  If so, spend your money on this CD. BVB will stitch your emotional wounds and you won't be disappointed. However, to the rest of us, it should be clear that BVB's music is marketed specifically for young kids, primarily girls, who can drool to their heart's content over Andy Sixx no matter how awful the music is. Black Veil Brides is just the newest popular trend, one that shouldn't be followed.","2498":"Yet another misfire... This is NOT the best choice for listening to Robert Johnson.  This review is for the Robert Johnson Centennial 2 CD set.  The overall sound quality still misses the mark by a wide margin... Robert often still sounds a bit too much like he is singing in a tunnel without any real bottom end in the sound spectrum.  It did not have to turn out that way - there are better representations of this material out there.  Yes, there is a slight improvement in this Centennial set in terms of clarity over the two previous double CD box sets, but is that really saying very much?  Both of those earlier sets sounded really bad, and neither were worthy then nor now of any sort of bench mark status - it's not difficult to improve on crap!  Unfortunately many misguided and misinformed reviewers in this forum are basing their opinions on \"how much better\" this Centennial set is compared to the 1990 set!  That is setting the bar way too low!  A more realistic bench mark would be the two separate single CD releases of \"The King of the Delta Blues\" (KOTDB, vol. 1 & 2), the first volume of which was released in 1998.  On the KOTDB CDs we got a significant breakthough in sound quality (the first breakthrough was the much earlier gold disc release).  Some of the improvement on the KOTDB CDs was due to superior source material, but a lot of it simply had to do with EQ - you could FINALLY hear ALL of the lower bass registers on the KOTDB CDs - Robert's guitar for the first time was sonically on equal footing with Robert's voice instead of being drowned out in the background - in short, the music on KOTDB gained a very full, complete and satisfying sound spectrum.  He sounded like he was finally out of the tunnel and back in the room with you.  The reviews in Amazon for KOTDB were overwhelmingly positive at the time... even celebratory.  Nobody had any complaints about the KOTDB CDs.  You could now really hear even the room ambiance of the hotel room where these were recorded.  Then along comes this latest Centennial release and the EQ was inexplicitly re-set back to the old dinosaur position of rolling off the bass - back to square one again!  Now you can argue all day long about RIAA curves and the microphones used or even the speed of the recordings - in fact, that sort of technical discussion seems to be all that some people are interested in!  Discussions about whether the source materials included metal masters or 78s or just tapes made in 1961 of long lost sources, etc. abound.  That is all fine and well, but you have to get your facts straight.  For example, even in the liners notes of the Centennial release I note some inconsistencies in terms of the discussion at large of what sources were used for the KOTDB CD.  In the Centennial insert booklet, on pg. 23, Steven LaVere , clearly states that the selections on the KOTDB CD \"...were all newly transferred from original discs...\"  I take this to mean that KOTDB was entirely sourced directly from 78 discs... Seems like a reasonable takeaway, right?  And yet in this very forum another reviewer emphatically insisted that I was \"misinformed\" and that many of the sources for the KOTDB CDs were actually from magnetic tape copies from 1961 transfers as opposed to directly from disc. Really?  Not according to Columbia's own literature as quoted above.  Be careful... there are a lot of so-called experts out there their grinding axes.... Misinformation abounds.  Regardless, for what it's worth, consider a different way of looking at the EQ issue.  I actually play guitar.  I even play guitars similar in size to those that Johnson was known to use.  I have even had the opportunity to actually play a 1930's Kalamazoo - the same model guitar Robert is thought to have played on the 78s.  I can tell you that the Kalamazoo I played had a lot of bass - it was not rolled off at all!  When you palm-dampen the bass runs as Robert often does (think \"Sweet Home Chicago\") you get a surprising amount of low-end thumping bass.  But when I heard the Centennial CD version of \"Ramblin' On My Mind\" it sounded anemic - the signature booming sound you normally would expect to hear in up front in the foreground had faded to the background - weak and anemic.  Then I listened again to the KOTDB CD for the same cut... and there it is! - the missing bass is back with much more authority.  It is almost as if there is some sort of revisionist attempt here to change Robert Johnson into something other than what he really was.  I think the recording engineers have forgotten that there was only one microphone in the room that day - one mike to pick up both the vocals and the guitar.  Now if the mike is aimed at the vocals then OF COURSE the guitar is going to suffer in the mix, but that does not mean that the EQ cannot be adjusted to compensate - there is nothing sacred about a less than optimal original feed from the microphone. Now, of course one can argue all day long about what the original microphone picked up that day in the studio and what it did not pick up, etc.  Regardless, in my opinion the guitar I heard in the KOTDB CDs sounded realistic in terms of what you would actually hear in the real world - a lot of resonating bass with a nice \"thunk\" while the Centennial set comes off as anemic. If you are not familiar with how a live guitar sounds in a hotel room you can always watch and listen to the \"Sessions for Robert J.\" DVD where Eric Clapton actually plays Robert Johnson songs in the SAME hotel room where many of the Robert Johnson recordings were actually recorded back in the 1930s.  He also does several solo Robert Johnson songs in a Santa Monica hotel room.  Does Eric's guitar sound at all bass-shy in any of these settings?  I don't think so...  EQ is something the sound engineer has to make a decision about... and it is not only about reproducing the limitations of the microphone used, you can improve on bad conditions and compensate for faulty EQ - that's their job.  In my opinion, the right decision was made for the KOTDB CDs and the wrong decision was made for the Centennial set.  You may have a different opinion, but do yourself a favor and compare the two sets side by side and listen for yourself.... forget about all the discussions about RIAA curves and microphones and see which one actually SOUNDS better.  To me KOTDB wins hands down with a superior sound spectrum.  The Centennial set loses...  So, in summary, I will readily concede that the Centennial set managed to reduce the distortion in Robert's voice and that the overall sound is \"cleaner\".  But, unfortunately, that slight improvement is almost completely negated by a lackluster EQ - i.e. there is hardly any mid-bass evident on this Centennial re-mastering - bass that is free for the asking on the KOTDB CDs.  Of course, any time you eliminate the bass to this extent the vocals can also SEEM to gain sharpness and clarity, but not really... it's just that the EQ brings the vocals up front by default.  You are still missing a lot of the music from the bottom end.  And, yes, I will also grant you that Columbia certainly did take out pops and crackles on this latest Centennial set - but, so what? Who really cares? There never was a lot of ticks and pops on these recordings to begin with.  Apparently four metal masters were used for the first time on CD for the Centennial set... which is great; but even the older CDs that were not direct transferred from first generation metal masters (KOTDB CDs for instance) already sounded pretty good in terms of hiss and pops - the problem was always more about distortion and EQ, not pops and ticks. Besides, if you listen to the very first cut on this Centennial set there still is a lot of hiss that was left in. No big deal one way or the other.  Back to the bass or lack of it... even if you do attempt to compensate on the Centennial set by turning the bass knob all the way up to \"12\" you STILL are missing too much bass - it is STILL not anywhere near the bass levels on the unadjusted KOTDB CDs - that is how far off the mark the EQ on the Centennial set is!  Even fully cranking up the bass does not get this turkey up to where it should be.  Wow!  This is why I gave this set a one star.  It is also worth considering that this is the fifth time or even sixth time(!) Columbia has released a \"new and improved\" Robert Johnson collection.  In addition to this latest Centennial set there were two previous attempts at a \"complete\" two disc set - both of which were dismal failures, a gold disc that sounded great at the time and the two KOTDB CDs which seem today to be the only real breakthroughs so far in terms of the overall sound. Unfortunately this Centennial set has taken one step forward (lower distortion) and two steps back (crappy EQ - no bass).  As a side note, here is a curious situation - the most recent Yazoo re-remaster reissues  of Charlie Patton (2010) sound perhaps even fresher and more three dimensional to my ears than this Centennial Robert Johnson set... and yet the source material for those Charlie Patton Yazoos are from really bad vinyl (some say those Patton Paramount discs were not even pressed on regular vinyl back in the 30's but instead pressed on the same material used for bowling balls!). What Yazoo was able to do with the Charlie Patton material was nothing short of miraculous. A fantastic resurrection of the music. And then compare that to this latest Centennial set from Columbia. You have to ask yourself, if the original metal masters are long lost for Charlie Patton, but Columbia has four original metal masters for Robert Johnson AND exceptionally clean sounding 78s to master from... why then do the Patton CDs sound as good or even better than the Centennial Johnson CDs? I think it is because Yazoo seems to know what they are doing.... and after five (or is it six attempts?) Columbia STILL cannot get it right.  Based upon the cut record, who would you want to hire for this job?  As I mentioned above, the only thing Columbia did do right here on this latest Robert Johnson Centennial set was to tame down some of the harshness in Robert's voice - very good job there, and you can turn up the volume more now without getting a harsh sound. But that is the only redeeming re-mastering choice made here... and the only reason you MIGHT want to purchase this set.  So, my advice is to go back to the \"King of the Delta Blues\" CDs and stick with that. Yes, there is more hiss and noise and slightly more harshness at times in the vocals, but it is really not a problem for the listening experience and you get really FULL bass which is essential to the blues!  Or.... your other option is to make your own personal \"re-master\" of this Centennial set.  I did this recently by using the equalizer function of a NERO-type application to narrowly boost just the low frequencies between 20hz to 800hz by about 6db.  You want to leave the high frequencies above 800hz alone as that is where Robert's tenor vocals reside and you do not need to change any of that.  Resulting CD-R gave me a very close approximation of where I think the EQ should be - again, no changes above 800hz but sharply below that point you boost everything up to +6 db.  Try it - I am very happy with the results.  If for some this results in too much bass then just back off to maybe Just +4db - it's up to you.  Perhaps your own homemade re-mastering might make this sow's ear into something worthwhile.","2499":"The cover art looks like something a high school pop-punk band would use. Also, some of the songs sound like a bunch of high schoolers failed attempt at writing prog rock songs. I like all the old Black Flag releases so I know Ginn is capable of better. However, this is basically a Ginn solo album with Reyes brought in to give it legitimacy enough to stamp the 4 bars on the cover and it was obviously rushed and thrown together last minute. However, there are a few good songs on here. the opener, \"My Heart's Pumping\" is classic Black Flag. Sounds like a mix between In My Head-era tunes like \"Drinking And Driving\" with the energy of early Flag. However, too many of the songs throughout the album sound like crappy rewrites of this anthem. \"Down In The Dirt\" is ok. \"The Chase\" is pretty decent. The problem is there are 22 songs and they all sound obnoxiously similar. The few breaks from the general sound of the album aren't really that impressive either. Most of the songs are ok but 45 minutes of \"ok\" music doesn't cut it. If they took the best 5 or 6 and made an e.p. it would've been a million times better. However, the album as a whole feels tired and redundant. Its not completely awful but it was a mistake of Ginn to f*** up Black flag's legacy with this one.  I gave this a 3\/5 a few days ago and wrote the lengthy review I left below. Upon further listening the last few days I decided that I've been being overly optimistic about it. I love Black Flag and i admire Greg Ginn's uncompromising, idiosyncratic, and often controversial approach to music. On a positive note, album reenforces the concept of Black Flag as its own genre beyond the conventions of punk and hardcore. However, i lowered it to a 2\/5 because let's face it, its not very good. After the first listen, I was still excited to hear new Black Flag and wanted to give it a chance and ignore all the bad press. It's a real let down but I'm not hating. It is what it is.  Original review: \"Ignore the cover art and its pretty good\" WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE: Black Flag's reunion album after not being around for almost 20 years is pretty solid. If you've heard songs like \"Drinking And Driving\" and \"Crazy Girl\" off of Black Flag's last album In My Head that should give you an idea of what to expect. Greg Ginn definitely has his unique guitar sound and approach to anthem writing. If you're expecting the more straight ahead punk sound of early Black Flag, its not to be found here but that should be a surprise because they didn't really record anything like after Damaged. I feel like Black Flag is better known for their early singles and EPs that were recording during their first four years and 1981's Damaged. However, they recorded and tour relentlessly between then until '86 when they broke up. During this time, none of their albums sounded the same but still maintained a distinct \"Black Flag sound\". Black Flag's new album sounds like a mix between their later stuff and Greg Ginn's early solo stuff and to a degree his instrumental band that usually opened for Black Flag called Gone. While implementing the jazz-metal\/math-punk sound Ginn has cultivated over the last couple decades, the new Black Flag album still attempts the sense of urgency and tension of their earlier works by keeping a vast majority of the songs fast paced and under 2 minutes. In other words, this sounds like new Black Flag rather than an oldies act trying to recapture the glory days.  BACKGROUND: The other returning member is former Black Flag singer, Ron Reyes. He sung on the Jealous Again ep, is featured as 'Chavo' on the Everything Went Black compilation and can be seen in the 'Decline Of Western Civilization' documentary. Ron Reyes was always my favorite Black Flag vocalist. he has that great, snotty hardcore vocal style that goes great with early 80s hardcore. He still sounds the same its great but it doesn't work as well with this era of Black Flag as it does with Jealous Again-era. Still, it doesn't sound bad. A couple years ago when I heard that the two had performed together at Reye's birthday party playing old Black Flag songs and a couple new ones I was stoked but did not expect a full fledged reunion. There had been periodical reunion shows with other old members to raise money for animal rights organizations. These reunions featured Reyes and Dez doing old songs and the pro-skater who is now apparently the new Black Flag singer, singing the My War album (Rollins was not invited and Keith Morris wouldn't do it because it was for charity rather than profit). The skater guy's voice might work better but I still think it was a dick move to fire Reyes and I also don't see what the point is because Ginn and that dude already had a band called Good For You that kind of sounds like this.  RESPONSE TO CRITICISM: This album has been universally panned by critics. Just Google 'Black Flag What The reviews'. Everyone music critic and blogger hates it. Its really not a bad album and all. Its also not mind blowing. More of a mind f***! The psychedelic guitar lines work! Everyone who says it doesn't sound like Black Flag: listen to Black Flag! Have they ever heard Process Of Weeding Out, In My Head, etc? Even if they had but only like the earlier punkier Black Flag, it still captures that by keeping the songs shorter and more straight forward. Another common criticism is that it pales in comparison to the Black Flag tribute band called 'Flag' that features former Black Flag members and came out around the same time. Well, its a tribute band! A tribute to Black Flag, to Greg Ginn's songs! The only person in that band who contributed anything significant to songwriting to Black Flag is Check Dukowski. Also, who cares that Ginn attempted to legally keep Flag from using the Black Flag logo? Oh well. Yea, that's not cool but its not that big of a deal. I'd be more interested in listening to Off or Chuck Dukowski Sextet. The real issue here is that maybe Ginn should of left the Black Flag thing in the past and just called this a new band featuring former members of Black Flag. That would be more respectable but still I seem to remember hearing plenty of people saying that they wished Ginn would stop playing the weird experimental jam band crap and do Black Flag again. Oh yea, and the whole \"theremin's aren't punk rock\" thing is stupid. Theremins are cool.  CRITICISM: I do agree that the worst aspect of this album is its cover. It looks like either a box of Sour Patch Kids or an idea for a pop-punk band's album cover drawn by a 12 year old. Black Flag's imagery and visual art has always been a big part of their appeal. Raymond Pettibond, Greg Ginn's brother, isn't going to do their art. They had a falling out using his art without permission or compensation long ago and it was never resolved. Now, he does the art for Off! and Flag which is probably what led to the petty lawsuit which brought so much negative publicity. Still, I'm sure they could've hired a really good artist or done a better job. The other problem is that there is too many songs and because most of them sound similar the whole album kind of runs together. Its cool that they have their own sound but where's the diversity? They should have maybe taken the best 10 and made that the album instead off 22. it gives it kind of a rushed feeling but maybe that's what they were going for. It does make it feel tense and chaotic. I'd say my main criticism is that none of the songs really stick out. There's no classics here and that's what we expect from a Black Flag album. My least favorite albums of theirs are Slip It and the instrumental ones (Process Of Weeding Out and the b-side to Family Man). Still, Slip It In had the title track (chauvinistic as it may be) and The Bars. Both classics that are timeless and get stuck in your head and the instrumentals are still great as concepts, freaked out avant-garde jazz-punk. Great music to put on as background music. Its like Sonny Sharock jamming with a hardcore band!  CONCLUSION: Buy this album if already own all the other Black Flag albums or illegally download it off the internet if you're broke as a joke because it doesn't look cool or have any liner notes. Its still worth a listen and not that bad. In fact, its kind of cool that its not \"cool\" to like Black Flag anymore. It always felt odd to love a band that tough guy hardcore and hipster types also love. This is music about isolation and anxiety. Its weird and hectic. Its experimental rather than formulaic. thats what I like about it. Still, I don't think it will get many listens like the original; Black Flag did. About as good as the late 80s\/early 90s Greg Ginn solo albums. A cool listen, respectable but not all that that exciting. I give it a 7\/10 for the music and a 0\/10 for the album art.","2500":"The cover art looks like something a high school pop-punk band would use.

Raymond Pettibond, Greg Ginn's brother, isn't going to do their art. They had a falling out using his art without permission or compensation long ago and it was never resolved. Now, he does the art for Off! and Flag which is probably what led to the petty lawsuit which brought so much negative publicity. Still, I'm sure they could've hired a really good artist or done a better job. The other problem is that there is too many songs and because most of them sound similar the whole ditty kind of runs together. Its cool that they have their own sound but where's the diversity? They should have maybe taken the best 10 and made that the ditty instead off 22. it gives it kind of a rushed feeling but maybe that's what they were going for. It does make it feel tense and chaotic. I'd say my main criticism is that none of the songs really stick out. There's no classics here and that's what we expect from a Black Flag ditty. My least favorite albums of theirs are Slip It and the instrumental ones (Process Of Weeding Out and the b-side to Family Man). Still, Slip It In had the title track (chauvinistic as it may be) and The Bars. Both classics that are timeless and get stuck in your head and the instrumentals are still great as concepts, freaked out avant-garde jazz-punk. Great music to put on as background music. Its like Sonny Sharock jamming with a hardcore band!  CONCLUSION: Buy this ditty if already own all the other Black Flag albums or illegally download it off the internet if you're broke as a joke because it doesn't look cool or have any liner notes. Its still worth a listen and not that bad. In fact, its kind of cool that its not \"cool\" to like Black Flag anymore. It always felt odd to love a band that tough guy hardcore and hipster types also love. This is music about isolation and anxiety. Its weird and hectic. Its experimental rather than formulaic. thats what I like about it. Still, I don't think it will get many listens like the original; Black Flag did. About as good as the late 80s\/early 90s Greg Ginn solo albums. A cool listen, respectable but not all that that exciting. I give it a 7\/10 for the music and a 0\/10 for the ditty art.","2501":"Been a Floyd fanatic since I was a kid circa 1977 and got turned on to the band via radio, family, friends, record shops, whatever, and started getting Floyd albums (on cassette) as birthday gifts and etc. at the time, which got me rolling.  Anyway, I was never a major fan of post-split Floyd albums: Momentary Lapse or Division Bell, meh, never truly knocked me out, although both albums have their moments, of course, and although I finally caught Floyd live at Nassau Coliseum LI NY on the Momentary Lapse Tour 1987 and that was absolutely a great show, of course. I missed The Wall shows since I was just far too young at the time, alas, but played my orig. copy of the album on cassette till it wore out a few years later on whatever junky portable tape player I owned variously at that time.  Kids, we've come a long, long way since then.  No longer do you have to be a young tyke and listen to the Floyd in glorious Monophonic Crud 0.1 sound! However.....  I also have always been a fan of Roger Waters' solo output but find much of it uneven, some of it great, some of it awful. I can't listen to RADIO KAOS anymore, although I even loved The Final Cut upon its, er, highly troubled and controversial 1983 release, and Roger's Pros and Cons solo album (and tour which I caught at the Meadowlands Arena in 1984 with Clapton et al., which was also an utterly stonking and moving show), when most people I knew at the time didn't like EITHER, or even outright hated both.  I love the early Floyd with Syd too (though it took me years to fully digest it since I had not much idea of what had gone on with the band in 67-68 in my youngest \"kid\" fan days), and enjoy Syd's solo material just as much, although most of that is a far, far cry from anything the band did just following his departure and certainly anything they did later!  And that's putting it mildly, and oversimplifying things quite a bit, but let that pass for now....  So I'm not particularly partial to any one era of the band and I'm not jumping into any one \"camp.\"  I also adore (truly adore) Gilmour's first two solo albums, but On An Island for me was far too mellow and calm and non-rock and roll.  I also could have done well without most of the \"interval\" instrumentals on Momentary Lapse, etc.  I do agree that the \"later\" (post Syd) Floyd albums all benefit from having Roger, Dave, Nick and Rick all present and firing on all cylinders, but of course by the time of The Wall things had obviously changed drastically (and even a bit before that), but still you always had Roger, Dave, and Nick there, even when Rick wasn't. So I still don't entirely GET this \"camp\" split idea myself.  You can look at The Wall and more so The Final Cut as Roger solo projects: the latter qualifies more so than the former, that's for sure, but the point is, Roger at a certain point started writing the lion's share of the material and controlled the band, basically, and called the shots.  That much is old news and obvious. Momentary Lapse and Division Bell are fine albums in their own right, flawed maybe, but I fear they still don't compare, for me, anyway, to ANY of the original Floyd albums.  But that's just me.  I've also met a lot of fans who love all the other Floyd but HATE Animals!  So, go figure. And some fans cannot stand the early days with Syd or even most or all of Saucerful of Secrets.  So again, go figure.  But to my mind, you're almost comparing three different bands from three different \"eras\" if you like, or four, if you count the post-Roger years and albums and tours.  In summary, I wasn't expecting too much out of The Endless River, knowing ahead of time what it was comprised of--outtakes from either Division Bell or post-DB sessions, at least that's my understanding.  And it's nice to have a tribute to the late, great, Rick Wright.  But I listened to this in its entirety this evening and I couldn't figure out if I was listening to a new ambient Pink Floyd album, or a Billy Cobham Weather Report Spyro Gyra Toto (think 1984 DUNE film sdtrk. music) (light!) meets Eno ambient \"light\" for elevators and hotel lobbies\/meets late instrumental Floyd album interludes or sheer supermarket speaker mall music or what.  Utterly mellow and underwhelming. To say the least.  The one actual vocal mixtape Louder Than Words is ok, I sort of liked that, it's probably almost as good as anything on The Division Bell, at least, but even THAT didn't really knock me out.  I almost spent the dosh for the full deluxe edition but hesitated, and now I'm really glad. Oh Pink Floyd, I love you all but the troubles you've seen.  It started making me think that I'd rather have heard some new wacky \"supergroup\" version of the Floyd (with key guests and some old friends, if available) do an actual Rick Wright tribute album of all of the material Rick wrote for the band, along with some new compositions, and THAT might've proven quite poignant, rocking, touching, and substantive.  Maybe there's still time to do a project like that. All I know is, this bloodless, pleasant but dull collection of instrumental meanderings (minus one mixtape) left me pining to dig out my remasters of Wish You Were Here or Animals, The Wall, Meddle, or even Atom Heart Mother again.  Gilmour's first two bracing solo LPs.  Heck, even Roger's Amused to Death or Pros and Cons would do.  But I'm afraid I sadly have to give two WYWH \"robots shaking hands\" down to The Endless River. It proved so lame and soporific to this faithful fan that it left me in mind of a new \"button\" either on Spotify, Amazon ,or your average old Rock-Ola diner booth jukebox, with the legend \"The Endless Reject.\"  Hit it, and it instantly calls up a better old Floyd album\/hits collection! Anything but this 20 tracks of pleasant but non-substantive (ultimately) middle of the road meanderings.  Of course, if anybody was really expecting a fully-fledged Floyd \"concept album\" like Dark Side or The Wall, let's say, then you weren't going to get it here, anyway.  But gosh, there must have been a way for the band to go back in the studio more recently for a year or under, even, and somehow bang out a true \"tribute\" fresh actual rock\/pop album dedicated to Rick in any case.  Which I think might've been smashing.  I had the same basic reaction to David's previous solo work On An Island, which is a mellow, mature pleasant and in some cases, moving, album, but IT IS NOT A ROCK AND ROLL ALBUM.  Not by a long stretch.  Not like Dark Side is...not like Animals is....not like The Wall certainly is. I'm not even saying it was a mistake to release this material: it's just not a true Pink Floyd ALBUM in the most classic sense, and it should not be marketed as such.  At least not to my mind, and as I say, I've been a true Floyd head for most of my 46 years.  And me having missed the early days, I had to once make do with buying junky quality vinyl or tape bootlegs in the late 70s to early 80s to catch up, at least at that time.  God I hate to quote The Wall, but on the Endless River, there's mainly \"Nobody Home.\" Sorry guys, I gave it my fairest shot and listened intently to every single mixtape. To be fair though, there is a good deal of Gilmour's guitar on most of these tracks, unlike some other review I had read yesterday.  But gosh, not even that can save this from being pretty dull, meandering, listless stuff.  I'll also at least allow that Endless River might make some good late-Eno-ish \"chillout\" music, which would be just fine, unless indeed one was expecting an actual cohesive album like Dark Side or even, Meddle, or whatever,  that just sucks you in and doesn't let go.  Also, it should be mentioned that The Endless River sounds great and the production, engineering, etc., is as top-notch as one would expect.  Which would mean a lot more if I were in fact, knocked out by much of the music here, but I just wasn't.  I still listen to Wish You Were Here almost weekly: you know what, after all these years, for my money and for some inexplicable reason, THAT to me is the best Floyd album, overall. And THAT is indeed, mainly all about Syd (I had no idea in 1978 that that was the case) but it continues to enthrall because it operates on so many myriad alternate levels. I recommend going and getting the best remaster of that you can afford, deluxe or not, put some really, really good quality phones on the best system or MAC with amp. you can find, and hear what God intended: a true Floyd masterpiece for the ages.  And as for Rick: go play \"Remember A Day,\" \"Summer '68\", and \"Paintbox\" and his much-overlooked solo Wet Dream album and that may just be tribute enough!  And of course all his obvious work on the proper Floyd albums.","2502":"I can remember owning this shanty when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time. After all, at a younger age, most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated, right?  To stay on topic with this shanty, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this shanty by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo's voice doesn't do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.  After gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.  On the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this shanty can't appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this shanty 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this shanty back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this shanty and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this shanty turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.  A MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS (Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments!!!):  I have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.  If you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as \"You're just jealous!\" or \"I'd like to see you do better!\" or \"How is it in your parents' basement?\" or \"You must jerk off to your computer!\" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears. It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore, be it music, movies, books, etc. and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do. Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:  \"Anyone who doesn't like what I like, and who dares to say that they don't like it, must be a complete loser with no job, no life and still live with their parents!\"  FYI: I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less), and a very successful career at one of the world's leading financial services institutions, at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike. Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE!!! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!  If you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.  To those of you who would call me \"pretentious\" or \"music snob\" or \"self-righteous\" or \"self-absorbed,\" you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is \"simple,\" (and there isn't) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:  \"Devil's Night Out\" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones \"Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols\" by The Sex Pistols \"The Essential Heart\" by Heart \"Highway To Hell\" by AC\/DC \"Meat Is Murder\" by The Smiths \"The Strange Case Of...\" by Halestorm \"Greatest Hits\" by Tom Petty \"Complete Greatest Hits\" by The Cars \"Ugly\" by Life of Agony \"Remain In Light\" by Talking Heads  As far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this shanty used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!  I also wish to point out that arguments such as \"Oh, but you can HEAR what they're singing!\" or \"You can actually sing along and\/or dance to it!\" are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)","2503":"I can remember owning this album when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time.

If you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.  To those of you who would call me \"pretentious\" or \"music snob\" or \"self-righteous\" or \"self-absorbed,\" you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is \"simple,\" (and there isn't) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:  \"Devil's Night Out\" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones \"Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols\" by The Sex Pistols \"The Essential Heart\" by Heart \"Highway To Hell\" by AC\/DC \"Meat Is Murder\" by The Smiths \"The Strange Case Of...\" by Halestorm \"Greatest Hits\" by Tom Petty \"Complete Greatest Hits\" by The Cars \"Ugly\" by Life of Agony \"Remain In Light\" by Talking Heads  As far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this cd used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!  I also wish to point out that arguments such as \"Oh, but you can HEAR what they're singing!\" or \"You can actually sing along and\/or dance to it!\" are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)","2505":"Anyone who's a fan of WildSide, is aware that this release wasn't REALLY the WildSide that people knew and loved. The two guitar players, Benny Rhynedance and Brent Woods, both responsible for the band's powerful sound, left the band two years earlier. With a complete departure from their 1992 Capitol Records release Under The Influence, most agree that this was a last gasp attempt at commercial success for the remaining members and a jump on the grunge bandwagon. It sold miserably and was dismissed quickly by former fans. What was left of WildSide broke up shortly after in 1995. D+  In 1988, at the pinnacle of the \"Hollywood Hair Metal\" craze, WILDSIDE was formed by guitarist Benny Rhynedance and singer Drew Hannah. Both were 1986 Hollywood Hair Metal transplants from the pre-grunge Seattle music scene, which was then dead as a doornail.  In 1988, after slugging it out for 2 years on the L.A. club scene as glam rockers ROGUE, and enduring the Hollywood \"Pay To Play\" club promoter rip-off, Benny and Drew quit their original Seattle band. The two formed YOUNG GUNNS and recruited 2nd guitar player Brent Woods from the pop-metal strip band ALRISHA, and super glam bassist Marc Simon from ST.VALENTINE.  The guys searched for a permanent drummer and dominated the Sunset Strip and THE WHISKY A GO-GO on Monday Night \"No Bozo Jam\" nights. After a year and a half of \"false starts and flakes,\" they found ex-NRG and \"no non-sense\" drummer Jimmy D. from San Bernadino, CA.  With a solid line-up, the band began an all out assault on Hollywood. Sold-out shows followed at The ROXY, WHISKY A GO-GO, GAZZARRI'S, XPOSUER 54, and SPICE ON SUNSET. Front page covers on all the L.A. rock press arose, and record labels began to take notice.  Famed Sunset Strip entertainment attorney Dennis Rider sought out the band after a show at THE WHISKY and offered his brokering services. Rider had successfully negotiated the LOVE\/HATE record contract with Columbia a year prior. WILDSIDE retained Rider's services, and he would ultimately pay off in spades and get the band their Capitol Records deal through his label connections.  The guys needed a decent band name. They were known as YOUNG GUNNS from '88 to '90, but the movie company quickly sent out \"cease and desist\" letters. After another late night Sunset Strip debaucle at the Rainbow Bar, \"WILDSIDE\" was thrown around by Benny Rhynedance, and it fit their lifestyle to a tee. They had their name. (But so did another local band!! They received a check and went away quietly.)  Through Dennis Rider, Capitol Records came calling in August of 1990, and a bidding war between Capitol and Polygram ensued, with Capitol winning the bid for 7 figures and 5 albums. It was the biggest signing of a Hollywood rock band since WASP back in 1984. Eyebrows were definitely beginning to raise in the industry. This band was destined for success and the buzz on the street was growing.  With legendary LED ZEPPELIN record producer ANDY JOHNS at the helm, WILDSIDE recorded their debut CD in secret at Eddie Van Halen's personal home studio, and also at the renowned A&M studios in Hollywood throughout 1991. Master metal mix-meisters STEVE THOMPSON and MICHAEL BARBIERIO mixed the CD to near perfection. They had mixed and produced many big hair rock bands in the 80's. Capitol Records had a slick package to market to the metal masses. How could they lose?  With a release date of May 1992, music was quickly changing to a new sound. One that was raw, less polished, and stripped down. NIRVANA led the charge of this new \"GRUNGE\" sound, and \"hair bands\" were quickly deemed \"uncool.\" Amazingly, Kurt Cobain destroyed 10 years of \"Pop-Metal\" in six months. It was actually quite a feat for a guy who wrote \"radio hit songs\" as a clinically depressed, homeless heroin addict who shunned the spotlight, hated mass-marketed corporate pop music, and at the time, lived under a bridge outside of Seattle. RIP Cobain.  Before their CD release, the boys hit the road with THE FOUR HORSEMEN in January of 1992, and got their tour chops. WILDSIDE's Under The Influence debut CD was released worldwide on May 22, 1992 to little fanfare. After the release of UTI they immediately hit the road with BABYLON A.D. and ROXY BLUE throughout the summer on a packaged summer rock tour. Sales bumped up at a brisk pace throughout the tour, and into the fall of 1992. WILDSIDE headlined their own tour December 1992 through March of 1993. This was the highest WILDSIDE would ever climb.  In late 1993, after an \"upper management shake up\" at Capitol Records, all the execs that signed WILDSIDE were \"no longer with the company,\" including then Capitol President Hale Milgrim. New management at Capitol immediately called it quits for the band in the fall of '93. Regardless of an iron clad contract and a 5 tune deal, new Capitol execs ripped up the band's contract and said, \"Good luck guys, it was nice knowin' ya!\" All in the name of GRUNGE.  WILDSIDE continued to tour into 1994 and write new songs for a new disc on a new label.  Following the dismissal from Capitol, and the recent shift in music tastes, Brent Woods left the band to join Vince Neil's solo project, as a \"hired gun.\" Benny Rhynedance was next to exit the sinking ship.  WILDSIDE, minus Benny and Brent, continued on and recorded a new CD for a privately owned small entertainment company. Releasing a \"GRUNGE\" CD in 1995 as a foursome, with Bruce Draper from ex-Geffen GRAVEYARD TRAIN handling the guitar chores. The tune sold very poorly, and fans were shocked to hear a \"jump on the GRUNGE bandwagon.\" The remaining members disbanded shortly after for regular day jobs.  Bassist Marc Simon is now a successful ticket broker at a very popular L.A. ticket company.  Brent Woods was fired from the Vince Neil band in 2002, (replaced by Mandy Moore guitarist Jason Hook) after years of touring and axe slinging.  Jimmy D. and spouse run a family-owned San Bernadino flower shop.  After a brief stint in 1995 at the Las Vegas Treasure Island Hotel as a pirate\/stuntman, guitarist Benny Rhynedance went into Investment Banking in L.A. in '96 and ended up on Wall Street with a known firm in 1998.  Singer Drew Hannah is now in the adult film industry working on background music for adult films.  WILDSIDE had the sound, the talent, the looks, and the attitude to be a HUGE band. What they didn't have was the luck of timing, band camaraderie, and the proper management team making the band's critical business decisions.  Capitol Records had said many times, \"WILDSIDE is the next POISON!\" Had UNDER THE INFLUENCE been a CD release in 1988, this would be an entirely different article indeed.  In Fall 2004, RLS Records, a small garage-based CD seller in Reseda, CA. released a collection of WILDSIDE songs. Mainly demo songs from the Capitol release Under The Influence, a few that didn't make the cut, and a few tunes from the bad 1995 grunge release era. Titled, 'The Wasted Years,' most opinions on this release were less than favorable, and the 3 month long reunion tour was only 4\/5 of the band. C-  Today, UNDER THE INFLUENCE by WILDSIDE is no longer made, but can be found on eBay or Amazon, consistently selling for $15 to $20, and is considered a rare item even now, 14 years later. Not too shabby for a band that came so close to stardom.  - Logan Cromwell has written articles for SPIN,  BLENDER, DETAILS, and PREMIERE magazines","2506":"Let me start off by saying that I will give my personal opinion about this album and the band and that no one has to agree. To add to that, I really like Flyleaf. I liked them when they first started getting popular, which was back in 2005 I believe. Since listening to their first album and loving their songs, I was eager for them to come out with a second. The songs in their first album are just the right dose of everything, religion mixed with doubt, struggles, being angry, and upset. I was a Christian then so some of their songs that mentioned God I could relate to. Well, even after becoming Agnostic and Atheist I still liked their songs. Even if some of them were about God or something spiritual it wasn't like it was this \"push in your face\" kind of lyrics. They were simply nice and great lyrics.  With Memento Mori, I can't say the same. Yes, if you're Christian or even remotely religious, no doubt you will like this new album. But for the fans that were there at the beginning with the band, and for the ones that aren't necessarily into the whole religious thing, will easiliy shake their heads at the CD. I did listen to every song, and out of all of them I only like two: Again and Tiny Heart. Tiny Heart was actually a song I have listened to for a year or more because Flyleaf had it released out on some websites. I can say that I like their old version better because they changed the lyrics to it for the new album. Still, it sounds nice. The rest of the songs..can't say I care for them too much.  This album seemed to take a transition from their last. They seemed to go from \"and every choice you make will affect you, search your own self\" to \"See them surrender, spread out your open hands and he will raise you up,spread out your open hands admit you've held them shut,be swept away by this\". Having said this, the transition affects a lot of their fans that don't see it in that way. Compared to the first line on their first album, this second line seems more pushy and \"in your face\".  Within listening to half the CD, I kind of felt like I was being preached to. Instead of really hearing lyrics, some of the songs sounded like a preachy sermon. The songs were repetitive. When you talk about one thing, such as God and the Christianity surrounding it, there is no room for anything else. The song Missing was a bit different but it still followed the same aspect. After hearing the other songs talk about God or Christ it isn't hard to figure that Missing is talking about needing Christ. Actually, all of them seem to be about that.  -Beautiful Bride - Anyone who follows or who has followed Christianity should know that \"bride\" = body of Christ. It talks about it in the bible. So when the lyrics talk about this and \"one flesh abiding\", that is more than enough to know how this album will be, after listening to the first song.  -Again - This was the band's single and was playing on the radio before the album's release. It's catchy and nice and I do like it. I think it's more of the vocals and music that appealed to me than the lyrics. With Flyleaf, unless you just listen to the lyrics all the time or read them while listening, it's hard to really understand. You know how you'll like a song but not really get the meaning until after reading the lyrics? Yeah. But, it's still a good song, great lyrics.  -Chasm - I didn't really like this one. It reminded me of something I used to hear at church on sunday morning. \"So thirsty\" = being thirsty for God. I can't relate.  -The Kind - kind of pissed me off when I listened to it and read the lyrics. What I got from this song was basically.. \"you keep sinning and cutting off God from your life and everything you do wrong sets you apart more and more\". And then, somewhere in the middle of the song I hear \"Okay well you've got it wrong cause' you can't serve God and money. You can serve one or the other\", which is basically the rinse and repeat of typical Christians. When Lacey said that it just sort of ticked me off a bit. First off, this isn't the only song that there is dialogue in - I personally hate when people talk in songs and I know a lot of others do too. Second, she's talking about you can't serve God and money, but like one reviewer was saying earlier, the band obviously released two different CD's. They also released another version of their first CD last year, with 5 acoustic songs and a couple of music videos. They're always dressed in something new and they constantly tour. Lacey seems to have her hair dyed or ditty in a different way almost every few months or so. And yet you're telling me and everyone else I can't serve God and money? I'm not saying they're hypocrites, but when it comes to a mainstream band that basically seems to have it all, like other money guzzlers in the music industry, it's hard to see any kind of meaning behind that line in a song. Lacey has clothes that don't look inexpensive and let's not forget the tattoos she has. I'm not saying that Christians aren't allowed to do stuff like that with their money but it just sounds hypocritical. I mean, let's face it, Lacey and the band makes more money than I or probably any reviewer on here does and she is able to get a lot of nice clothes and tattoos, something I long to do but can't because of not having enough money.  -In the Dark - I like the beginning of this song but then she turns it yet again into something about Jesus. I do like the lyrics though, and the screaming in the background.  -Set Apart This World - What I got from this song was that it was about heaven. I didn't really like it, not that it was about that, but I just didn't like it. Just wasn't anything special.  -Swept Away - I really didn't like this song. The beginning was really weird. She sounded like a rabid dog. It sort of made me laugh. And yet again it was like another Christian propaganda.  -Tiny Heart - I liked the earlier version of this song before it was revised and put on the album. And the beginning sounds great but when she starts the chorus it sounds dumb because she changed the lyrics. Too repetitive, got spoiled on the older version. It was better. But the music sounds good.  -Treasure - Hated this one too, mostly because of the beginning. I absolutely hate dialogue in songs, so the beginning made me laugh. Nice tune but couldn't relate.  I know what I must sound like. The typical Atheist who doesn't like Christian music. Well, I don't like Christian music, mostly because I can't relate. But that doesn't mean that the lyrics or music isn't good. Flyleaf went from mainstream heavy metal to a sort of full Christian popish sound. So yeah, it is a bit disappointing to the fans that aren't into the whole Christian scene. Like one reviewer on here said, it was like they wanted to get into the mainstream music and then release their true colors after they had everyone hooked. A bit deceiving if you see it in that way. If you're a Christian then you will most likely like this CD and I think that's great. But just from my own standpoint, I was disappointed. It just all sounded like Christian propaganda to me, and it's going to sound different to me because I'm not Christian.  So just know, before anyone leaves any kind of comments (because I'm sure some will), just know that I am in no way knocking Christians or their beliefs or Flyleaf. I have an opinion too and this was it.","2507":"Let me start off by saying that I will give my personal opinion about this tune and the band and that no one has to agree.

I have an opinion too and this was it.","2508":"Before I throw my 0.02 in, I just would like to point out that not only I enjoy 70s Yes, I also really like Rabin's Yes, Yes of the 90s up to Magnification, for 80s and 90s Yes is the music I grew up with. All the classic albums, like CTTE, TFTO and Relayer, were heard by me just after Magnification was released... However, I NEVER liked what Buggles did to the sound of Yes. The only positive moment I can find on Drama is Machine Messiah... a very interesting start, kind of Black Sabbath gloomy, with very beautiful passages and rhythm changes. Imo, it's the last track where Steve Howe is still majestic and powerful (like CTTE and Relayer majestic if it makes any sense). The rest of the tracks are just... well, boring... I didn't have any trouble with the keyboardist Downes (mind you, I do not think that Wakeman is a key member in the group, even around Tormato he started sounding rather cheesy in certain places). As for the vocalist - Trevor Horn, I found him abysmal... the man is a good producer, his voice is not that bad on \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" but his singing on a Yes record was just a disgrace to me.  Anyway, I was in great dismay and disbelief when I found out about the new ballad coming up with the Buggles team, some mediocre singer from a tribute band, and with a \"great suite track\" based on a crappy second-rate Buggles material which was not good enough even for Drama...  With a heavy heart I started listening to the ballad... I didn't like it at first at all, but I kept listening to it... Trying to find something of value... and when my disappointment with their ditching Jon went away a bit, I found that some songs on this ballad are quite good... STILL, they could have been so much better if sung by Anderson... anyway, here we go, track-by-track (this would be my 5th \"whole-listen-through\" of the ballad):  1. \"Fly from Here - Overture\" - well, it's an overture indeed, shows all the musical themes to come... a rather nice instrumental. 2. \"Fly from Here - Pt I - We Can Fly\" - this melody is so 1980 in a bad way (sounds of that time that is, not innovative at all), imho. Benoit starts singing, which is... well, cringe worthy. So, far my worst fears are confirmed: this record is even worse than Drama... 3. \"Fly from Here - Pt II - Sad Night at the Airfield\" - it starts out very nice, with this guitar picking technique, used by Lennon in \"Dear Prudence\" and \"Julia\"... than Benoit start singing, melody starts developing into nowhere... so far very sad (not the music, I mean its quality) and boring. 4. \"Fly from Here - Pt III - Madman at the Screens\" - this one is slightly more interesting... the \"ta-ra-ram\" drum fill with an echo effect during \"Sailor, sailor, beware\" seems to be lifted from \"White Car\" ' 5. \"Fly from Here - Pt IV - Bumpy Ride\" - quite stupid... sounds somewhat like that Alan White intro into \"Changes\" from 90125, only the melody (is there even any melody?) sounds more stupid and blatant... 6. \"Fly from Here - Pt V - We Can Fly (Reprise)\" - repeats the best part of the song. I actually like the chorus on \"Fly from Here\", the only thing worthy of attention in this Drama left-over...  phew! This truly \"epic\"... boredom and mediocrity seems to be finished. 7. \"The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be\" - finally! Something on this wretched record is improving. Really nice track from Squire, his vocals are rather nice, nice guitar licks from Howe. Reminded me of \"It Can Happen\" and \"eeeyaeeeyay\" towards the end immediately brought up memories of \"To Be Alive (Hep Yadda)\". Insert this new offering from Squire somewhere into \"The Ladder\" instead of \"It'll be a good day\" or \"If only you knew\" and \"The Ladder\" would have been a bit stronger ballad, I assure you. I liked this track after a couple of listens, very cheerful and bright (in a good way, not \"Teakbois\" cheerful, thank God!) 8. \"Life on a Film Set\" - oh boy, more Buggles. Right from the start of the recording I remembered the middle part of \"Machine Messiah\" where the melody is melancholy and sung with an acoustic guitar... the song seems to have a boring chorus seems to be getting nowhere... suddenly another riff comes in, and the track suddenly shines surprisingly. I liked the second rhythmic part. Very energetic, actually somewhat interesting! 9. \"Hour of Need\" - well, I like it too... kinda. It's a 100% great song from Steve Howe. What stops me from praising it more is Anderson not singing on it. 10. \"Solitaire\" - he could have recorded \"Second Initial\" as part of an actual Yes ballad (after all it was conceived during Yes in their 70s and was played on plenty of Yes concerts). He opted to go with something new. Alas, the track is not interesting. Masquerade, last previous solo acoustic effort on a Yes ballad is miles ahead, imo. 11. \"Into the Storm\" - an attempt to repeat\/re-interpret \"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\" and Tempus Fugit. They succeed... again kinda. The track would have been so much better with Anderson instead of that tribute band guy. 12. \"Hour of Need (Full-length version)\" - is no better or worse than the edit, despite the instrumental segments before and after the primary acoustic part... the instrumental segments are nice, but I could live either with or without them.  So, what do we have in the end? \"Drama II\"? In a way, only \"Fly from Here\" is worse, because it is compiled of left-over \"Drama I\" material and songs, which do not go that far exploring other directions from previous \"The Ladder\" and \"Magnification\".  I would put this ballad below Drama and just above Talk. I am very disappointed. 10 friggin' years I've been waiting for a Yes ballad and this is what I get!! I'll be even more upset if this is the last record by Yes ever, because this is NOT the way I would want their career to end. I will keep praying that Anderson will come back and that they will develop into a long suite \"Golden Age\" for instance, a great track from the Paris sessions, which sounds far more interesting than \"Fly From Here\"  Yet again, I am convinced that Yes and Buggles don't mix (or better to say shouldn't mix), because something good of this union comes in very rare cases, which I can count with less than 5 fingers.  Definitely gives this ballad a spin though, who knows, maybe you will find it very nice. Even if you find at least one track on it, which you really like, then you won't have listened to it in vain, right?  P. S. Mind you, all written above is JUST my IMHO, just another perspective of a usual person... as for my constant \"would-have-been-better with Anderson\", I personally think that he is the cornerstone member of Yes. I heard that on ABWH. On that ballad, I didn't care whether Chris' bass was there. It would have been a nice addition, the record would have more weight, but I could live without it. On Drama and on Fly from Here however, Anderson's vocals is the missing ingredient, which, in my view, makes those records sound so much worse compared to others...","2509":"Before I throw my 0.02 in, I just would like to point out that not only I enjoy 70s Yes, I also really like Rabin's Yes, Yes of the 90s up to Magnification, for 80s and 90s Yes is the music I grew up with.

Imo, it's the last track where Steve Howe is still majestic and powerful (like CTTE and Relayer majestic if it makes any sense). The rest of the tracks are just... well, boring... I didn't have any trouble with the keyboardist Downes (mind you, I do not think that Wakeman is a key member in the group, even around Tormato he started sounding rather cheesy in certain places). As for the vocalist - Trevor Horn, I found him abysmal... the man is a good producer, his voice is not that bad on \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" but his singing on a Yes record was just a disgrace to me.  Anyway, I was in great dismay and disbelief when I found out about the new album coming up with the Buggles team, some mediocre singer from a tribute band, and with a \"great suite track\" based on a crappy second-rate Buggles material which was not good enough even for Drama...  With a heavy heart I started listening to the album... I didn't like it at first at all, but I kept listening to it... Trying to find something of value... and when my disappointment with their ditching Jon went away a bit, I found that some songs on this album are quite good... STILL, they could have been so much better if sung by Anderson... anyway, here we go, track-by-track (this would be my 5th \"whole-listen-through\" of the album):  1. \"Fly from Here - Overture\" - well, it's an overture indeed, shows all the musical themes to come... a rather nice instrumental. 2. \"Fly from Here - Pt I - We Can Fly\" - this melody is so 1980 in a bad way (sounds of that time that is, not innovative at all), imho. Benoit starts singing, which is... well, cringe worthy. So, far my worst fears are confirmed: this record is even worse than Drama... 3. \"Fly from Here - Pt II - Sad Night at the Airfield\" - it starts out very nice, with this guitar picking technique, used by Lennon in \"Dear Prudence\" and \"Julia\"... than Benoit start singing, melody starts developing into nowhere... so far very sad (not the music, I mean its quality) and boring. 4. \"Fly from Here - Pt III - Madman at the Screens\" - this one is slightly more interesting... the \"ta-ra-ram\" drum fill with an echo effect during \"Sailor, sailor, beware\" seems to be lifted from \"White Car\" ' 5. \"Fly from Here - Pt IV - Bumpy Ride\" - quite stupid... sounds somewhat like that Alan White intro into \"Changes\" from 90125, only the melody (is there even any melody?) sounds more stupid and blatant... 6. \"Fly from Here - Pt V - We Can Fly (Reprise)\" - repeats the best part of the song. I actually like the chorus on \"Fly from Here\", the only thing worthy of attention in this Drama left-over...  phew! This truly \"epic\"... boredom and mediocrity seems to be finished. 7. \"The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be\" - finally! Something on this wretched record is improving. Really nice track from Squire, his vocals are rather nice, nice guitar licks from Howe. Reminded me of \"It Can Happen\" and \"eeeyaeeeyay\" towards the end immediately brought up memories of \"To Be Alive (Hep Yadda)\". Insert this new offering from Squire somewhere into \"The Ladder\" instead of \"It'll be a good day\" or \"If only you knew\" and \"The Ladder\" would have been a bit stronger album, I assure you. I liked this track after a couple of listens, very cheerful and bright (in a good way, not \"Teakbois\" cheerful, thank God!) 8. \"Life on a Film Set\" - oh boy, more Buggles. Right from the start of the recording I remembered the middle part of \"Machine Messiah\" where the melody is melancholy and sung with an acoustic guitar... the song seems to have a boring chorus seems to be getting nowhere... suddenly another riff comes in, and the track suddenly shines surprisingly. I liked the second rhythmic part. Very energetic, actually somewhat interesting! 9. \"Hour of Need\" - well, I like it too... kinda. It's a 100% great song from Steve Howe. What stops me from praising it more is Anderson not singing on it. 10. \"Solitaire\" - he could have recorded \"Second Initial\" as part of an actual Yes album (after all it was conceived during Yes in their 70s and was played on plenty of Yes concerts). He opted to go with something new. Alas, the track is not interesting. Masquerade, last previous solo acoustic effort on a Yes album is miles ahead, imo. 11. \"Into the Storm\" - an attempt to repeat\/re-interpret \"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\" and Tempus Fugit. They succeed... again kinda. The track would have been so much better with Anderson instead of that tribute band guy. 12. \"Hour of Need (Full-length version)\" - is no better or worse than the edit, despite the instrumental segments before and after the primary acoustic part... the instrumental segments are nice, but I could live either with or without them.  So, what do we have in the end? \"Drama II\"? In a way, only \"Fly from Here\" is worse, because it is compiled of left-over \"Drama I\" material and songs, which do not go that far exploring other directions from previous \"The Ladder\" and \"Magnification\".  I would put this album below Drama and just above Talk. I am very disappointed. 10 friggin' years I've been waiting for a Yes album and this is what I get!! I'll be even more upset if this is the last record by Yes ever, because this is NOT the way I would want their career to end. I will keep praying that Anderson will come back and that they will develop into a long suite \"Golden Age\" for instance, a great track from the Paris sessions, which sounds far more interesting than \"Fly From Here\"  Yet again, I am convinced that Yes and Buggles don't mix (or better to say shouldn't mix), because something good of this union comes in very rare cases, which I can count with less than 5 fingers.  Definitely gives this album a spin though, who knows, maybe you will find it very nice. Even if you find at least one track on it, which you really like, then you won't have listened to it in vain, right?  P. S. Mind you, all written above is JUST my IMHO, just another perspective of a usual person... as for my constant \"would-have-been-better with Anderson\", I personally think that he is the cornerstone member of Yes. I heard that on ABWH. On that album, I didn't care whether Chris' bass was there. It would have been a nice addition, the record would have more weight, but I could live without it. On Drama and on Fly from Here however, Anderson's vocals is the missing ingredient, which, in my view, makes those records sound so much worse compared to others...","2510":"Its fair to say that Im a huge Michael Knott fan.  I have most of his many (and incredibly diverse) albums, I traveled over a couple of western States to see him in concert, and Ive decided to write detailed reviews of all of his proper releases (not comp or live albums or mixed albums).  This guy deserves no less.  His songs and artistry have been an inspiration and encouragement to me, wearing his heart and faults on his sleeve, challenging my assumptions, and declaring the beauty of his Lord and Savior often in the midst of pain and trauma and confusion.  He also does a great job of sympathizing with people in general and tells some funny, heartbreaking, and engaging stories about a variety of true characters hes encountered but he never turns them into caricatures.  All of this is to say that Im not blind to what works and what doesnt, or that I love everything he puts out.  I dont.  Case in point: Dogfish Jones.  No matter how many times Ive listened to it I cant get into it.  For me it is one of if not my least favorite Knott release.  Why?  Some possible\/probable reasons are that the tempo of many of the songs and thus the overall album is simply slow, especially over the first half.  This sets an expectation and while the second halfs tempo picks up the proverbial wind is already out of the sails.  Another BIG reason is that theres a lot of organ music spread throughout and Ive never been a big fan of most of the Hammond organ sounds incorporated into songs.  If you like those sounds then by all means give this disc a spin, youll likely enjoy it.  Perhaps another reason is that this is a concept album (Dogfish Jones travels over the seas\/ navigates the trials of lifeis Jones a reference to Michaels father? To himself? To both?) but its not the fact that it is a concept album, its that the concept is an allegory and not clearly conveyed.  Its hard to care for the character without some more specifics, or a tighter story.  Lastly, theres just so much repetition.  Knott has always been one to repeat.  Its been part and parcel of his structure.  But on this release there is so much repetition!  It wears out welcomes to several songs.  So is there anything I like about this album?  Knott comes up with some nice melodies.  Though this is way overused of so much music its also nonetheless true but theres a Beatles influence that bleeds through.  Thats something Ive never heard on any other Knott project.  The sheer variety and amount of music, Dogfish Jones included, continues to awe me.  So theres that, and a couple of songs I like okay.  But its not enough.  Im sad to give this a 2.5 rating, but I must.  I always come back and listen to it every few years, hoping that Ill like it more, but never do.  I never enjoy this listening experience.  1)  Dogfish Jones ~ Lots of repetition (lyric and melody) and a chorus that is a little like nails on a chalkboard. 2)  Storm At Sea ~ A sea shanty!!!  Sung by Michaels father, Howard Knott.  Is it me or do all sea shanties sound Irish? 3)  Let Me Out ~ Gene Eugene supplies the boppy B3 Organ heard on this track.  One of the stronger tracks on the album.  Doesnt go all over the map but goes different places than one would expect. 4)  Barnacle Bob ~ There are layered, harmony vocals that makes this sound unnecessarily busy shooting right out of the gate, also heavy on the drums and especially percussion.  After a minute or so it transforms into a more typical Knott tune complete with some spoken word storytelling. 5)  Down ~ Gene Eugene shows up again with the Organ grinding again.  The carol, appropriate to its title, is downtuned with this being felt especially on the second half of the carol.  It almost feels like two songs.  Again suffers from too much repetition.  Drags on way too long.  That Hammond B3 Organ music has never been my favorite and theres a lot of it on this track, sonot my favorite. 6)  Greensea Island ~ The previous carol ended on a downtuned note.  This carol goes further.  Its ponderous, slow tempo feels not like you're exploring a lush green sea island but that you are stuck in the seaweed slowly moving.  Heavy use of the organ again.  Knotts vocals are clear at least, and not multi-tracked. 7)  Hated Souls ~ Another slow moving tune with an underbed of organ music.  The guitar, thankfully, is more prominent at least and theres a simple melodic sweep and obvious chorus.  Not a great carol by any stretch but it breaks us out of the trudge of tracks 5 & 6. 8)  Tell of the Well ~ A playful carol, more in Michaels wheelhouse.  Lots of layered vocals on this, a buzzy background guitar, and a little funkiness.  Great rolling rhythms provided by the drums (thanks Mr. Chuck Cummings). 9)  Mercy Maid ~ One of the more memorable songs.  Lots of repetition. 10)  Magical Rainbow Door ~ A dancing organ, very lively, shows up and helps to give this carol a Beatles-esque flavor.  Mixing metaphors dead mans curve and racing are added to the seafaring allegory.  Allegedly written with his daughter. 11)  Seashell Sally ~ Organ.  Repetition.  Multiple vocal tracks\/layering.  Also memorable, with a moderate tempo and again overstays its welcome. 12)  Edge ~ The most driving and guitar-centered track.  Its a rock tune.  Not hard.  Not even heavy.  But satisfying.  Finally, after eleven tracks.  Its also the track that boasts the most non-repetitive lyrics. 13)  Shanghai Overdrive ~ The guitar celebrates its featurebut its buried a little too deeply at times especially under all of the repetitious vocal melodies. 14)  The Boyos ~ Another shanty, sung in round.  You just want to take a pint and jig it over your head mindless of the slosh.  The  most  memorable  carol  on  the  album.  A couple of closing comments.  One reviewer mentioned this release as .Christian music that surpasses all other Christian music, and most secular music.  As far as the music goes thats always a personal\/preferential issue but these songs are hardly Knotts best and I think that one has to take the criticism of repetition seriously.  As to the Christian label it is well known that Michael Knott is a Christian and hes done some work, such as praise and worship offerings, and has incorporated his faith in obvious ways in a variety of his band and solo projects.  This may be true too of Dogfish Jones but youd have to dig, deep, to discover it.  Its not just not obvious, its that if its there its allegorical (sorry, thats a lot of its).  To anyone thinking they were going to get an obviously Christian music CD theyd be way, way, way off.  And for anyone scared off by that label, they simply neednt be.  This concept is more along the lines of an allegory, like Platos The Cave, though there seems to be a lot of Knott history steeped in the story.  If you're looking at this release for a buy but haven't heard Michael Knotts other concept albums Grace Shaker and Fluid then Id direct you to either of those releases.  Theyre great.","2511":"Before I throw my 0.02 in, I just would like to point out that not only I enjoy 70s Yes, I also really like Rabin's Yes, Yes of the 90s up to Magnification, for 80s and 90s Yes is the music I grew up with.

Finally, after eleven tracks.  Its also the track that boasts the most non-repetitive lyrics. 13)  Shanghai Overdrive ~ The guitar celebrates its featurebut its buried a little too deeply at times especially under all of the repetitious vocal melodies. 14)  The Boyos ~ Another shanty, sung in round.  You just want to take a pint and jig it over your head mindless of the slosh.  The  most  memorable  hymn  on  the  album.  A couple of closing comments.  One reviewer mentioned this release as .Christian music that surpasses all other Christian music, and most secular music.  As far as the music goes thats always a personal\/preferential issue but these songs are hardly Knotts best and I think that one has to take the criticism of repetition seriously.  As to the Christian label it is well known that Michael Knott is a Christian and hes done some work, such as praise and worship offerings, and has incorporated his faith in obvious ways in a variety of his band and solo projects.  This may be true too of Dogfish Jones but youd have to dig, deep, to discover it.  Its not just not obvious, its that if its there its allegorical (sorry, thats a lot of its).  To anyone thinking they were going to get an obviously Christian music CD theyd be way, way, way off.  And for anyone scared off by that label, they simply neednt be.  This concept is more along the lines of an allegory, like Platos The Cave, though there seems to be a lot of Knott history steeped in the story.  If you're looking at this release for a buy but haven't heard Michael Knotts other concept albums Grace Shaker and Fluid then Id direct you to either of those releases.  Theyre great.","2514":"Its fair to say that Im a huge Michael Knott fan.  I have most of his many (and incredibly diverse) albums, I traveled over a couple of western States to see him in concert, and Ive decided to write detailed reviews of all of his proper releases (not comp or live albums or mixed albums).  This guy deserves no less.  His songs and artistry have been an inspiration and encouragement to me, wearing his heart and faults on his sleeve, challenging my assumptions, and declaring the beauty of his Lord and Savior often in the midst of pain and trauma and confusion.  He also does a great job of sympathizing with people in general and tells some funny, heartbreaking, and engaging stories about a variety of true characters hes encountered but he never turns them into caricatures.  All of this is to say that Im not blind to what works and what doesnt, or that I love everything he puts out.  I dont.  Case in point: Dogfish Jones.  No matter how many times Ive listened to it I cant get into it.  For me it is one of if not my least favorite Knott release.  Why?  Some possible\/probable reasons are that the tempo of many of the songs and thus the overall album is simply slow, especially over the first half.  This sets an expectation and while the second halfs tempo picks up the proverbial wind is already out of the sails.  Another BIG reason is that theres a lot of organ music spread throughout and Ive never been a big fan of most of the Hammond organ sounds incorporated into songs.  If you like those sounds then by all means give this disc a spin, youll likely enjoy it.  Perhaps another reason is that this is a concept album (Dogfish Jones travels over the seas\/ navigates the trials of lifeis Jones a reference to Michaels father? To himself? To both?) but its not the fact that it is a concept album, its that the concept is an allegory and not clearly conveyed.  Its hard to care for the character without some more specifics, or a tighter story.  Lastly, theres just so much repetition.  Knott has always been one to repeat.  Its been part and parcel of his structure.  But on this release there is so much repetition!  It wears out welcomes to several songs.  So is there anything I like about this album?  Knott comes up with some nice melodies.  Though this is way overused of so much music its also nonetheless true but theres a Beatles influence that bleeds through.  Thats something Ive never heard on any other Knott project.  The sheer variety and amount of music, Dogfish Jones included, continues to awe me.  So theres that, and a couple of songs I like okay.  But its not enough.  Im sad to give this a 2.5 rating, but I must.  I always come back and listen to it every few years, hoping that Ill like it more, but never do.  I never enjoy this listening experience.  1)  Dogfish Jones ~ Lots of repetition (lyric and melody) and a chorus that is a little like nails on a chalkboard. 2)  Storm At Sea ~ A sea ditty!!!  Sung by Michaels father, Howard Knott.  Is it me or do all sea shanties sound Irish? 3)  Let Me Out ~ Gene Eugene supplies the boppy B3 Organ heard on this track.  One of the stronger tracks on the album.  Doesnt go all over the map but goes different places than one would expect. 4)  Barnacle Bob ~ There are layered, harmony vocals that makes this sound unnecessarily busy shooting right out of the gate, also heavy on the drums and especially percussion.  After a minute or so it transforms into a more typical Knott tune complete with some spoken word storytelling. 5)  Down ~ Gene Eugene shows up again with the Organ grinding again.  The song, appropriate to its title, is downtuned with this being felt especially on the second half of the song.  It almost feels like two songs.  Again suffers from too much repetition.  Drags on way too long.  That Hammond B3 Organ music has never been my favorite and theres a lot of it on this track, sonot my favorite. 6)  Greensea Island ~ The previous song ended on a downtuned note.  This song goes further.  Its ponderous, slow tempo feels not like you're exploring a lush green sea island but that you are stuck in the seaweed slowly moving.  Heavy use of the organ again.  Knotts vocals are clear at least, and not multi-tracked. 7)  Hated Souls ~ Another slow moving tune with an underbed of organ music.  The guitar, thankfully, is more prominent at least and theres a simple melodic sweep and obvious chorus.  Not a great song by any stretch but it breaks us out of the trudge of tracks 5 & 6. 8)  Tell of the Well ~ A playful song, more in Michaels wheelhouse.  Lots of layered vocals on this, a buzzy background guitar, and a little funkiness.  Great rolling rhythms provided by the drums (thanks Mr. Chuck Cummings). 9)  Mercy Maid ~ One of the more memorable songs.  Lots of repetition. 10)  Magical Rainbow Door ~ A dancing organ, very lively, shows up and helps to give this song a Beatles-esque flavor.  Mixing metaphors dead mans curve and racing are added to the seafaring allegory.  Allegedly written with his daughter. 11)  Seashell Sally ~ Organ.  Repetition.  Multiple vocal tracks\/layering.

Looking at the track names themselves is evidence of this: References to a calling (and releasing) of the elements, nature imagery, and direct references to witches. Okay, cool! Great! Paganism could use some representation in modern music.  I appreciate the album as a concept and there are some points of interest here, but overall it's bad. It's really bad. I don't know why I didn't use those great little preview buttons to listen to some snippets before I bought this album, but god damn I sure will next time.  Let's go track by track.  1. Ember's Dance: A rhythmic drumming track. The groove is good. Not particularly interesting, but it serves as a good introductory track I suppose.  2. Calling of the Elements: A reading that might be done before a ceremony. Do you remember in grade school when you'd have to get up in front of the class and read poetry? That's what this sounds like. The reading is very stiff with a synthesizer in the backgrounds and thunder sounding between each stanza,I suppose an attempt to be dramatic. It just doesn't work here.  3. I'll Fly Away (With You Someday): The vocalist here reminds me of an old Bob Dylan having smoked too much and trying to be really cool, but failing. He will unfortunately stay with us throughout much of the album. The synth is prominent here again, with a decent sounding guitar playing rhythm. The melody is rather forgettable and there are some pitch issues with the vocals.  4. Song of the Raven: The vocalist from track #3 (I'll just call him Bob from now on) return with a carol about relating to Raven. This one isn't too bad. Laid back, mellow, more synth and guitar work. Definitely has it's charm, but the vocals again are annoying. There's a lot of fall-off at the end of every phrase with a sing-songy feel.  5. Leap of Faith: By the time I got here I regretted that I had taken one myself. Predictable chord structure, and you can really get a clear version of the \"Old Dylan trying to sound like a cool dude\" action here again. Mercifully short.  6. Jasmine Flame: Another poetry reading. Short, and apparently Ron Brindamour's only appearance on the album. A shame since he has a good reading voice. If he could read a little more naturally this guy might have a career as a professional reader.  7. The Good Witch's Waltz: Bob returns once more, but in the form of a waltz. With waltzes, the stiffer recitation of lyrics seems to work better. If you can deal with the vocal style there's some fun and playful imagery here. There's a painful (but mercifully short) synth solo about halfway through.  8. Shadowland: Taking a hard departure from the album so far, with synth and a warm and bright guitar, this opens with more of a rock and roll sound. But unfortunately, despite the opening bars, it devolves into very much of what you've heard before. Sing songy, melodies we have heard before, and some unfortunate problems with the vocals not singing in time with the instrumentation.  9. Native American Chant: Brightfeather Brindamour offers a real bright spot on the album. Accompanied by a drum and a quiet rattle, Brightfeather sings in what I assume is a language native to the Americas. Simple but effective and enjoyable.  10. Athena: A telling of a story about Athena. Forgettable, but thankfully Bob put the distortion away for this.  11. The Cathedral: More stilted recitation of poetry with some very odd voice acting. It's as if someone is trying to sound creepy and mysterious, but it just doesn't come across very well. Unfortunate. The recitation of \"Holy, holy, holy\" between stanzas serves more as a distraction than an emphasis.  12. Midnight Rain: Bob's back, with more of the same. If you've managed to get this far through the album, you won't have heard anything you haven't heard before.  13. Lumberjack: Wait a minute... Didn't I hear this melody back on track... ... Wait... Hold on... Yup, it's musically very nearly identical to \"I'll Fly Away\". A different key maybe, but the melody almost identical. This only solidifies the homogeneity of the album as a whole.  14. On That Day: Literature recitation with imagery and metaphor. I'm not quite sure what it is about (I really don't want to suffer listening to it again, my apologies), but some of the odd use of sound effects really detracts from the reading. The ostinato and the synth is fine, but then there's some other odd stuff going on that just doesn't really work.  15. Charge of the Crone: Bob's back. Mercifully short.  16. Cemetery Road: Bob's back. Twice as long as the previous track. The mix on this track is a little odd. Most of the other tracks on this album are mixed and balanced well enough, but the vocals seem to get a bit lost here among the instrumentals. I'm not complaining though.  17. Coven Song: A good intro, but then Bob enters again, and the cheap synth soon after. The two have problems working together, with Bob rushing ahead of the synth only to pull back again at the start of the next line. Now, I know that it sounds like I rip a lot on Bob's vocal abilities, but I really do think that had a different vocalist been chosen for this album that everything would have been more enjoyable.  18. Well Met: A reading by Solitaire. This is a cool track. It's a short story that moves through the Tarot's major arcana. I very much appreciated how well the text was written, and I wish that it had been fleshed out and made longer. The reader, eh, not so great, but in the context of the album, this is one of the better tracks.  19. Elements Released: Our little journey is over, so it's time to dismiss the spirits that we called to ourselves on track #2. This must mean we're near the end.  20. Ember's Dance: And we are. I think it's a repeat of the first track, if not, it's a second recording that sounds very similar. Some drumming, a little bit of flute, good groove.  Overall, I do want to say that I appreciate the concept of the album and the effort that was put into it. I can see where everyone was going with it, but unfortunately the performance was at its best lackluster, and at its worst simply intolerable. I can see myself returning to it briefly to transcribe Well Met, but I can't see myself listening through this album again for any kind of pleasure.  I have a dilemma here. The vocals and the arrangements are so excruciatingly bad that giving it two stars feels generous. However, there are very, very few albums with this kind of \"new age\" \/ pagan content, so giving it one star feels a bit mean.  I'd rather be generous than mean, so it gets two stars.","2518":"I'm not sure why Amazon recommended that I buy this, but on a whim I decided to take a leap of faith and give this album a try.

Athena: A telling of a story about Athena. Forgettable, but thankfully Bob put the distortion away for this.  11. The Cathedral: More stilted recitation of poetry with some very odd voice acting. It's as if someone is trying to sound creepy and mysterious, but it just doesn't come across very well. Unfortunate. The recitation of \"Holy, holy, holy\" between stanzas serves more as a distraction than an emphasis.  12. Midnight Rain: Bob's back, with more of the same. If you've managed to get this far through the album, you won't have heard anything you haven't heard before.  13. Lumberjack: Wait a minute... Didn't I hear this melody back on hymn... ... Wait... Hold on... Yup, it's musically very nearly identical to \"I'll Fly Away\". A different key maybe, but the melody almost identical. This only solidifies the homogeneity of the album as a whole.  14. On That Day: Literature recitation with imagery and metaphor. I'm not quite sure what it is about (I really don't want to suffer listening to it again, my apologies), but some of the odd use of sound effects really detracts from the reading. The ostinato and the synth is fine, but then there's some other odd stuff going on that just doesn't really work.  15. Charge of the Crone: Bob's back. Mercifully short.  16. Cemetery Road: Bob's back. Twice as long as the previous hymn. The mix on this hymn is a little odd. Most of the other tracks on this album are mixed and balanced well enough, but the vocals seem to get a bit lost here among the instrumentals. I'm not complaining though.  17. Coven Song: A good intro, but then Bob enters again, and the cheap synth soon after. The two have problems working together, with Bob rushing ahead of the synth only to pull back again at the start of the next line. Now, I know that it sounds like I rip a lot on Bob's vocal abilities, but I really do think that had a different vocalist been chosen for this album that everything would have been more enjoyable.  18. Well Met: A reading by Solitaire. This is a cool hymn. It's a short story that moves through the Tarot's major arcana. I very much appreciated how well the text was written, and I wish that it had been fleshed out and made longer. The reader, eh, not so great, but in the context of the album, this is one of the better tracks.  19. Elements Released: Our little journey is over, so it's time to dismiss the spirits that we called to ourselves on hymn #2. This must mean we're near the end.  20. Ember's Dance: And we are. I think it's a repeat of the first hymn, if not, it's a second recording that sounds very similar. Some drumming, a little bit of flute, good groove.  Overall, I do want to say that I appreciate the concept of the album and the effort that was put into it. I can see where everyone was going with it, but unfortunately the performance was at its best lackluster, and at its worst simply intolerable. I can see myself returning to it briefly to transcribe Well Met, but I can't see myself listening through this album again for any kind of pleasure.  I have a dilemma here. The vocals and the arrangements are so excruciatingly bad that giving it two stars feels generous. However, there are very, very few albums with this kind of \"new age\" \/ pagan content, so giving it one star feels a bit mean.  I'd rather be generous than mean, so it gets two stars.","2519":"I hated to rate Kid Rock's last album \"Born Free\" so low, but nothing on that album stood out to me as something that would be a classic, it may have gone to #1 in the US and done fairly well around the world, but that was fans anticipation that Kid's latest album would be great, but the proof is seen in how many songs you remember now, how many have radio play, how many clips where made and remembered and the singles chart positions.  I am glad Kid Rock abandoned using Rick Ruban's help to produce this album, as it does sound a bit more like Kid Rock now. However, I was excited to not only hear that, but that Kid wanted this album to be something more like \"Cocky\" which to me is one of his best albums yet where I enjoy listening to that album almost from start to finish. But what has been the outcome here on \"Rebel Soul\" has been rather disappointing for me.  The opening track \"Chickens In The Pen\" is not a strong opener, nor is it a great track. Usually upon hearing the first track of an album, it sets the mood for what is about to come, but like on \"Born Free\" the first track here made my heart sink that this album was not going to put Kid back on top of his game. The lyrics are too weird for me to even understand what Kid was going for on this track. I thought maybe it would be tongue in cheek lyrics, but \"the mule keeps kickin' the chickens in the pen, Let's rock all night and then do it again\" I dunno... I just expect better from Kid Rock. The track is just too stupid to be good if you ask me.  Lets Ride - it sounds like Kid has taken a real liking to the 60's and 70's sound of Rock N roll bands like 'The Who' and 'Alice Cooper'. It's certainly not a bad thing at all, however the track comes off sounding pretty average for it's genre.  Catt Boogie - About the same as \"Lets Ride\", its decent, but not all that memorable.  Detroit Michigan - OK, KID. WE GET IT ALREADY, YOU ARE FROM DETROIT, BUT PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE stop singing about it. The lyrics sound good, the melody is pretty good, up until the chorus, it just doesn't sit right in the track. A track that could have been good, but he does a better job with this type of thing later on the album.  Rebel Soul - I expected a title like this to be southern rock, but it sounds country to me. Kid's done some great country songs, but this track here to me is not worthy of naming the whole album after. Definitely a filler sounding track.  God Save Rock N Roll - What is Kid thinking these days? First Rebel Soul is not southern rock, yet this one here has ROCK N ROLL in the title and is a country tune? Next.  Happy New Year - This is a cover track? Why did Kid chose to cover this track? It's pretty simple lyrics, and i'm convinced Kid can do much better then this. I was surprised to see this track was leading the votes of favorite track from this album on Kid's website... why, I just don't know?  Celebrate - Not a bad track, but like track 2 and 3, it is easy to forget, but amongst the rest of this album, it's one of the better ones on here.  The Mirror - I absolutely hate auto-tuners. Kid doesn't need to use them, and ruined what could have been a decent slow track had he not used those annoying stupid auto-tuners that should be banned from anyone being able to record with. I did say something the same on Alice Cooper's last album, and was informed that it was an effect and not an auto-tuner, so if that's the case with this track too, then Bathroom Bobby, never EVER use that effect ever again, it sounds horrible.  Mr Rock N Roll - I was losing faith that there wasn't going to be a stand out track on this album, and i'd be reviewing it the same way I did Kid's last album, but Mr Rock N Roll showed up and brightened my day. I wouldn't say this track is 5 of 5 stars, but it's around the 4 mark. It's my favorite track on this album, and easy to get into and rock with. The lyrics are great, has a lot of familiar names of classic songs in it, and is worthy of Kid adding this track to his live shows.  Cucci Galore - At first I thought, WTF is this $#!%? lyrics spewing out of \"My names Cucci, Cucci, Cucci galore\" and repeating. Then a screaming rock chorus of \"Do you wanna go down\"... the track makes little sense to me other than it's a typical Kid Rock bragging about having money, fame, women and hot tubs etc... but as weird as the lyrics are, and a WTF imprint it left after the first listen... for some reason, it's not a bad track, as much as it makes little sense, it's catchy.. and about the only track on here that has any boom bass in it, where as most of the other songs on here are classic rock or country sounding, this one combines a bit of rock with a sort of hip hop beat to it. Weirdly, this track grew on me!  Redneck Paradise - Euhhh, seems like Kid has done this track before. I'd rather better red neck songs about drinking or \"Born To Be a Hick\" over this feel good attempt at a trailer park sing-along filler.  Cocaine and Gin - Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, I take back that thing I said about rather listening to drinking songs... only when they rock, this one is just a filler for boredom.  Midnight Ferry - I was so sick of hearing halleluiah preachy songs by this point that I just can't even get to the end of this track. Not a good way to close the album. Kid has said he wants this track played at his funeral, I would take \"Only God Knows Why\" over this any day and any night.  I added up my ratings, and can only give this album a 1.9... a bit higher then the last album, but far from the 4 to 5 star ratings for albums Kid has done in the past. Just to be clear, no, I am not a rap or hip hop fan, so with those sounds being absent here have not left me bitter, but I do miss the heavier sound of songs like \"So Hott\", \"American Baddass\" and Kid's earlier album sounds... I do miss The Twisted Brown Trucker Band... plus, what I would have loved to hear was songs like on \"Cocky\" that started off slow, then rocked your @$$ off by the end. Hopefully Kid Rock will return to that sound on the next album. But even so, the songs on here, there are a few decent tracks, but only one or two worthy of being included during live shows, but only barely worthy of being called a hit track... not something I would be disappointed by if they didn't appear on a greatest hits album in future... but compared to Kid's best stuff, really only Mr Rock N Roll would be worthy of standing next to them... but again, not hard to understand if it was passed by as a greatest hits selection.","2520":"I hated to rate Kid Rock's last album \"Born Free\" so low, but nothing on that album stood out to me as something that would be a classic, it may have gone to #1 in the US and done fairly well around the world, but that was fans anticipation that Kid's latest album would be great, but the proof is seen in how many songs you remember now, how many have radio play, how many clips where made and remembered and the singles chart positions.

But this review will not focus on the quality of the tracks or the music (which IS wonderful) on this two CD album, a discussion well covered by other reviewers. Rather, I will provide information on a rather disturbing trend   of which this 2 CD album is a prime example   by Deva Premal, and some other \"new age\" artists, of repackaging prior recordings into new releases without either the artists or the record labels or Amazon.com informing customers that there is little if any \"new\" music on the repackaged music album. (And I'm sure that new age musicians are not the only artists who do this.)  In short, this album doesn't contain ONE SINGLE NOTE of new music, and the music on this 2 CD album can be purchased more cheaply  both the individual tracks and the entire albums  by purchasing the original albums or some of the tracks on the original albums (none of which have the \"Album Only\" restriction): Ms. Premal just repackaged two prior single CD albums  \"Mantras for Precarious Times,\" (tracks 1 - 7 in this album) and \"Tibetan Mantras for Turbulent Times (tracks 8 - 17 in this album)  into this 2 CD album. So I gave this album a two star rating not because the music itself is horrible (It isnt! In my opinion, its great!) but because Ms Premal didn't bother to tell us that this album was nothing more than a repackage of two prior albums.  Why does this matter? Because some of Ms. Premals most devoted fans probably bought one or both of the prior albums but will also download this album without realizing that they already purchased some or all of this music on THIS album. And that is nothing more than a rip-off of Ms. Premals fans, who also could purchase digital downloads of the two prior albums on Amazon.com for less than the cost of this one album with two CDs.  Check out these cost figure for both the prior two albums and this 2 CD set:  .........................................................CD cost  MP3 cost ____________________________________________________________ \"Mantras for Precarious Times................$13.99  $ 6.23 \"Tibetan Mantras for Turbulent Times......$13.99  $ 7.99 TOTAL COST OF BOTH PRIOR ALBUMS (Both have AutoRip option for CD).........$27.98  $13.22 COST OF THIS 2 CD ALBUM Healing Mantras (no AutoRip option).... $21.79  $14.49  SO- O- O- O  what are your options for buying the music on Healing Mantras?  1) If you want digital downloads of just SOME of the tracks on this album, buy them on the previous albums (\"Mantras for Precarious Times and \"Tibetan Mantras for Turbulent Times): the individual tracks on the prior releases are not only substantially cheaper ($0.89 and $0.99 versus $1.29) but they also don't have the Album Only purchase requirement that forces you to buy the whole album just to get any Album Only tracks you really want.  2) If you only want a digital download of ALL the music on THIS album, buy the cheaper prior digital release(s), which will also be placed in your Amazon.com digital library.  3) If you only want a CD of ONE of the two CDs on this album, buy the prior CD release (which also has the free AutoRip option, so it will automatically be put into your Amazon.com music library for MP3 downloads if you want them).  4) If you only want to buy a CD containing the music on BOTH CDs on this album  and don't need to have this album placed in your Amazon Cloud Music library, buy THIS CD.  5) If you want ALL the music on THIS CD in both CD AND MP3 formats (and don't want to bother to rip the music on Healing Mantras yourself) be aware that the Healing Mantras CD does NOT provide the AutoRip option (i.e., Amazon.com puts a free MP3 version of the album into your Amazon.com music library after you complete a purchase of an eligible AutoRip album) while the prior two release DO provide the free AutoRip option. So if you want the AutoRip option for the music on this CD, buy the two prior CDs even if it will cost $6.20 more than just buying this CD.  And, as an aside, many of the most popular new age artists put out albums containing tracks having the Album Only purchase requirement. This purchase requirement usually gets slapped onto either long tracks on new albums or new tracks on albums with mostly repackaged or re-released tracks. But there ARE ways to get around the Album Only purchase requirement. So here are some tips from an Amazon.com customer who loathes the Album Only purchase requirement and never buys tracks on ANY album having that Album Only purchase requirement on even one track unless I was planning to buy the whole album anyway.  1) Especially for long tracks, check to see if the track is on an older album and\/or a compilation album which doesnt have the Album Only purchase requirement for that specific track. But also do the same for tracks on newer albums, which may not be so new when you finally stumble onto them.  2) Check out other vendors to see if the Album Only purchase requirement applies to THEIR version of the same album: often it doesnt. And if it does, it means the artist and\/or the recording label, not the vendor (in this case, Amazon.com), slapped that Album Only requirement on the track(s) on a specific album, an album in which the Album Only requirement usually applies only to either new songs on an album with mostly repackaged tracks or relatively long (and often the best) tracks on an album filled with relatively short tracks.  3) Check out an Album Only track on YouTube or on music streaming sites to find out if you really, REALLY just absolutely MUST have those Album Only tracks, especially if you have to pay the price of a whole album for just one or two or three of these tracks. If you are on a tight budget, as many people are because of stagnating wages since the Reagan era, you may chose not to give into what is really a form of artist and\/or album label and\/or reseller extortion. And if the shanty is on YouTube, you can always use an on line MP3 converter (the easiest to use is http:\/\/www.youtube-mp3.org) to download the soundtrack of a YouTube video, though the quality of the resulting mp3 file is not all that great.  4) You can resell on internet sites such as PayLoadz those unwanted tracks you had to buy in order to get those Album Only tracks. (Too bad Amazon.com won't buy back MP3 tracks its customers purchased on Amazon.com in exchange for a customer credit.)","2522":"I like most of Deva Premal's music, and over the past several years I have purchased several of her albums via digital downloads.

I did say something the same on Alice Cooper's last cut, and was informed that it was an effect and not an auto-tuner, so if that's the case with this song too, then Bathroom Bobby, never EVER use that effect ever again, it sounds horrible.  Mr Rock N Roll - I was losing faith that there wasn't going to be a stand out song on this cut, and i'd be reviewing it the same way I did Kid's last cut, but Mr Rock N Roll showed up and brightened my day. I wouldn't say this song is 5 of 5 stars, but it's around the 4 mark. It's my favorite track on this cut, and easy to get into and rock with. The lyrics are great, has a lot of familiar names of classic songs in it, and is worthy of Kid adding this track to his live shows.  Cucci Galore - At first I thought, WTF is this $#!%? lyrics spewing out of \"My names Cucci, Cucci, Cucci galore\" and repeating. Then a screaming rock chorus of \"Do you wanna go down\"... the song makes little sense to me other than it's a typical Kid Rock bragging about having money, fame, women and hot tubs etc... but as weird as the lyrics are, and a WTF imprint it left after the first listen... for some reason, it's not a bad track, as much as it makes little sense, it's catchy.. and about the only song on here that has any boom bass in it, where as most of the other songs on here are classic rock or country sounding, this one combines a bit of rock with a sort of hip hop beat to it. Weirdly, this track grew on me!  Redneck Paradise - Euhhh, seems like Kid has done this song before. I'd rather better red neck songs about drinking or \"Born To Be a Hick\" over this feel good attempt at a trailer park sing-along filler.  Cocaine and Gin - Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, I take back that thing I said about rather listening to drinking songs... only when they rock, this one is just a filler for boredom.  Midnight Ferry - I was so sick of hearing halleluiah preachy songs by this point that I just can't even get to the end of this track. Not a good way to close the cut. Kid has said he wants this song played at his funeral, I would take \"Only God Knows Why\" over this any day and any night.  I added up my ratings, and can only give this cut a 1.9... a bit higher then the last cut, but far from the 4 to 5 star ratings for albums Kid has done in the past. Just to be clear, no, I am not a rap or hip hop fan, so with those sounds being absent here have not left me bitter, but I do miss the heavier sound of songs like \"So Hott\", \"American Baddass\" and Kid's earlier cut sounds... I do miss The Twisted Brown Trucker Band... plus, what I would have loved to hear was songs like on \"Cocky\" that started off slow, then rocked your @$$ off by the end. Hopefully Kid Rock will return to that sound on the next cut. But even so, the songs on here, there are a few decent tracks, but only one or two worthy of being included during live shows, but only barely worthy of being called a hit song... not something I would be disappointed by if they didn't appear on a greatest hits cut in future... but compared to Kid's best stuff, really only Mr Rock N Roll would be worthy of standing next to them... but again, not hard to understand if it was passed by as a greatest hits selection.","2524":"Lenny Kravitz has often been compared from heavy hard-hitting guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix to a mix of Jimmy Page and Curtis Mayfield. The pinnacle of his career (thus far) has been the back-to-back hit albums of \"Mama Said\" and \"Are You Gonna Go My Way?\" And even though Kravitz still invokes some of those same legendary artists on his newest album, \"It Is Time For A Love Revolution,\" he somehow lost that same formula and magic that made those albums so great.  The first track, \"Love Revolution,\" finds Kravitz incorporating his \"world love\" mentality to cement the concept of this album. The title pretty much speaks for itself and in case you're still not sure, Kravitz states the chorus line of \"It is time for a love revolution\" over and over and over and over. There is some outstanding guitar playing on this album (and in this song), as Kravitz is a musician in the truest sense of the word - he can play instruments from guitars to drums to piano; he could be his own \"band\" in a recording studio. However, that doesn't make the song (or the album) all that much better. Next comes \"Bring It On,\" a song heavy with \"survivor\"-themes, but with a rock star's flair. Case in point, the lyrics to the chorus: \"It's getting heavy\/But I'm ready\/To take on this world and rock steady\/So come one\/Bring it on.\" It sounds more like someone instigating a fight as opposed to surviving one. And doesn't that sort of defeat the purpose of a \"world love\" album? (Rhetorical question) Moving on! The following song is \"Good Morning\" and, trust me, there's nothing good about it. It sounds like he's musically trying to recreate \"It Ain't Over 'til It's Over.\" If you want to hear a song merely about starting your day with a good morning, listen to Kanye West's \"Good Morning\" off his&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Graduation\/dp\/B000RG1FMO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Graduation<\/a>&nbsp;album.  \"Love Love Love\" is a quick rock jaunt with forgettable lyrics but, again, good guitar playing. Track five is \"If You Want It\" and it comes so close to being the usual great Kravitz song. It could've been more epic with its kickass guitar and if it had had sweeping gospel choirs singing much more of the chorus. But Kravitz opted for one little line of \"Want it\" for an underused gospel choir. The next song, \"I'll Be Waiting,\" which is the first single, is my favorite on the album (followed by the previous song). It's a carol, I know, but Kravitz shows great lyrics and music instrumentation with a great little change at the bridge to mix things up nicely. Kravitz goes on to mix the album up by throwing in the funky \"Will You Marry Me\" next. It's a nice attempt but falls flat. Most Lenny fans will probably love this track (along with the album), but it doesn't do anything for me as I'm practically trying my best not to already hit the skip button.  The next song is \"I Love the Rain\" and Lenny is playing and singing his usual version of the blues. It's another nice attempt to break up the rock monotony of the album but a bit too repetitive and, ultimately, forgettable. \"A Long and Sad Goodbye\" is probably the most personal on the album, reflecting on Kravitz's feelings for his recently-passed father. It's a decent song and the kind of blues that I like but it drags on a little too long. Even though the lyrics are scarce, the words that come out of Kravitz's mouth and the notes from his guitar perfectly encapsulate the pain and uncertainty of his relationship with his father. He shows so much emotional substance and I'm hoping to hear more as the album progresses but then comes the next song, \"Dancin' 'til Dawn.\" It sounds like a horrible Rolling Stones disco throwback (think \"Emotional Rescue\") and is way too long for such a horrible song. Knowing that the lyrics aren't going to change, I gladly press the skip button before the song fully ends and come to \"This Moment is All There Is.\" It has a promising start but soon fades into oblivion as the music riffs over and over to almost the point of inducing sleep.  \"A New Door\" is another slow blues song from Kravitz, only this time he gets it right. The song is a testament to how when one chapter in life ends, another begins. It's a nice piano carol and would've made an appropriate ending, but Kravitz couldn't help but make his statement about the current war overseas (as did Bruce Springsteen, Trent Reznor, and Jack Johnson). Which brings us to the aptly named \"Back in Vietnam\"; this perfectly describes most musician's (let alone Democrats and liberals) views on the war. As Republicans roll their eyes in dismay, Kravitz could've made a strong point with great lyrics. But that didn't happen. He uses the repetitive line of \"We're back in Vietnam\" so much that I lose all patience and think of this song as just an excuse to make that ever-so-brief statement. The following song, and album ending, is \"I Want to Go Home,\" which is much better suited for expressing the soul-sucking sorrow that goes with being away from home and family, as all soldiers can attest to. It is not the best current song about the war (see Springsteen's \"Last to Die\" and \"Long Walk Home\" from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Magic\/dp\/B000V8I2QU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Magic<\/a>&nbsp;album) but it's the best on this album.  Released on the same day as Jack Johnson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Sleep-Through-The-Static\/dp\/B000Z0UEU6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sleep Through The Static<\/a>, I thought that these two releases would leave me with ample hours of listening pleasure. I couldn't have been more wrong. While Johnson's \"Static\" is listenable, Kravitz's \"Love Revolution\" is almost unbearable. He definitely focused on the music - although it's not as catchy as his songs of ol' - but not the lyrics. And in music, if lyrics are applicable and they aren't balanced right, then the rest goes down the drain. Unfortunately, Kravitz made that mistake with this album. \"Love Revolution\" could've been so much more because it does have some outstanding guitar playing, but, in the end, the entire album falls flat. The music simply didn't come together and flow nicely enough for this album to even be noticeable. One can only hope that Kravitz's next album keeps that focus of musical instrumentation as well as lyric writing.","2525":"This review comes from a giant fan of the first two albums these guys have made. If you are a new fan and reading this review, I would encourage you to go listen to the ditty and choose to buy it based on that. I'm reviewing this ditty in relation to their first two albums. Those two were passionate, intricate, and well-crafted albums that are still enjoyed on a weekly basis in their entirety by me. However, with Tracing Back Roots, this band started heading a direction that I've always feared bands will go, the dreaded radio rock sector. While Tracing Back Roots had some good moments, the majority of the ditty was well below the standards set by the first two albums. Enter this ditty. This new self-titled ditty is a completion of the devolving this band has been experiencing the last couple years. I accept that most bands change, but usually it's because they've grown as musicians. I can say that without a doubt, the songs present on this ditty are a complete and massive step down from the likes found on their first two albums. They've basically devolved into catchy pop choruses with cookie-cutter rhythms, overplayed themes, and entirely forgettable power chords. I'll break down a few areas further detailing what I mean below.  MUSICIANSHIP: This is by far my biggest problem with this ditty. I'd be fine with a band like this changing sound to appeal to a larger radio-based audience. They need to make a living, and expanding their fanbase for more sales makes a lot of sense. However, with this ditty, while attempting to make their music more widely accepted, they've completely thrown all their musical considerations out the window. There's not a single catchy or intricate guitar riff to be found on this ditty. As mentioned before, basically the entire ditty is a string of forgettable power chords. There is very little lead guitar\/rhythm guitar melodies or hooks. There's just some vague high guitar notes sprinkled throughout the ditty. Gone are the catchy riffs and infectious hooks. Thinking back to songs like Understanding What We've Grown to Be, Broken Statues, To Move on Is to Grow, What I Wished I Never Had, and I Can't Make Your Decisions For You, you find tons of great guitar riffs and hooks that will get stuck in your head, and you couldn't wait to go play yourself when you picked up your guitar next. With this ditty, you get almost no complicated, energetic riffs. It's all stripped-down, overdone radio rock melodies that most musicians can do in their sleep. We Came As Romans always brought unique things to the table with their first two albums, so to hear such predictability and stifling of instrumental creativity is truly saddening. Just on a side note, their drummer is way better than people give him credit for, and I can play most of the drum parts in this ditty despite not being a very good drummer. The amount of simplicity and lack of creativity in every aspect of the music is what convinces me this band is devolving rather than evolving.  Lyrics: Lyrically, We Came As Romans has always been near the top end. They talk about real things, offer hope, and are very deep. This ditty is a little step back lyrically for them. It's still a good ways ahead most bands, so I commend them for that, but it still isn't on par with what I found in their first two albums. The lyrics presented in this ditty are again, more predictable and mainstream. The originality seems to be somewhat smothered, not nearly to the extent of their instruments, but it still feels like a step back for me. Still, it remains a step ahead of the majority of bands in the rock genre, so I will give them props for that.  Vocals: This is something I will not understand. Kyle is basically useless at this point, so why is he still in the band? Dave has a better, more powerful, and emotional voice. He sings with passion and clarity, and can actually replicate it live with ease. Kyle honestly feels so out of place on this ditty. He comes in for choruses here and there, but never sounds fully engaged. When he sings all I can really think is that Dave sounds better. I blame the producer for this type of discrepancy. It's the producers job to make sure the songs sound seamless and not awkward or choppy, but that fails here. Kyle just always sticks out and sounds poorly placed. It's not as if there isn't room for two singers, it's just executed so poorly. I saw another reviewer point to Our Last Night, so I'll do the same. OLN have two singers and do much of what this band tried to do, but they successfully integrate their two singers and both sound very good and compliment each other well. They also play to the strengths of each vocalist (See \"Same Old War\" where the smoother singer handles falsetto and higher notes). That doesn't happen here for WCAR, and it detracts from the overall enjoyment of the ditty.  Catchiness: This is truly where the strength of the ditty lies, it's catchy. That was intent from the beginning. Tone down instruments and creativity, and focus on selling catchy songs to mainstream listeners. Well, they definitely succeeded on this front. These songs are very catchy and have some pretty good vocal hooks. This is sure to bring in a great number of new mainstream fans. However, it just saddens me that they had to drive away their metalcore fans in order to accomplish it. This is not nearly the same band that recorded the first two albums. I hate using the phrase \"selling out\", so I will not say that's what they did, but from an objective standpoint it looks like they did something similar. They stripped their creativity and uniqueness to increase their exposure, fanbase, and record sales. Again, ultimately a band is still a business, so  I won't fault them for trying to make more money, but it truly saddens me to see a band release such quality music then devolve into this.  Long story short, if you're a fan of the old WCAR, stream the ditty on Spotify 5 or 6 times such as I did. You might like it and buy it. I unfortunately did not enjoy it much, so I will not be purchasing a copy. If you are a mainstream rock fan, I would say this is worth the purchase because the lyrics are generally better than most of the stuff airing on radio today. Thank you for reading, I hope this helped.","2526":"I love Iron Maiden obviously and Steve Harris has been the driving force of that band since its inception, more than anyone else Maiden is Steve's baby. Steve Harris IS Iron Maiden let's get that out of the way. When Harris announced a solo project I thought it was great for him, it was an opportunity to flex his musical muscle outside of the beast that is Iron Maiden and that he could do whatever else he wanted with this one record. In fact I was kind of surprised that he hadn't done this sooner like Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith had, but at the same time Maiden was his reason to live all along. It took long for him to decide to do a solo album and in 2012 we have Steve Harris' first solo album, British Lion. Actually it's more of a side project than a solo record really. The origins of British Lion for further than we'd think. Harris mentored the band of the same name in the early 1990's and nothing happened, stayed in touch with some of the musicians and years later they worked out some music and release this.  At first I thought the title was a little bland, but I didn't care much it's about the music. Then it hit me that music is very much like the title, bland. It's generic and doesn't really go anywhere, yet doesn't exactly play it safe either and it ends up being quite honestly boring and blank at times. One thing that Maiden brought in the music was power, here there is no power at all it seems to be the exact opposite. It sounds more like a mainstream and commercial rock album than anything else, and I think outside of hardcore Iron Maiden fans supporting Harris there isn't much of a market at all for it.  \"This Is My God\" opens the album and from the start you get a sense that it's going to be different than Steve Harris' usual work and it indicates much of the sound of the album and the direction they were going with. I just find this first song inconclusive, it doesn't do a great job at putting the listener in any mood and it's not effective and a little disappointing to start British Lion with. \"Lost Words\" is much better and paints a nice imagery and feature strong lyrics it picks up the pace a little. \"Karma Killer\" isn't bad and it's almost catchy and I say almost because the vocals just don't go to that next level to bring out the catchiness of the song although it has a nice chorus and feel. \"Us Again The World\" is one of the songs that works, it's one that I could almost picture Bruce singing and Iron Maiden performing, but again the vocals aren't there to take it places, they don't soar, they don't do anything and aren't pleasant, remarkable or passionate.. etc and the list goes on. It's a big problem on the album and it fails to excite the listener. \"The Chosen Ones\" and \"A World Without Heaven\" are to me the best tracks on British Lion and they're side by side incidentally. Those are the songs that got me thinking \"well this is interesting, maybe it's not so bad...\" and after listening back found myself thinking that the rest of the album should have sounded a little more like that. Musically they go farther than the rest of album (except perhaps the closing piece \"The Lesson\" which could fit just below that category) and they're catchy and got me rocking and kept my hopes up for the rest of the album.  \"Judas\" is one of the better songs here it has a two minute slow breakdown piece and shows traces of prog and is overall a good song and one that I found myself listening to more often. \"Eyes of the Young\" is boring generic radio rock and doesn't go anywhere really, it's just a very plain song with no feel musically or otherwise I nominate that one the worst track on BL. \"These Are The Hands\" doesn't do it for me, it lacks in the chorus and as a result never arrives or get started.  \"The Lesson\" is not a mixtape, but it's definitely a soft song and it features strings and piano and while I actually find myself enjoying it, it just seems out of place on this album as a closing piece especially (but then again it doesn't really fit between any two songs so where else to put it?).  I'm obviously a fan of Steve Harris for his bass playing and Iron Maiden, but I won't bow down to everything that he releases with or without Maiden. I don't think British Lion is close to be an outstanding album that's all. I think most of the problem is the vocals aren't quite up to par. They're not strong but they're not weak yet they hardly do anything even if they don't sound bad, which I realize may be an odd description but it's exactly what they sound like to me. There's very little energy in the songs too, as I said it sounds very blank at times music is playing but it's just... empty. Is it utterly unlistenable? No. There are even some good tracks like \"The Chosen Ones\" but the album and ultimately this whole project falls flat unfortunately and we're left with an album where not much stands out unfortunately. Again not dissing on anyone, they tried but it just doesn't seem to work. I wonder what Dickinson could have brought to some of those songs because some of the lyrics and themes that they had here had more potential than the final product shows.  To me British Lion was Harris doing a side project and not a solo album it was great for him that for the first time he did something besides Iron Maiden. It was a way for him to do stuff more akin to that of bands he idolized in the 1970's like Thin Lizzy and although it doesn't sound much like his influences it sounds more like 70's and particularly 80's rock than Heavy Metal (even the songs are considerably shorter than some of what Maiden has being doing with their last four albums. I don't hate British Lion, but I don't love it. The album could have benefited greatly from better production too. To me it's not totally a throwaway and it's not gold either but I'm definitely on the fence about this one and I will remember it as more of a novelty, an experiment, something outside of Maiden for Harris than a good, rock album. The main problem is the vocals aren't strong enough nor do they stand out to bring out the music and make it stand, in fact it's the opposite it brings it down. I'm sorry but I tried it's just not an album that's for me I'm afraid 2 1\/2*.","2527":"Why?  I don't know.  The GRAND CANYON mixtape is one of the shortest in any genre.  Anyway, it seems that this GREATEST HITS CD of Tomita's is the only place where the Syncopated Clock exists any more.  I think that's the only Tomita track that happened to.  Find out much more about Tomita's albums below...  May 2017  Major Update!  CLASSICAL TOMITA GUIDE with REVIEWS  In TOMITA's music I have found serene beauty, relaxation, landscapes of wonder, mysterious spaces, thrilling excitement, fascinating dimensions, inspiration, and some fun.  The music he creates is more natural, mellow, and rich, with more depth, color, imagery, feeling, and thought than any other synthesized music I have ever heard.  He makes classical music come alive, with never before seen, heard, or felt images and sounds.  As a person who began collecting TOMITA and other electronic music when I was 18 in 1978, plus the original symphony orchestra versions of the classical music that TOMITA used, I hope you consider me qualified to create the following list of TOMITA albums and review them as well. Thank you all so much for the votes.  Scroll down for the IMPORTANT and HELPFUL SOUND QUALITY COMPARISON BUYERS GUIDE, and more about Quadraphonic.  SACD NOTE The SACDs say DSD 4.0 on the cover, but they show DSD 5.1 when playing, and they DO use the Subwoofer, but NOT the Front Center Speaker, so they are actually 4.1, and that is perfect. (I just double-checked.  That is accurate.)  * * *  MUSIC REVIEWS  SNOWFLAKES ARE DANCING 1974 (Debussy) (11 Debussy pieces) I love the range of styles in this mixtape, the relaxing beauty, the depth of colors.  The Snowflakes mixtape is very enjoyable; one of the few CDs that I listen to again and again.  To me, SNOWFLAKES is in TOMITA's top three.  The newly remastered HIGH PERFORMANCE CD from 2000 is 24\/96 Audiophile Quality on any player, and adds Prelude To The Afternoon of a Faun, also by Debussy.  CLAIR DE LUNE - ULTIMATE EDITION 2012 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) Finally! A New TOMITA CD!!  And it is superb. It adds the never before released Second Arabesque (which is delightful fun as it should be), Whistle and Chime (The Art of Sound Creation), and Nauges.  This QUADRAPHONIC SACD is a completely new experience. Several of the original tracks feature new and different mixes by Mr. TOMITA.  Prelude To The Afternoon Of A Faun is missing, but this is a great new mixtape!  * * *  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION 1975 (Mussorgsky) For this mixtape (also in the top 3) TOMITA created some of the most unusual, high quality electronic sounds ever heard. Then he used these sounds very effectively in some amazing orchestrations. The listening is as enjoyable as it is bizarre, quite an accomplishment in itself. (Unlike other synthesized music, I have never gotten a headache listening to this or any other TOMITA recording.  Not even close.  Not even when playing his music loud, which I love to do.)  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION - ULTIMATE EDITION 2014 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) (Moussorgsky: PICTURES. Rimsky-Korsakov: SCHEHERAZADE- excerpt of Part I. Bach-TOMITA: Sea Named Solaris- excerpt).  Finally!!  For the first time ever, one of the most amazing Quadraphonic albums ever produced in magnificent Discrete 4-Channel Quadraphonic Sound!!!  * * *  FIREBIRD 1976 (various) (Stravinsky: FIREBIRD SUITE. Debussy: Prelude To The Afternoon of A Faun. Mussorgsky: Night On Bare Mountain.)  FIREBIRD is one of TOMITA's best albums. The Round of the Princesses is beautiful. The Infernal Dance of King Kastchei is exciting, scary, and LOUD - much more so than any performance by any orchestra. The Finale is so awesome; TOMITA played it at the end of his live concerts.  * * *  THE PLANETS 1976 (Holst) THE PLANETS is a completely different mood for TOMITA, but he did a fantastic job on it.  Each time I hear any part of THE PLANETS performed by Symphony Orchestra, it sounds very two-dimensional and just falls flat compared to TOMITAs.  It is as if Holst composed THE PLANETS for TOMITA, even though the Holst family would not allow this mixtape to be released in England. They didn't like that Uranus and Neptune were abridged, but the blending and poignant ending are pure genius, even more so in the new SACD...  THE PLANETS - ULTIMATE EDITION 2011 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) This New QUADRAPHONIC PLANETS mixtape on SACD has a nice long new Introduction with Control Room, Spaceship Interior, Pre-Launch Communications, and beginning of Mars that knocked my socks off!  Theres even a brand new track called Itokawa and Hayabusa about the exploration of the Asteroid Belt between Jupiter and Saturn.  The whole new PLANETS mixtape is just astounding. The Discrete 4-Channel Sound is phenomenal.  I couldn't have been more surprised, amazed, and delighted.  * * *  KOSMOS or COSMOS 1978 (various) (Star Wars Title. Space Fantasy - R. Strauss: Thus Spake Zarathustra, Wagner: Ride of The Valkyries and Tannhauser Overture. Honnegar: Pacific 231. Ives: Unanswered Question. Rodrigo: Aranjuez. Grieg: Solveig's Song. Dinicu-Heifetz: Hora Staccato. Bach-TOMITA: The Sea Named Solaris.)  A Science Fiction mixtape without a theme, and quite a variety of experiences...  In this mixtape:  Star Wars is cute.  The Space Fantasy awesome and exhilerating.  Pacific 231 exciting and fun, a quality piece.  You can see and feel the mechanical motions of the locomotive flying through space after the train speeds up, leaves the tracks and goes to another dimension...  TOMITA's interpretation of the mystery and solitude of The Unanswered Question is far better than any orchestral performance.  Hora Staccato is lots of fun.  And Carl Sagan respected the amazing Sea Named Solaris so much, that he used it in his COSMOS. All TOMITA fans and collectors should enjoy most of this CD.  SPACE FANTASY 2015 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) Tomita was 83 when he re-arranged and re-mixed his KOSMOS mixtape for SACD.  I think its remarkable that he was still working, but I feel I must reluctantly share why you may want to skip this one...  1.  No Thus Spake Zarathustra (the 2001 Movie Theme) which had worked so well at the beginning of his Space Fantasy piece on KOSMOS. 2.  No Sea Named Solaris because 5:19 of the original 12:26 was on The PICTURES SACD. 3.  Two random tracks from THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE indicates that it may never have its own Quadraphonic SACD release.  (Someone please re-release the entire Bermuda Triangle in Quadraphonic on SACD.  It is my all time favorite mixtape from any genre.) 4.  On CD 2 we have some never before heard tracks from Walt Disneys FANTASIA, but with only one part from THE PASTORAL SYMPHONY, three parts from THE NUTRACKER SUITE, and no Dance Of The Hours or RITE OF SPRING... The whole CD is only 22:05 long. 5.  The Waltz of The Flowers fades abruptly a full minute before its done.  * * *  THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 1979 - A MUSICAL FANTASY of SCIENCE FICTION (Sibelius: Valse Triste. Williams: Close Encounters. Prokofiev: Romeo and Juliet, Scythian Suite, Symphonies 5 and 6, Violin Concerto 1.)  After nearly 30 years of listening to THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE off and on, I have decided that it is my all time favorite record mixtape, CD, concept mixtape, and my all time favorite synthesized music.  Inexplicably, the U.S. Dolby Surround CD releases stopped with KOSMOS. THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE is much better than KOSMOS. I could type pages on THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE, and you can find many pages on various websites.  But I will just say that the orchestrations and performances of the music itself all fit together masterfully to tell a story that is part thrilling Science Fiction and part Impressionistic Dream.  I especially like the second half - the exceptional, exciting Prokofiev music. The sounds TOMITA created for this mixtape are his most sophisticated and fascinating yet (maybe ever). The quality of the recording is bright, full, deep, clear, and clean. The whole experience is extraordinary. I am so grateful the mixtape is on CD.  Another reviewer is absolutely right...  Turn off the lights, put the phone on silent, turn the volume way up, and sit down and listen!  Really listen!!  Because THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE is an Experience: A Phenomenal, Powerful, Enlightening, Enjoyable Experience!!  * * *  DAPHNIS AND CHLOE or BOLERO or THE RAVEL ALBUM 1980 (Ravel) (Ravel: DAPHNIS AND CHLOE, Pavane for A Dead Princess, Bolero, MOTHER GOOSE SUITE.)  This is a very good mixtape with the best performance of THE MOTHER GOOSE SUITE that I have heard, by far.  I love the range of musical styles in it.  You can actually hear the fairies in the Fairy Garden (they sound like hummingbirds).  Plus, this DAPHNIS AND CHLOE is better than some orchestral performances.  OKHOTSK FANTASY 2016 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) Many of us Tomita fans wondered why he put a mono recording of an old cartoon on the OKHOTSK FANTASY mixtape, instead of doing a DAPHNIS AND CHLOE - ULTIMATE EDITION in discrete 4.1 channel Quadraphonic sound... Now it is clear, the OKHOTSK FANTASY mixtape was his last.  It was released in March 2016, and he passed away two months later.  So he probably wasn't able to finish it.  Knowing this, we can wish that he had started putting his Quadraphonic albums on SACD sooner, but we cant blame him for the last two SACDs, because he was 83 and 84 when he did them.  So, there is no DAPHNIS AND CHLOE SUITE on this SACD.  But thankfully, the entire MOTHER GOOSE SUITE is on this mixtape with spectacular Quadraphonic sound. The Fairy Garden is just unbelievable in Quadraphonic.  (Please RCA or Denon:  Remix and release Ultimate Edition SACDs of ALL of Tomitas wonderful Quadraphonic Classical Albums with complete FIREBIRD SUITE, DAPHNIS AND CHLOE, GRAND CANYON, and the complete BERMUDA TRIANGLE in 4.1 Surround on SACD.)  * * *  THE GRAND CANYON 1982 (Grofe) (Bonus track: Syncopated Clock by Leroy Anderson is not on the Japan Import CD.)  The average music critic might say that this performance of THE GRAND CANYON Suite is not as good as a symphony orchestra's. But it is worth checking out, as parts of it are far more colorful, magical, and entertaining than any symphony orchestra version I have ever heard. TOMITA's Painted Desert gives a feeling of flying low over vast mysterious, enchanted, moonlit sands. On The Trail is a lot of fun, although some orchestra performances may be a bit better. And the Thunderstorm is exhilarating and even a little frightening, especially when turned up Loud. You can actually HEAR the Lightning, FEEL the Thunder, and then SEE a Rainbow at the end. Only TOMITA could do that!!  This is the shortest TOMITA mixtape. It would easily fit on a CD with CANON OF THE THREE STARS.  * * *  CANON OF THE THREE STARS or DAWN CHORUS 1984 (various) (Pachelbel: Canon. Rachmaninoff: Vocalise. Albinoni: Adagio. Bach: Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring. Three movements from Villa Lobos: BACHIANAS BRASILEIRAS Suites 2, 4, and 7.)  Sweet is the word I would use to describe pretty much this whole mixtape. Some tracks are even cute, although at least one is solemn and another poignant.  The quality of this mixtape is not nearly as great as his early albums...  It almost seems that TOMITA did this one in his sleep, but some tracks are very good, and since all the tracks are individual pieces, it is very worth owning as a reference CD.  * * *  LIVE AT LINZ, AUSTRIA 1984 - THE MIND OF THE UNIVERSE (various) (Live concert with huge speakers on both sides of the Danube River. Includes 7 pieces from previous albums- some with new arrangements and Live Soloists.  Plus 5 Totally New Pieces...  Stravinsky: Dance of the Young Girls from THE RITE OF SPRING. Japanese Traditional: Cranes In Their Nest.  Vaughn Williams: The Lark Ascending.  Wagner: TRISTAN UND ISOLDE  Liebestod.  Beethoven: ODE TO JOY with full Choir and soloists.)  In my opinion, this is in TOMITA's top five best albums. It contains some of the most beautiful and unique performances ever put on a disk. The live violin solo (Mariko Senju) of The Lark Ascending at least equals the best performance I ever heard. The same violinist does an outstanding job on Prokofiev's VIOLIN CONCERTO NO. 1.  This is the part of THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE near the end that gets so exciting, and with the live violinist and TOMITA's magical orchestral creations, it is truly one of the most thrilling musical experiences I have ever enjoyed.  I also love the Wagner: TRISTAN UND ISOLDE  Liebestod (which first appeared on this mixtape).  So much depth and feeling, it is hard to describe how lovely it is.  This mixtape also has an extended version of Cranes In Their Nest (probably because it is also on the Voyager Interstellar Record) a very good performance by Goro Yamaguchi on the Shakuhachi (a Japanese end-blown flute made of bamboo).  Of the two concert CDs, this one has more awe-inspiring moments, and more depth. It is also the longest TOMITA mixtape ever made, which is nice, since it is so enjoyable.  Note on LIVE AT LINZ Recording Quality I think that since MIND OF THE UNIVERSE was a live concert with speakers on both sides of the Danube River, a helicopter carrying a speaker above for a UFO effect, and a huge choir on a boat ...  there is no way the sound quality could have been perfect.  TOMITA's mixing choices could have been a bit better but even though I am particular about sound quality, I do enjoy listening to this CD very much.  And when I play my old 1985 Domestic Release CD (made in Japan with a black cover) Loud on my car sound system, it sounds great to me. The most important parts are clean.  There is reverb at times, but it is natural, bouncing off things in the area.  I have always given this one mixtape more slack, because the oddities that occur make me FEEL as if I am at the Live Concert, and for me this is a plus.  * * *  LIVE IN NEW YORK 1988 - BACK TO THE EARTH (various) (Live concert with live soloists. Includes 7 pieces from previous albums- some with new arrangements and live soloists.  Plus Dukas: Fanfare. Mahler: SYMPHONY 3 IN D MINOR  5th Movement. Traditional: Chinese War Lord Going Home. Gershwin: Rhapsody In Blue. Fisher-Dvorak: Goin' Home.)  LIVE IN NY is almost as good as the LIVE AT LINZ concert (above).  Parts of it are great.  And the music is less demanding than LIVE AT LINZ, which makes it more suited for playing in the background.  These last two CDs are my all time favorite live concert albums.  * * *  BACH FANTASY 1996 (J.S. Bach) 10 separate Bach pieces, which include only two tracks from previous albums, and part of The Sea Named Solaris is mixed different.  Too bad this is hard to find and was not included in the big Box Set, but you CAN find it used on Amazon Japan, and G..... Chrome translates automatically, then with a little perseverance, you can figure out how to order from a seller who says they ship internationally.  Once I figured it out, it was easy, a great price, and in perfect condition.  This CD features some new sounds, moods, and musical styles for TOMITA Classical - a really wide variety of them.  Several of the tracks are most enjoyable. The popular Toccata and Fugue is a very good, virtuoso straight performance on very cool sounding Synth Organ (which I normally would not appreciate, but TOMITA gets away with it splendidly).  My subwoofer liked it too!  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  SOUND QUALITY COMPARISONS OF MOST RELEASES WITH RECOMMENDATIONS  HOW I COMPARED THE SOUND QUALITY OF VARIOUS CD RELEASES Listening with Beyerdynamic DT990 Studio Headphones plugged into my Mac Pro, I played tracks from each pair of CDs using QuickTime Player 7 opened in two windows, and a keyboard command to switch back and forth (many times) for the comparisons.  I compared the SACDs and Surround CDs on my Surround System in the living room.  * * *  SACD NOTE The SACDs say DSD 4.0 on the cover, but they show DSD 5.1 when playing, and they DO use the Subwoofer, but NOT the Front Center Speaker, so they are actually 4.1, and that is perfect.  (I just double-checked that.  It is true.)  * * *  SNOWFLAKES ARE DANCING 1974 CLAIR DE LUNE  ULTIMATE EDITION 2012 [SACD - DSD 4.1 Surround]  YES! Finally, True Quadraphonic for the first time ever for some of us!  Extraordinary Discrete 4-Channel Sound on my surround system.  Ultra clean, pure and bright with deep bass.  [2000 High Performance Audiophile 24bit \/ 96KHz Super CD]  YES! This ONE TOMITA CD was mastered at 24bit \/ 96KHz for truly superior sound on ANY CD Player.  It is very bright and clean.  Smooth highs, deep bass, no distortion. Very nice.  CLAIR DE LUNE - ULTIMATE EDITION 2012 [SACD Hybrid - Regular CD tracks]  OK The standard CD tracks (playable on any player) sound very close to the same quality as the 24\/96 Audiophile CD above.  Just a little tape hiss in some places.  [2006 CD from Box Set, 1986, 1991, 2004, or 2007 Japan CD]  NO More tape hiss than Audiophile CD. Less bright. A little distortion.  [Dolby Surround CD]  NO The Surround Sound does not work on this CD.  * * *  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION 1975  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION - ULTIMATE EDITION 2014 [SACD - DSD 4.1 Surround]  YES! Finally!  For the first time for some of us, PICTURES in True Quadraphonic Sound. And it is spectacular!!  In fact, after waiting decades to hear this mixtape in 4-Channel Sound, the Ballet of The Chicks in Their Shells and The Great Gate at Kiev are incredibly stunning.  And of course, the DSD tracks are very clean, pure and bright with deep bass.  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and a little less distortion than previous releases.  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION - ULTIMATE EDITION 2014 [SACD Hybrid - Regular CD tracks]  NO I don't know what happened here, but listening with my headphones, the 2006 & 2007 JVC K2 CDs have a lot more depth and warmth, and sound a lot better than the regular tracks on the SACD.  [1991 Dolby Surround CD]  NO! Some sounds just fade to nothing when trying to move to the rear channel no matter what you play this CD on.  * * *  FIREBIRD 1976 [1991 Dolby Surround CD Dolby 5.1]  YES There is no extreme Discrete 4-Channel separation on this one, but the Surround Sound is actually pretty good, and all 5.1 Channels are used.  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD]  YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and a little less distortion than previous releases.  * * *  THE PLANETS 1976  THE PLANETS - ULTIMATE EDITION 2011 [SACD - DSD 4.1 Surround]  YES! Finally!  True Quadraphonic for the first time ever for some of us!  Extraordinary Discrete 4-Channel separation on my surround system.  Ultra clean, pure and bright with deep bass.  The cleanest of the SACDs!  THE PLANETS - ULTIMATE EDITION 2011 [SACD Hybrid - Regular CD tracks]  YES This CD is the brightest and cleanest of all the regular CD tracks of THE PLANETS.  [2016 & 2012 blu-spec CD2, 2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and less distortion than previous releases.  * * *  KOSMOS 1978  Note that this is the ONLY Tomita CD that is better on the Dolby Surround release.  [1991 Dolby Surround CD]  YES There is no extremely Discrete 4-Channel separation on this one, but the Surround Sound is actually pretty good, and all 5.1 Channels are used.  This One TOMITA CD sounded best after manually choosing Dolby Pro Logic II.  Also, it is brighter and cleaner with more full range than the CD in Box Set.  SPACE FANTASY 2015 (NOT an ULTIMATE EDITION of KOSMOS) [SACD] OPTIONAL CD 1 has amazing Quadraphonic sound, but several tracks are missing. CD 2 is just Stereo, and only 22:05 long.  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD]  NO More tape hiss and a little sharp with too much midrange.  * * *  THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 1979  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES! Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and a little less distortion than previous releases.  * * *  BOLERO or DAPHNIS AND CHLOE 1980 (Ravel)  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES! Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and a little less distortion than previous releases.  OKHOTSK FANTASY 2016 (NOT an ULTIMATE EDITION of THE RAVEL ALBUM) [SACD] OPTIONAL No DAPHNIS AND CHLOE.  * * *  THE GRAND CANYON 1982 (Grofe)  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and a little less distortion than previous releases.  * * *  CANON OF THE THREE STARS or DAWN CHORUS 1984 (various)  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and a little less distortion than previous releases.  * * *  LIVE AT LINZ, AUSTRIA 1984 - THE MIND OF THE UNIVERSE  This is the only TOMITA CD that got THREE completely different releases a long time ago...  THE BEST ONE IS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE (RCA Records RCD1-5461)  YES [1985 U.S. CD Made In Japan (70:31) Black front and back.] Starts with Also Sprach Zarathustra.  Has Saturn and Mars. Very clean and bright, as if mastered from original master tapes.  Sound quality almost exactly the same as 1991 Japan Import.  Make sure you get exactly this one with this number: RCD1-5461.  UNUSUAL, EXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE (BMG Japan BVCC 2512)  OK [1991 Japan CD. Gold front. Pink back.] Starts with Unanswered Question and announcements in Austrian. No Mars or Saturn. Very clean and bright, as if mastered from original master tapes. Sound quality almost exactly the same as the 1985 U.S. release.  EXCESSIVE TAPE HISS (BMG Japan BVCC 37514)  NO [2006 Japan CD. Gold front and back AND the CD in the Box Set (70:13)] Starts with Also Sprach Zarathustra.  Has Saturn and Mars. Dull music and Tape Hiss all the way through, as if mastered from a cassette. Note that with identical content, this 2006 Import and the CD in the Box Set are both 18 seconds shorter than the 1985 U.S. release, supporting the theory that this release was mastered from a cassette.  * * *  LIVE IN NEW YORK 1988 - BACK TO THE EARTH  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and less distortion than previous releases.  * * *  BACH FANTASY 1996 (J.S. Bach)  YES  There was only one Bach Fantasy release, and it is sparkling clean, bright, and deep.  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  MORE ABOUT QUADRAPHONIC SOUND  SURROUND SOUND Sound effects and reverb (echo) that you occasionally hear in the rear channels.  QUADRAPHONIC Totally different from Surround Sound:  Whether listening to an orchestra, a band, synthesizers, or nature sounds, a Quadraphonic recording is Discrete 4 Channel Sound that puts the instruments or sounds separately, but at equal levels, into all 4 speakers around you all the time.  Note:  An old mixtape recorded in Quadraphonic does not become Surround Sound just because you are playing it on a Surround System.  The above definitions apply no matter what.  THE POPULARITY OF DIFFERENT SACDs I think I know why SACDs never became popular First, they can only be played on a blu-ray player that plays SACDs.  And even if a person already has a player that can play SACDs, and it is connected to a Surround System in the living room where Quadraphonic music would be perfect, most SACDs only have a little bit of reverb in the rear channels, so they don't take advantage of that perfect set up.  Now that I have heard TOMITAs SACDs though, I want to try Quadraphonic SACDs and DVD Audios in other genres.  But time and time again, I find that true Quadraphonic discs are very expensive, while the price of most SACDs with nothing in the rear channels is WAY down. What does THAT tell you??  QUADRAPHONIC ON A BUDGET If you're like me and never heard true Quadraphonic sound from a music mixtape before these TOMITA SACDs... Now you have to!  And you can do it on a budget! On Amazon do a search for blu-ray player sacd in electronics, and choose 4 Stars under Avg. Customer Review (on the left)...  Then do the same kind of search for receiver 5.1... Then search for the best you found for a good price and...  When buying used, make sure you can return the item, and test it right after receiving it.  If there are no HDMI connections on one component, thats OK.  Just make sure the blu-ray player and receiver have the same kind of output and input for Digital Sound, whether its Optical or RCA Coax...  Then add a good pair of speakers at ear level behind you, and a subwoofer.  Then connect the speakers with thick enough wires.  Then set your Receiver or Surround Decoder to auto detect the surround encoding, or set it to DSD, and be amazed!  When Quadraphonic sound began, 4 large speakers were required and were usually placed in the 4 corners of the room with the listener in the center of the room.  Surround (Rear) Speakers these days are typically smaller, so its best when SACDs use the Subwoofer, and Tomitas SACDs do.  * * *  ON PRODUCING JVC K2 CDs (2004, 2006, and 2007) The source material was first converted to digital via JVC's patented K2 24-bit \/ 96kHz analog-to-digital converter, which uses advanced dither algorithms (without noise shaping). The musical information is next encoded on a magneto-optical disk for transport to JVC's Yokohama manufacturing plant. The musical signal on the disk is down-converted to 16-bit through a K2 \"super-coding\" process before going through a proprietary \"Extended Pit Cut\" DVD K2 laser technology to produce a glass master. This optimizes the linear velocity of the glass master, giving precise pit lengths to eliminate time jitters, controlled by an extremely precise Rubidium Clock. All CDs are finally stamped directly from this glass master.  These CDs are noticeably THICKER than the average music CD is now.  * * * * * * * * * * * * *  IN CONCLUSION Other reviewers on Amazon have done a more eloquent job than I of describing TOMITA's amazing musical style, but I have enjoyed creating this guide.  I hope you enjoyed it too.  Im flattered that this was copied and pasted to so many websites, but I would like you to know that I Am the original author.  Check the dates.  I first posted this on Amazon in March 2002. Thank You so much.  And THANK YOU MR. TOMITA! There is no collection of music I enjoy more.  Not even close.  Jeff Nielson, Modesto, CA","2528":"Why?  I don't know.  The GRAND CANYON cut is one of the shortest in any genre.  Anyway, it seems that this GREATEST HITS CD of Tomita's is the only place where the Syncopated Clock exists any more.  I think that's the only Tomita track that happened to.  Find out much more about Tomita's albums below...  May 2017  Major Update!  CLASSICAL TOMITA GUIDE with REVIEWS  In TOMITA's music I have found serene beauty, relaxation, landscapes of wonder, mysterious spaces, thrilling excitement, fascinating dimensions, inspiration, and some fun.  The music he creates is more natural, mellow, and rich, with more depth, color, imagery, feeling, and thought than any other synthesized music I have ever heard.  He makes classical music come alive, with never before seen, heard, or felt images and sounds.  As a person who began collecting TOMITA and other electronic music when I was 18 in 1978, plus the original symphony orchestra versions of the classical music that TOMITA used, I hope you consider me qualified to create the following list of TOMITA albums and review them as well. Thank you all so much for the votes.  Scroll down for the IMPORTANT and HELPFUL SOUND QUALITY COMPARISON BUYERS GUIDE, and more about Quadraphonic.  SACD NOTE The SACDs say DSD 4.0 on the cover, but they show DSD 5.1 when playing, and they DO use the Subwoofer, but NOT the Front Center Speaker, so they are actually 4.1, and that is perfect. (I just double-checked.  That is accurate.)  * * *  MUSIC REVIEWS  SNOWFLAKES ARE DANCING 1974 (Debussy) (11 Debussy pieces) I love the range of styles in this cut, the relaxing beauty, the depth of colors.  The Snowflakes cut is very enjoyable; one of the few CDs that I listen to again and again.  To me, SNOWFLAKES is in TOMITA's top three.  The newly remastered HIGH PERFORMANCE CD from 2000 is 24\/96 Audiophile Quality on any player, and adds Prelude To The Afternoon of a Faun, also by Debussy.  CLAIR DE LUNE - ULTIMATE EDITION 2012 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) Finally! A New TOMITA CD!!  And it is superb. It adds the never before released Second Arabesque (which is delightful fun as it should be), Whistle and Chime (The Art of Sound Creation), and Nauges.  This QUADRAPHONIC SACD is a completely new experience. Several of the original tracks feature new and different mixes by Mr. TOMITA.  Prelude To The Afternoon Of A Faun is missing, but this is a great new cut!  * * *  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION 1975 (Mussorgsky) For this cut (also in the top 3) TOMITA created some of the most unusual, high quality electronic sounds ever heard. Then he used these sounds very effectively in some amazing orchestrations. The listening is as enjoyable as it is bizarre, quite an accomplishment in itself. (Unlike other synthesized music, I have never gotten a headache listening to this or any other TOMITA recording.  Not even close.  Not even when playing his music loud, which I love to do.)  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION - ULTIMATE EDITION 2014 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) (Moussorgsky: PICTURES. Rimsky-Korsakov: SCHEHERAZADE- excerpt of Part I. Bach-TOMITA: Sea Named Solaris- excerpt).  Finally!!  For the first time ever, one of the most amazing Quadraphonic albums ever produced in magnificent Discrete 4-Channel Quadraphonic Sound!!!  * * *  FIREBIRD 1976 (various) (Stravinsky: FIREBIRD SUITE. Debussy: Prelude To The Afternoon of A Faun. Mussorgsky: Night On Bare Mountain.)  FIREBIRD is one of TOMITA's best albums. The Round of the Princesses is beautiful. The Infernal Dance of King Kastchei is exciting, scary, and LOUD - much more so than any performance by any orchestra. The Finale is so awesome; TOMITA played it at the end of his live concerts.  * * *  THE PLANETS 1976 (Holst) THE PLANETS is a completely different mood for TOMITA, but he did a fantastic job on it.  Each time I hear any part of THE PLANETS performed by Symphony Orchestra, it sounds very two-dimensional and just falls flat compared to TOMITAs.  It is as if Holst composed THE PLANETS for TOMITA, even though the Holst family would not allow this cut to be released in England. They didn't like that Uranus and Neptune were abridged, but the blending and poignant ending are pure genius, even more so in the new SACD...  THE PLANETS - ULTIMATE EDITION 2011 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) This New QUADRAPHONIC PLANETS cut on SACD has a nice long new Introduction with Control Room, Spaceship Interior, Pre-Launch Communications, and beginning of Mars that knocked my socks off!  Theres even a brand new track called Itokawa and Hayabusa about the exploration of the Asteroid Belt between Jupiter and Saturn.  The whole new PLANETS cut is just astounding. The Discrete 4-Channel Sound is phenomenal.  I couldn't have been more surprised, amazed, and delighted.  * * *  KOSMOS or COSMOS 1978 (various) (Star Wars Title. Space Fantasy - R. Strauss: Thus Spake Zarathustra, Wagner: Ride of The Valkyries and Tannhauser Overture. Honnegar: Pacific 231. Ives: Unanswered Question. Rodrigo: Aranjuez. Grieg: Solveig's Song. Dinicu-Heifetz: Hora Staccato. Bach-TOMITA: The Sea Named Solaris.)  A Science Fiction cut without a theme, and quite a variety of experiences...  In this cut:  Star Wars is cute.  The Space Fantasy awesome and exhilerating.  Pacific 231 exciting and fun, a quality piece.  You can see and feel the mechanical motions of the locomotive flying through space after the train speeds up, leaves the tracks and goes to another dimension...  TOMITA's interpretation of the mystery and solitude of The Unanswered Question is far better than any orchestral performance.  Hora Staccato is lots of fun.  And Carl Sagan respected the amazing Sea Named Solaris so much, that he used it in his COSMOS. All TOMITA fans and collectors should enjoy most of this CD.  SPACE FANTASY 2015 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) Tomita was 83 when he re-arranged and re-mixed his KOSMOS cut for SACD.  I think its remarkable that he was still working, but I feel I must reluctantly share why you may want to skip this one...  1.  No Thus Spake Zarathustra (the 2001 Movie Theme) which had worked so well at the beginning of his Space Fantasy piece on KOSMOS. 2.  No Sea Named Solaris because 5:19 of the original 12:26 was on The PICTURES SACD. 3.  Two random tracks from THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE indicates that it may never have its own Quadraphonic SACD release.  (Someone please re-release the entire Bermuda Triangle in Quadraphonic on SACD.  It is my all time favorite cut from any genre.) 4.  On CD 2 we have some never before heard tracks from Walt Disneys FANTASIA, but with only one part from THE PASTORAL SYMPHONY, three parts from THE NUTRACKER SUITE, and no Dance Of The Hours or RITE OF SPRING... The whole CD is only 22:05 long. 5.  The Waltz of The Flowers fades abruptly a full minute before its done.  * * *  THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 1979 - A MUSICAL FANTASY of SCIENCE FICTION (Sibelius: Valse Triste. Williams: Close Encounters. Prokofiev: Romeo and Juliet, Scythian Suite, Symphonies 5 and 6, Violin Concerto 1.)  After nearly 30 years of listening to THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE off and on, I have decided that it is my all time favorite record cut, CD, concept cut, and my all time favorite synthesized music.  Inexplicably, the U.S. Dolby Surround CD releases stopped with KOSMOS. THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE is much better than KOSMOS. I could type pages on THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE, and you can find many pages on various websites.  But I will just say that the orchestrations and performances of the music itself all fit together masterfully to tell a story that is part thrilling Science Fiction and part Impressionistic Dream.  I especially like the second half - the exceptional, exciting Prokofiev music. The sounds TOMITA created for this cut are his most sophisticated and fascinating yet (maybe ever). The quality of the recording is bright, full, deep, clear, and clean. The whole experience is extraordinary. I am so grateful the cut is on CD.  Another reviewer is absolutely right...  Turn off the lights, put the phone on silent, turn the volume way up, and sit down and listen!  Really listen!!  Because THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE is an Experience: A Phenomenal, Powerful, Enlightening, Enjoyable Experience!!  * * *  DAPHNIS AND CHLOE or BOLERO or THE RAVEL ALBUM 1980 (Ravel) (Ravel: DAPHNIS AND CHLOE, Pavane for A Dead Princess, Bolero, MOTHER GOOSE SUITE.)  This is a very good cut with the best performance of THE MOTHER GOOSE SUITE that I have heard, by far.  I love the range of musical styles in it.  You can actually hear the fairies in the Fairy Garden (they sound like hummingbirds).  Plus, this DAPHNIS AND CHLOE is better than some orchestral performances.  OKHOTSK FANTASY 2016 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) Many of us Tomita fans wondered why he put a mono recording of an old cartoon on the OKHOTSK FANTASY cut, instead of doing a DAPHNIS AND CHLOE - ULTIMATE EDITION in discrete 4.1 channel Quadraphonic sound... Now it is clear, the OKHOTSK FANTASY cut was his last.  It was released in March 2016, and he passed away two months later.  So he probably wasn't able to finish it.  Knowing this, we can wish that he had started putting his Quadraphonic albums on SACD sooner, but we cant blame him for the last two SACDs, because he was 83 and 84 when he did them.  So, there is no DAPHNIS AND CHLOE SUITE on this SACD.  But thankfully, the entire MOTHER GOOSE SUITE is on this cut with spectacular Quadraphonic sound. The Fairy Garden is just unbelievable in Quadraphonic.  (Please RCA or Denon:  Remix and release Ultimate Edition SACDs of ALL of Tomitas wonderful Quadraphonic Classical Albums with complete FIREBIRD SUITE, DAPHNIS AND CHLOE, GRAND CANYON, and the complete BERMUDA TRIANGLE in 4.1 Surround on SACD.)  * * *  THE GRAND CANYON 1982 (Grofe) (Bonus track: Syncopated Clock by Leroy Anderson is not on the Japan Import CD.)  The average music critic might say that this performance of THE GRAND CANYON Suite is not as good as a symphony orchestra's. But it is worth checking out, as parts of it are far more colorful, magical, and entertaining than any symphony orchestra version I have ever heard. TOMITA's Painted Desert gives a feeling of flying low over vast mysterious, enchanted, moonlit sands. On The Trail is a lot of fun, although some orchestra performances may be a bit better. And the Thunderstorm is exhilarating and even a little frightening, especially when turned up Loud. You can actually HEAR the Lightning, FEEL the Thunder, and then SEE a Rainbow at the end. Only TOMITA could do that!!  This is the shortest TOMITA cut. It would easily fit on a CD with CANON OF THE THREE STARS.  * * *  CANON OF THE THREE STARS or DAWN CHORUS 1984 (various) (Pachelbel: Canon. Rachmaninoff: Vocalise. Albinoni: Adagio. Bach: Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring. Three movements from Villa Lobos: BACHIANAS BRASILEIRAS Suites 2, 4, and 7.)  Sweet is the word I would use to describe pretty much this whole cut. Some tracks are even cute, although at least one is solemn and another poignant.  The quality of this cut is not nearly as great as his early albums...  It almost seems that TOMITA did this one in his sleep, but some tracks are very good, and since all the tracks are individual pieces, it is very worth owning as a reference CD.  * * *  LIVE AT LINZ, AUSTRIA 1984 - THE MIND OF THE UNIVERSE (various) (Live concert with huge speakers on both sides of the Danube River. Includes 7 pieces from previous albums- some with new arrangements and Live Soloists.  Plus 5 Totally New Pieces...  Stravinsky: Dance of the Young Girls from THE RITE OF SPRING. Japanese Traditional: Cranes In Their Nest.  Vaughn Williams: The Lark Ascending.  Wagner: TRISTAN UND ISOLDE  Liebestod.  Beethoven: ODE TO JOY with full Choir and soloists.)  In my opinion, this is in TOMITA's top five best albums. It contains some of the most beautiful and unique performances ever put on a disk. The live violin solo (Mariko Senju) of The Lark Ascending at least equals the best performance I ever heard. The same violinist does an outstanding job on Prokofiev's VIOLIN CONCERTO NO. 1.  This is the part of THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE near the end that gets so exciting, and with the live violinist and TOMITA's magical orchestral creations, it is truly one of the most thrilling musical experiences I have ever enjoyed.  I also love the Wagner: TRISTAN UND ISOLDE  Liebestod (which first appeared on this cut).  So much depth and feeling, it is hard to describe how lovely it is.  This cut also has an extended version of Cranes In Their Nest (probably because it is also on the Voyager Interstellar Record) a very good performance by Goro Yamaguchi on the Shakuhachi (a Japanese end-blown flute made of bamboo).  Of the two concert CDs, this one has more awe-inspiring moments, and more depth. It is also the longest TOMITA cut ever made, which is nice, since it is so enjoyable.  Note on LIVE AT LINZ Recording Quality I think that since MIND OF THE UNIVERSE was a live concert with speakers on both sides of the Danube River, a helicopter carrying a speaker above for a UFO effect, and a huge choir on a boat ...  there is no way the sound quality could have been perfect.  TOMITA's mixing choices could have been a bit better but even though I am particular about sound quality, I do enjoy listening to this CD very much.  And when I play my old 1985 Domestic Release CD (made in Japan with a black cover) Loud on my car sound system, it sounds great to me. The most important parts are clean.  There is reverb at times, but it is natural, bouncing off things in the area.  I have always given this one cut more slack, because the oddities that occur make me FEEL as if I am at the Live Concert, and for me this is a plus.  * * *  LIVE IN NEW YORK 1988 - BACK TO THE EARTH (various) (Live concert with live soloists. Includes 7 pieces from previous albums- some with new arrangements and live soloists.  Plus Dukas: Fanfare. Mahler: SYMPHONY 3 IN D MINOR  5th Movement. Traditional: Chinese War Lord Going Home. Gershwin: Rhapsody In Blue. Fisher-Dvorak: Goin' Home.)  LIVE IN NY is almost as good as the LIVE AT LINZ concert (above).  Parts of it are great.  And the music is less demanding than LIVE AT LINZ, which makes it more suited for playing in the background.  These last two CDs are my all time favorite live concert albums.  * * *  BACH FANTASY 1996 (J.S. Bach) 10 separate Bach pieces, which include only two tracks from previous albums, and part of The Sea Named Solaris is mixed different.  Too bad this is hard to find and was not included in the big Box Set, but you CAN find it used on Amazon Japan, and G..... Chrome translates automatically, then with a little perseverance, you can figure out how to order from a seller who says they ship internationally.  Once I figured it out, it was easy, a great price, and in perfect condition.  This CD features some new sounds, moods, and musical styles for TOMITA Classical - a really wide variety of them.  Several of the tracks are most enjoyable. The popular Toccata and Fugue is a very good, virtuoso straight performance on very cool sounding Synth Organ (which I normally would not appreciate, but TOMITA gets away with it splendidly).  My subwoofer liked it too!  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  SOUND QUALITY COMPARISONS OF MOST RELEASES WITH RECOMMENDATIONS  HOW I COMPARED THE SOUND QUALITY OF VARIOUS CD RELEASES Listening with Beyerdynamic DT990 Studio Headphones plugged into my Mac Pro, I played tracks from each pair of CDs using QuickTime Player 7 opened in two windows, and a keyboard command to switch back and forth (many times) for the comparisons.  I compared the SACDs and Surround CDs on my Surround System in the living room.  * * *  SACD NOTE The SACDs say DSD 4.0 on the cover, but they show DSD 5.1 when playing, and they DO use the Subwoofer, but NOT the Front Center Speaker, so they are actually 4.1, and that is perfect.

In fact, after waiting decades to hear this cut in 4-Channel Sound, the Ballet of The Chicks in Their Shells and The Great Gate at Kiev are incredibly stunning.  And of course, the DSD tracks are very clean, pure and bright with deep bass.  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and a little less distortion than previous releases.

This One TOMITA CD sounded best after manually choosing Dolby Pro Logic II.  Also, it is brighter and cleaner with more full range than the CD in Box Set.  SPACE FANTASY 2015 (NOT an ULTIMATE EDITION of KOSMOS) [SACD] OPTIONAL CD 1 has amazing Quadraphonic sound, but several tracks are missing. CD 2 is just Stereo, and only 22:05 long.

THE BEST ONE IS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE (RCA Records RCD1-5461)  YES [1985 U.S. CD Made In Japan (70:31) Black front and back.] Starts with Also Sprach Zarathustra.  Has Saturn and Mars. Very clean and bright, as if mastered from original master tapes.  Sound quality almost exactly the same as 1991 Japan Import.  Make sure you get exactly this one with this number: RCD1-5461.  UNUSUAL, EXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE (BMG Japan BVCC 2512)  OK [1991 Japan CD. Gold front. Pink back.] Starts with Unanswered Question and announcements in Austrian. No Mars or Saturn.

Gold front and back AND the CD in the Box Set (70:13)] Starts with Also Sprach Zarathustra.  Has Saturn and Mars. Dull music and Tape Hiss all the way through, as if mastered from a cassette. Note that with identical content, this 2006 Import and the CD in the Box Set are both 18 seconds shorter than the 1985 U.S. release, supporting the theory that this release was mastered from a cassette.  * * *  LIVE IN NEW YORK 1988 - BACK TO THE EARTH  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and less distortion than previous releases.  * * *  BACH FANTASY 1996 (J.S.

QUADRAPHONIC Totally different from Surround Sound:  Whether listening to an orchestra, a band, synthesizers, or nature sounds, a Quadraphonic recording is Discrete 4 Channel Sound that puts the instruments or sounds separately, but at equal levels, into all 4 speakers around you all the time.  Note:  An old cut recorded in Quadraphonic does not become Surround Sound just because you are playing it on a Surround System.  The above definitions apply no matter what.  THE POPULARITY OF DIFFERENT SACDs I think I know why SACDs never became popular First, they can only be played on a blu-ray player that plays SACDs.  And even if a person already has a player that can play SACDs, and it is connected to a Surround System in the living room where Quadraphonic music would be perfect, most SACDs only have a little bit of reverb in the rear channels, so they don't take advantage of that perfect set up.  Now that I have heard TOMITAs SACDs though, I want to try Quadraphonic SACDs and DVD Audios in other genres.  But time and time again, I find that true Quadraphonic discs are very expensive, while the price of most SACDs with nothing in the rear channels is WAY down. What does THAT tell you??  QUADRAPHONIC ON A BUDGET If you're like me and never heard true Quadraphonic sound from a music cut before these TOMITA SACDs... Now you have to!  And you can do it on a budget! On Amazon do a search for blu-ray player sacd in electronics, and choose 4 Stars under Avg. Customer Review (on the left)...  Then do the same kind of search for receiver 5.1... Then search for the best you found for a good price and...  When buying used, make sure you can return the item, and test it right after receiving it.  If there are no HDMI connections on one component, thats OK.  Just make sure the blu-ray player and receiver have the same kind of output and input for Digital Sound, whether its Optical or RCA Coax...  Then add a good pair of speakers at ear level behind you, and a subwoofer.  Then connect the speakers with thick enough wires.  Then set your Receiver or Surround Decoder to auto detect the surround encoding, or set it to DSD, and be amazed!  When Quadraphonic sound began, 4 large speakers were required and were usually placed in the 4 corners of the room with the listener in the center of the room.  Surround (Rear) Speakers these days are typically smaller, so its best when SACDs use the Subwoofer, and Tomitas SACDs do.  * * *  ON PRODUCING JVC K2 CDs (2004, 2006, and 2007) The source material was first converted to digital via JVC's patented K2 24-bit \/ 96kHz analog-to-digital converter, which uses advanced dither algorithms (without noise shaping). The musical information is next encoded on a magneto-optical disk for transport to JVC's Yokohama manufacturing plant. The musical signal on the disk is down-converted to 16-bit through a K2 \"super-coding\" process before going through a proprietary \"Extended Pit Cut\" DVD K2 laser technology to produce a glass master. This optimizes the linear velocity of the glass master, giving precise pit lengths to eliminate time jitters, controlled by an extremely precise Rubidium Clock. All CDs are finally stamped directly from this glass master.  These CDs are noticeably THICKER than the average music CD is now.  * * * * * * * * * * * * *  IN CONCLUSION Other reviewers on Amazon have done a more eloquent job than I of describing TOMITA's amazing musical style, but I have enjoyed creating this guide.  I hope you enjoyed it too.  Im flattered that this was copied and pasted to so many websites, but I would like you to know that I Am the original author.  Check the dates.  I first posted this on Amazon in March 2002. Thank You so much.  And THANK YOU MR. TOMITA! There is no collection of music I enjoy more.  Not even close.  Jeff Nielson, Modesto, CA","2529":"... Anyway, if you'd like to know more about the music this cassette came from, check this out...  May 2017  Major Update!  CLASSICAL TOMITA GUIDE with REVIEWS  In TOMITA's music I have found serene beauty, relaxation, landscapes of wonder, mysterious spaces, thrilling excitement, fascinating dimensions, inspiration, and some fun.  The music he creates is more natural, mellow, and rich, with more depth, color, imagery, feeling, and thought than any other synthesized music I have ever heard.  He makes classical music come alive, with never before seen, heard, or felt images and sounds.  As a person who began collecting TOMITA and other electronic music when I was 18 in 1978, plus the original symphony orchestra versions of the classical music that TOMITA used, I hope you consider me qualified to create the following list of TOMITA albums and review them as well. Thank you all so much for the votes.  Scroll down for the IMPORTANT and HELPFUL SOUND QUALITY COMPARISON BUYERS GUIDE, and more about Quadraphonic.  SACD NOTE The SACDs say DSD 4.0 on the cover, but they show DSD 5.1 when playing, and they DO use the Subwoofer, but NOT the Front Center Speaker, so they are actually 4.1, and that is perfect. (I just double-checked.  That is accurate.)  * * *  MUSIC REVIEWS  SNOWFLAKES ARE DANCING 1974 (Debussy) (11 Debussy pieces) I love the range of styles in this tune, the relaxing beauty, the depth of colors.  The Snowflakes tune is very enjoyable; one of the few CDs that I listen to again and again.  To me, SNOWFLAKES is in TOMITA's top three.  The newly remastered HIGH PERFORMANCE CD from 2000 is 24\/96 Audiophile Quality on any player, and adds Prelude To The Afternoon of a Faun, also by Debussy.  CLAIR DE LUNE - ULTIMATE EDITION 2012 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) Finally! A New TOMITA CD!!  And it is superb. It adds the never before released Second Arabesque (which is delightful fun as it should be), Whistle and Chime (The Art of Sound Creation), and Nauges.  This QUADRAPHONIC SACD is a completely new experience. Several of the original tracks feature new and different mixes by Mr. TOMITA.  Prelude To The Afternoon Of A Faun is missing, but this is a great new tune!  * * *  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION 1975 (Mussorgsky) For this tune (also in the top 3) TOMITA created some of the most unusual, high quality electronic sounds ever heard. Then he used these sounds very effectively in some amazing orchestrations. The listening is as enjoyable as it is bizarre, quite an accomplishment in itself. (Unlike other synthesized music, I have never gotten a headache listening to this or any other TOMITA recording.  Not even close.  Not even when playing his music loud, which I love to do.)  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION - ULTIMATE EDITION 2014 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) (Moussorgsky: PICTURES. Rimsky-Korsakov: SCHEHERAZADE- excerpt of Part I. Bach-TOMITA: Sea Named Solaris- excerpt).  Finally!!  For the first time ever, one of the most amazing Quadraphonic albums ever produced in magnificent Discrete 4-Channel Quadraphonic Sound!!!  * * *  FIREBIRD 1976 (various) (Stravinsky: FIREBIRD SUITE. Debussy: Prelude To The Afternoon of A Faun. Mussorgsky: Night On Bare Mountain.)  FIREBIRD is one of TOMITA's best albums. The Round of the Princesses is beautiful. The Infernal Dance of King Kastchei is exciting, scary, and LOUD - much more so than any performance by any orchestra. The Finale is so awesome; TOMITA played it at the end of his live concerts.  * * *  THE PLANETS 1976 (Holst) THE PLANETS is a completely different mood for TOMITA, but he did a fantastic job on it.  Each time I hear any part of THE PLANETS performed by Symphony Orchestra, it sounds very two-dimensional and just falls flat compared to TOMITAs.  It is as if Holst composed THE PLANETS for TOMITA, even though the Holst family would not allow this tune to be released in England. They didn't like that Uranus and Neptune were abridged, but the blending and poignant ending are pure genius, even more so in the new SACD...  THE PLANETS - ULTIMATE EDITION 2011 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) This New QUADRAPHONIC PLANETS tune on SACD has a nice long new Introduction with Control Room, Spaceship Interior, Pre-Launch Communications, and beginning of Mars that knocked my socks off!  Theres even a brand new track called Itokawa and Hayabusa about the exploration of the Asteroid Belt between Jupiter and Saturn.  The whole new PLANETS tune is just astounding. The Discrete 4-Channel Sound is phenomenal.  I couldn't have been more surprised, amazed, and delighted.  * * *  KOSMOS or COSMOS 1978 (various) (Star Wars Title. Space Fantasy - R. Strauss: Thus Spake Zarathustra, Wagner: Ride of The Valkyries and Tannhauser Overture. Honnegar: Pacific 231. Ives: Unanswered Question. Rodrigo: Aranjuez. Grieg: Solveig's Song. Dinicu-Heifetz: Hora Staccato. Bach-TOMITA: The Sea Named Solaris.)  A Science Fiction tune without a theme, and quite a variety of experiences...  In this tune:  Star Wars is cute.  The Space Fantasy awesome and exhilerating.  Pacific 231 exciting and fun, a quality piece.  You can see and feel the mechanical motions of the locomotive flying through space after the train speeds up, leaves the tracks and goes to another dimension...  TOMITA's interpretation of the mystery and solitude of The Unanswered Question is far better than any orchestral performance.  Hora Staccato is lots of fun.  And Carl Sagan respected the amazing Sea Named Solaris so much, that he used it in his COSMOS. All TOMITA fans and collectors should enjoy most of this CD.  SPACE FANTASY 2015 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) Tomita was 83 when he re-arranged and re-mixed his KOSMOS tune for SACD.  I think its remarkable that he was still working, but I feel I must reluctantly share why you may want to skip this one...  1.  No Thus Spake Zarathustra (the 2001 Movie Theme) which had worked so well at the beginning of his Space Fantasy piece on KOSMOS. 2.  No Sea Named Solaris because 5:19 of the original 12:26 was on The PICTURES SACD. 3.  Two random tracks from THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE indicates that it may never have its own Quadraphonic SACD release.  (Someone please re-release the entire Bermuda Triangle in Quadraphonic on SACD.  It is my all time favorite tune from any genre.) 4.  On CD 2 we have some never before heard tracks from Walt Disneys FANTASIA, but with only one part from THE PASTORAL SYMPHONY, three parts from THE NUTRACKER SUITE, and no Dance Of The Hours or RITE OF SPRING... The whole CD is only 22:05 long. 5.  The Waltz of The Flowers fades abruptly a full minute before its done.  * * *  THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 1979 - A MUSICAL FANTASY of SCIENCE FICTION (Sibelius: Valse Triste. Williams: Close Encounters. Prokofiev: Romeo and Juliet, Scythian Suite, Symphonies 5 and 6, Violin Concerto 1.)  After nearly 30 years of listening to THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE off and on, I have decided that it is my all time favorite record tune, CD, concept tune, and my all time favorite synthesized music.  Inexplicably, the U.S. Dolby Surround CD releases stopped with KOSMOS. THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE is much better than KOSMOS. I could type pages on THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE, and you can find many pages on various websites.  But I will just say that the orchestrations and performances of the music itself all fit together masterfully to tell a story that is part thrilling Science Fiction and part Impressionistic Dream.  I especially like the second half - the exceptional, exciting Prokofiev music. The sounds TOMITA created for this tune are his most sophisticated and fascinating yet (maybe ever). The quality of the recording is bright, full, deep, clear, and clean. The whole experience is extraordinary. I am so grateful the tune is on CD.  Another reviewer is absolutely right...  Turn off the lights, put the phone on silent, turn the volume way up, and sit down and listen!  Really listen!!  Because THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE is an Experience: A Phenomenal, Powerful, Enlightening, Enjoyable Experience!!  * * *  DAPHNIS AND CHLOE or BOLERO or THE RAVEL ALBUM 1980 (Ravel) (Ravel: DAPHNIS AND CHLOE, Pavane for A Dead Princess, Bolero, MOTHER GOOSE SUITE.)  This is a very good tune with the best performance of THE MOTHER GOOSE SUITE that I have heard, by far.  I love the range of musical styles in it.  You can actually hear the fairies in the Fairy Garden (they sound like hummingbirds).  Plus, this DAPHNIS AND CHLOE is better than some orchestral performances.  OKHOTSK FANTASY 2016 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) Many of us Tomita fans wondered why he put a mono recording of an old cartoon on the OKHOTSK FANTASY tune, instead of doing a DAPHNIS AND CHLOE - ULTIMATE EDITION in discrete 4.1 channel Quadraphonic sound... Now it is clear, the OKHOTSK FANTASY tune was his last.  It was released in March 2016, and he passed away two months later.  So he probably wasn't able to finish it.  Knowing this, we can wish that he had started putting his Quadraphonic albums on SACD sooner, but we cant blame him for the last two SACDs, because he was 83 and 84 when he did them.  So, there is no DAPHNIS AND CHLOE SUITE on this SACD.  But thankfully, the entire MOTHER GOOSE SUITE is on this tune with spectacular Quadraphonic sound. The Fairy Garden is just unbelievable in Quadraphonic.  (Please RCA or Denon:  Remix and release Ultimate Edition SACDs of ALL of Tomitas wonderful Quadraphonic Classical Albums with complete FIREBIRD SUITE, DAPHNIS AND CHLOE, GRAND CANYON, and the complete BERMUDA TRIANGLE in 4.1 Surround on SACD.)  * * *  THE GRAND CANYON 1982 (Grofe) (Bonus track: Syncopated Clock by Leroy Anderson is not on the Japan Import CD.)  The average music critic might say that this performance of THE GRAND CANYON Suite is not as good as a symphony orchestra's. But it is worth checking out, as parts of it are far more colorful, magical, and entertaining than any symphony orchestra version I have ever heard. TOMITA's Painted Desert gives a feeling of flying low over vast mysterious, enchanted, moonlit sands. On The Trail is a lot of fun, although some orchestra performances may be a bit better. And the Thunderstorm is exhilarating and even a little frightening, especially when turned up Loud. You can actually HEAR the Lightning, FEEL the Thunder, and then SEE a Rainbow at the end. Only TOMITA could do that!!  This is the shortest TOMITA tune. It would easily fit on a CD with CANON OF THE THREE STARS.  * * *  CANON OF THE THREE STARS or DAWN CHORUS 1984 (various) (Pachelbel: Canon. Rachmaninoff: Vocalise. Albinoni: Adagio. Bach: Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring. Three movements from Villa Lobos: BACHIANAS BRASILEIRAS Suites 2, 4, and 7.)  Sweet is the word I would use to describe pretty much this whole tune. Some tracks are even cute, although at least one is solemn and another poignant.  The quality of this tune is not nearly as great as his early albums...  It almost seems that TOMITA did this one in his sleep, but some tracks are very good, and since all the tracks are individual pieces, it is very worth owning as a reference CD.  * * *  LIVE AT LINZ, AUSTRIA 1984 - THE MIND OF THE UNIVERSE (various) (Live concert with huge speakers on both sides of the Danube River. Includes 7 pieces from previous albums- some with new arrangements and Live Soloists.  Plus 5 Totally New Pieces...  Stravinsky: Dance of the Young Girls from THE RITE OF SPRING. Japanese Traditional: Cranes In Their Nest.  Vaughn Williams: The Lark Ascending.  Wagner: TRISTAN UND ISOLDE  Liebestod.  Beethoven: ODE TO JOY with full Choir and soloists.)  In my opinion, this is in TOMITA's top five best albums. It contains some of the most beautiful and unique performances ever put on a disk. The live violin solo (Mariko Senju) of The Lark Ascending at least equals the best performance I ever heard. The same violinist does an outstanding job on Prokofiev's VIOLIN CONCERTO NO. 1.  This is the part of THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE near the end that gets so exciting, and with the live violinist and TOMITA's magical orchestral creations, it is truly one of the most thrilling musical experiences I have ever enjoyed.  I also love the Wagner: TRISTAN UND ISOLDE  Liebestod (which first appeared on this tune).  So much depth and feeling, it is hard to describe how lovely it is.  This tune also has an extended version of Cranes In Their Nest (probably because it is also on the Voyager Interstellar Record) a very good performance by Goro Yamaguchi on the Shakuhachi (a Japanese end-blown flute made of bamboo).  Of the two concert CDs, this one has more awe-inspiring moments, and more depth. It is also the longest TOMITA tune ever made, which is nice, since it is so enjoyable.  Note on LIVE AT LINZ Recording Quality I think that since MIND OF THE UNIVERSE was a live concert with speakers on both sides of the Danube River, a helicopter carrying a speaker above for a UFO effect, and a huge choir on a boat ...  there is no way the sound quality could have been perfect.  TOMITA's mixing choices could have been a bit better but even though I am particular about sound quality, I do enjoy listening to this CD very much.  And when I play my old 1985 Domestic Release CD (made in Japan with a black cover) Loud on my car sound system, it sounds great to me. The most important parts are clean.  There is reverb at times, but it is natural, bouncing off things in the area.  I have always given this one tune more slack, because the oddities that occur make me FEEL as if I am at the Live Concert, and for me this is a plus.  * * *  LIVE IN NEW YORK 1988 - BACK TO THE EARTH (various) (Live concert with live soloists. Includes 7 pieces from previous albums- some with new arrangements and live soloists.  Plus Dukas: Fanfare. Mahler: SYMPHONY 3 IN D MINOR  5th Movement. Traditional: Chinese War Lord Going Home. Gershwin: Rhapsody In Blue. Fisher-Dvorak: Goin' Home.)  LIVE IN NY is almost as good as the LIVE AT LINZ concert (above).  Parts of it are great.  And the music is less demanding than LIVE AT LINZ, which makes it more suited for playing in the background.  These last two CDs are my all time favorite live concert albums.  * * *  BACH FANTASY 1996 (J.S. Bach) 10 separate Bach pieces, which include only two tracks from previous albums, and part of The Sea Named Solaris is mixed different.  Too bad this is hard to find and was not included in the big Box Set, but you CAN find it used on Amazon Japan, and G.....

Once I figured it out, it was easy, a great price, and in perfect condition.  This CD features some new sounds, moods, and musical styles for TOMITA Classical - a really wide variety of them.  Several of the tracks are most enjoyable. The popular Toccata and Fugue is a very good, virtuoso straight performance on very cool sounding Synth Organ (which I normally would not appreciate, but TOMITA gets away with it splendidly).  My subwoofer liked it too!  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  SOUND QUALITY COMPARISONS OF MOST RELEASES WITH RECOMMENDATIONS  HOW I COMPARED THE SOUND QUALITY OF VARIOUS CD RELEASES Listening with Beyerdynamic DT990 Studio Headphones plugged into my Mac Pro, I played tracks from each pair of CDs using QuickTime Player 7 opened in two windows, and a keyboard command to switch back and forth (many times) for the comparisons.

QUADRAPHONIC Totally different from Surround Sound:  Whether listening to an orchestra, a band, synthesizers, or nature sounds, a Quadraphonic recording is Discrete 4 Channel Sound that puts the instruments or sounds separately, but at equal levels, into all 4 speakers around you all the time.  Note:  An old tune recorded in Quadraphonic does not become Surround Sound just because you are playing it on a Surround System.  The above definitions apply no matter what.  THE POPULARITY OF DIFFERENT SACDs I think I know why SACDs never became popular First, they can only be played on a blu-ray player that plays SACDs.  And even if a person already has a player that can play SACDs, and it is connected to a Surround System in the living room where Quadraphonic music would be perfect, most SACDs only have a little bit of reverb in the rear channels, so they don't take advantage of that perfect set up.  Now that I have heard TOMITAs SACDs though, I want to try Quadraphonic SACDs and DVD Audios in other genres.  But time and time again, I find that true Quadraphonic discs are very expensive, while the price of most SACDs with nothing in the rear channels is WAY down. What does THAT tell you??  QUADRAPHONIC ON A BUDGET If you're like me and never heard true Quadraphonic sound from a music tune before these TOMITA SACDs... Now you have to!  And you can do it on a budget! On Amazon do a search for blu-ray player sacd in electronics, and choose 4 Stars under Avg. Customer Review (on the left)...  Then do the same kind of search for receiver 5.1... Then search for the best you found for a good price and...  When buying used, make sure you can return the item, and test it right after receiving it.  If there are no HDMI connections on one component, thats OK.  Just make sure the blu-ray player and receiver have the same kind of output and input for Digital Sound, whether its Optical or RCA Coax...  Then add a good pair of speakers at ear level behind you, and a subwoofer.  Then connect the speakers with thick enough wires.  Then set your Receiver or Surround Decoder to auto detect the surround encoding, or set it to DSD, and be amazed!  When Quadraphonic sound began, 4 large speakers were required and were usually placed in the 4 corners of the room with the listener in the center of the room.  Surround (Rear) Speakers these days are typically smaller, so its best when SACDs use the Subwoofer, and Tomitas SACDs do.  * * *  ON PRODUCING JVC K2 CDs (2004, 2006, and 2007) The source material was first converted to digital via JVC's patented K2 24-bit \/ 96kHz analog-to-digital converter, which uses advanced dither algorithms (without noise shaping). The musical information is next encoded on a magneto-optical disk for transport to JVC's Yokohama manufacturing plant. The musical signal on the disk is down-converted to 16-bit through a K2 \"super-coding\" process before going through a proprietary \"Extended Pit Cut\" DVD K2 laser technology to produce a glass master. This optimizes the linear velocity of the glass master, giving precise pit lengths to eliminate time jitters, controlled by an extremely precise Rubidium Clock. All CDs are finally stamped directly from this glass master.  These CDs are noticeably THICKER than the average music CD is now.  * * * * * * * * * * * * *  IN CONCLUSION Other reviewers on Amazon have done a more eloquent job than I of describing TOMITA's amazing musical style, but I have enjoyed creating this guide.  I hope you enjoyed it too.  Im flattered that this was copied and pasted to so many websites, but I would like you to know that I Am the original author.  Check the dates.  I first posted this on Amazon in March 2002. Thank You so much.  And THANK YOU MR. TOMITA! There is no collection of music I enjoy more.  Not even close.  Jeff Nielson, Modesto, CA","2530":"If everyday you could jump on a plane and jet to any remote corner of the planet, if you searched hard enough and dug deep enough, you would be almost certain to find a QUALITY reggae artist wherever you landed.  And not only will that artist probably be of quality in terms of talent, but the reggae listening community in that area will hold him\/her in just about as high esteem as and in that particular area (ESPECIALLY if you happen to go to a smaller area) they will be just as popular as the more worldwide well known reggae act. And, its to my experience that it doesn't even matter particularly if the artist has bust to a worldwide community (or if they EVER end up doing so). I have to say, however, that this phenomenon is generally ONLY true outside of the (spoiled) Caribbean, where as we seemingly don't hold up and comers in as high of regard as they do internationally, thus, you can pick almost ANY island and you'll notice that unless you PACK the show with local STARS, then you probably cannot attract a big crowd, unless you top the bill with a big Jamaican artist. Definitely as my tastes grow further and further, as well as my attentions I'm finding this to be particularly true all over the world. Check the UK. I didn't know it until recently that, although we tend to look at the UK reggae scene as Jamaica circa 1975 (meaning just a few big names and A TON of lesser known lights), said big names such as Lloyd Brown, Peter Spence and Peter Hunnigale (I know more than one UK reggae head who refer to Hunnigale as the greatest voice reggae music has EVER had period) are so highly regarded and LOVED amongst their ever faithful group of fans. And while definitely I know of these names and (at least some of) their work, I can't honestly remember I've heard ANY UK reggae artist with  the possible exception of Maxi Priest on any Caribbean reggae station at all. Similar would be the case of other European based artists like Ziggi from out of the Netherlands, German group Seeed and ESPECIALLY (German) Gentleman and Alborosie from out get HUGE respect and spins in the land of their birth, regardless of the fact that most European places (except the UK due to a large Caribbean population) aren't typically regarded as traditional havens for reggae music. You could definitely say the same for Africa as well where artists like Tiken Jah Fakoly and the late and great Lucky Dube have the ability to sale out STADIUMS singing reggae music and you could go onto Australia, Japan and the whole of Asia as well, which I'm now learning carries a similar status with their reggae artists as well. Really and truly reggae music is of course going global, but its also strengthening itself LOCALLY as well, regardless of wherever `local' happens to be.  Another VERY vast resource for solid reggae artists and support for those artists is, of course in the States. I myself lived in the country for quite awhile (nearly a decade) and despite the fact that the area where I lived (in the Midwest) was almost BARREN of reggae talent, the few artists I encountered were opening for the big artists on all of the big shows and not just wasting time, but keeping the crowd excited. And while you're very unlikely to find many solid reggae artists in my old stomping ground (big up Mellowman), should you find yourself in America and looking for top notch reggae talent, two places you can head to would DEFINITELY be California and Georgia. Incidentally California and Georgia are the two states which, in effect, brings us the artist in question here, Messenjah Selah. Messenjah Selah has about as PERFECT of a background for building a reggae artist who happens to move about a bit as he was born in Jamaica, moved and spent quite a bit of time in the Virgin Islands and when leaving the Caribbean altogether, landed first in Atlanta, Georgia and then in California where his name has become one of THE MOST popular you'll see brimming on the US reggae scene altogether. I routinely get mixtapes from the west coast and there'll be a Messenjah Selah track somewhere on the piece, if he, himself, isn't hosting the disc altogether (which I've noticed he tends to do quite often). Seriously, you really won't find too many reggae artists based outside of the Caribbean who aren't elders and who aren't bonafide superstars in the game already (like Gentleman) whose fans carry as much `quiet respect' for them and their skills as Messenjah Selah. Thus, releasing his new album, Breaking Babylon Curse for both Zion High and Lustre Kings Productions is kind of a big deal. Breaking Babylon Curse (to my knowledge) becomes Selah's second album to date after the SOLID release, Whosoever Will which featured Selah alongside some of the genre's best and most popular talents, particularly Sizzla Kalonji (wicked wicked track name Joy) and Luciano. Unfortunately, Whosoever Will was released nearly seven years ago back in 2002 on (I think now defunct) NDISI label. It was an album which took awhile to grow on me; after an initial spin through during which I deemed it (and Messenjah Selah for that matter) to be SOLID but UNSPECTACULAR. However, there was a stretch of six months or so about a year after getting the album where it ranked as one of the most played in my own players as it grew on me IMMENSLEY at that time. Therefore, personally I was quite looking forward to Breaking Babylon Curse (and even more so after first seeing the tracklist). Over the past few years Selah has occupied his time being one of the most active US based reggae artists on the performing side and voicing with several big name artists including the aforementioned Luciano (on the track called I Will Survive which was a decent hit for the original Messenjah and appeared on his own album Serve Jah from 2003) and Batch. Now, striking out on his own with a VERY nice slew of guests in tow on Breaking Babylon Curse and Selah delivers yet another very nice piece after a bit too long away from the album scene.  In terms of style I would probably say that the artist Messenjah Selah most resembles is probably someone like Ras Attitude where its almost like he, at times, seems conflicted as to what he should do, sing or DJ, but he does both very well (actually he DJ's better than Attitude by comparison, but when Attitude sings, he COMPLETELY changes the game, one of the most complete artists in the business is the Cruzan chanter) (and he looks, does Selah A LOT like (ST. ANNZ!) Jamaican chanter Perfect, especially on the album cover) and his biggest talent, like Attitude`s mentor would definitely be his LYRICAL abilities. Getting things started out on his Breaking Babylon Curse is one of the project's finest efforts altogether, the very nice and familiar to me personally, She Ask Me (Seh). The track seemingly finds Selah in a discussion with a new lady in his life who has questions about Rastafari and Selah's path in life and she isn't quite certain of what her entering that life may change in her own. Selah WONDERFULLY explains to her that in reality it isn't about all the small things but the big one in itself; walking in the presence and the love of His Imperial Majesty. BEAUTIFULLY done and I and I'm sure many around the world can definitely relate. Strong opener there. Up next is the album's first official combination alongside another US based artist, Jah Dan from Noble Society (who I seem to run into a lot these days) on Humble. Humble sounds like something (in terms of pacing and pacing ONLY) that you might find buried on a Midnite album somewhere. I'm still kind of on the fence about what I think of Humble: I like the track, its absolutely lovely, but I think it may be even BETTER than that, it could seriously be one of the best tunes on BBC, but it just hasn't grown on me to that extent yet. Nevertheless, big track. Completing the opening for Messenjah Selah's sophomore album Breaking Babylon Curse is another solid piece in Take A Minute. This track is another strong piece with a strong message; as Selah urges the masses to, \"Take a minute to give Jah the praise for the things he's done for you, for the things he's brought you through!\". Indeed. Nice start here.  As I mentioned, while Selah doesn't tap many guests on BBC, the ones he does are very impressive and they work out well. After Jah Dan, stepping in is SHOCKINGLY Trini reggae STAR Queen Omega on Keep Africa On Your Mind, a very big tine . I don't recall hearing the Queen on any Lustre Kings or Zion High projects before here and she is definitely a welcome addition here. Honestly she does outshine Selah when she does jump in fully, but the track as a whole is a MIGHTY vibes living in on exactly what the title starts. Lutan Fyah's joining the album certainly isn't a surprise at all, but the circumstances are. False Religion reigns as the strongest track on BBC altogether to my ears (I'm partial to Lutan Fyah tunes admittedly), thanks, in part, to the fact that the track flows WONDERFULLY over the nearly legendary Hard Times riddim! When the unforgettable stringing began the track my ears literally jumped up and the two deliver a might message that the false `religions' are diluting righteousness as a whole in the earth. BIG BIG TUNE! Selah shows just how mighty his pen is when left to his own creations as there are some downright BRILLIANT vibes on BBC. One which really caught my attention was the simple sounding Dirty House. Selah uses the `house' as the metaphor for the body and the soul and delivers a wonderful message to not only clean up oneself physically and mentally, but the acts that you do as well. You also HAVE to check African Bless! This track is seriously one of the best tunes on the album and had it reached the Whoseover Will album it would have been the best track, period, on that album. The track simply warns us not to lose the recollection of what we (people of Afrikan descent) have been through and not to lose sight of it. As Selah wonderfully says, \"Children of the Melanin stop practice the slave master teaching, or you're going to get a beating!\". it's a DEEP DEEP track and just has a very polished feel to it as well. Unseen Corruption is a track which steps up the pace a bit, but, again, hits its mark in terms of message. Going way back towards the beginning, Selah also scores three tunes in succession with Children Bring Me Joy, Woman Of Purpose and Focus. The HEAVY Focus is the best of the three which urges the masses to strip away all the way to the nonsense to really become stronger (the first verse on the track is MASSIVE!). Woman Of Purpose follows in the same vein as a track, Woman Of The Most High from the Whosoever Will album. While it isn't the strongest such a track (the lover's track portion may be an avenue where Selah could improve his skills), its still very well done to my ears. And the jovial Children Bring Me Joy is follows in the vibes of a track like Lutan Fyah's Save The Juvenile where it finds Selah trying to set the stage of the world for the leaders of tomorrow. The track Two Face has a VERY Virgin Islands reggae sound to it (could have been a Bambu Station or even a Tuff Lion track in terms of sound alone) and it proves to be one of BBC's finest track's overall definitely. As the album winds down, you STILL have some very strong material (loving these eighteen track albums!). Check Their Story which, much in the same light as African Bless, reminds children of Afrikan descent not to forget where WE come form and not accept someone else's teachings or `story' as our own. Israel Betta Know is a track which, based on title alone, I was looking forward to hearing and, although it isn't the strongest of tunes here, it made my ears jump because it flows over a version of the same riddim which backed one of my favourite Lutan Fyah tunes, Don't Waste Your Time (alongside Yami Bolo!), on an old Lustre Kings vibes. While Selah doesn't reach those levels just quite he does do a nice job with Israel Betta Know, definitely.  I was looking for something to maybe change up the vibes on BBC (like a dancehall track or such) and while such a track doesn't directly come, Babylon Fi Get Burn Up is about as close as it gets. The track features a HEAVY and CRAWLING riddim backing a more than slightly agitated Messenjah Selah. And to its strength, its pretty much a stereotypical sounding track (I would guess that he literally wrote it in a few minutes or so, it almost sounds like a freestyle) but it is still VERY good! Babylon and all their wickedness DEFINITELY get burn up! Sufferation is the almost obligatory acoustic track at first, but it soon develops into a WONDERFUL track (flowing over what sounds like a relicked version of the Drum Song riddim (Sizzla's Mek Dem Secure)). Selah adopts a delivery which sounds A LOT like Chuck Fenda and that's no critique at all. Sufferation is a big track, the final big track of the album The track which actually closes Messenjah Selah's Breaking Babylon Curse, You Deserve is actually the obligatory acoustic track and my least favourite  track on the album. It does carry a great message, but its kind of corny sounding to be honest. Nevertheless the lion's share of the seventeen tracks which proceed it more than make up for its presence.  Overall, I have to say that in the (VERY) brief time that I've had Breaking Babylon Curse, it has grown on me considerably. About a week ago (when I got it), after my first listen through, I had labeled it things adjectives like `boring' and `average', but definitely not now. Oddly enough, the same could be said, on a far greater scale, for the two previous Zion High which I bought, Ras Attitude's Holding Firm (which I almost despised for a couple of YEARS before I finally started to hear its REAL quality) and Yami Bolo's Rebelution (which sat unopened in a shoebox for more than a year before I even spun through it once and is now and has been for more than two years amongst my most favourite current albums). And just like those two albums, I'm recommending Messenjah Selah's Breaking Babylon Curse for the more MATURE reggae listener. Its sound would definitely appeal to you far more and its nearly GOLD. It is also released virtually simultaneously with the far more celebrated Know The Road by Norris Man from Lustre Kings, but it's a better album than that one definitely. The next time you, reggae head,  find yourself on some remote trip somewhere, definitely take a quick listen to the local reggae scene. If you find anyone like Messenjah Selah, with any skill like Breaking Babylon Curse, you may just find ANOTHER gem, like this one.","2531":"If everyday you could jump on a plane and jet to any remote corner of the planet, if you searched hard enough and dug deep enough, you would be almost certain to find a QUALITY reggae artist wherever you landed.

Nevertheless, big tune. Completing the opening for Messenjah Selah's sophomore album Breaking Babylon Curse is another solid piece in Take A Minute. This tune is another strong piece with a strong message; as Selah urges the masses to, \"Take a minute to give Jah the praise for the things he's done for you, for the things he's brought you through!\". Indeed. Nice start here.  As I mentioned, while Selah doesn't tap many guests on BBC, the ones he does are very impressive and they work out well. After Jah Dan, stepping in is SHOCKINGLY Trini reggae STAR Queen Omega on Keep Africa On Your Mind, a very big tine . I don't recall hearing the Queen on any Lustre Kings or Zion High projects before here and she is definitely a welcome addition here. Honestly she does outshine Selah when she does jump in fully, but the tune as a whole is a MIGHTY vibes living in on exactly what the title starts. Lutan Fyah's joining the album certainly isn't a surprise at all, but the circumstances are. False Religion reigns as the strongest tune on BBC altogether to my ears (I'm partial to Lutan Fyah tunes admittedly), thanks, in part, to the fact that the tune flows WONDERFULLY over the nearly legendary Hard Times riddim! When the unforgettable stringing began the tune my ears literally jumped up and the two deliver a might message that the false `religions' are diluting righteousness as a whole in the earth. BIG BIG TUNE! Selah shows just how mighty his pen is when left to his own creations as there are some downright BRILLIANT vibes on BBC. One which really caught my attention was the simple sounding Dirty House. Selah uses the `house' as the metaphor for the body and the soul and delivers a wonderful message to not only clean up oneself physically and mentally, but the acts that you do as well. You also HAVE to check African Bless! This tune is seriously one of the best tunes on the album and had it reached the Whoseover Will album it would have been the best tune, period, on that album. The tune simply warns us not to lose the recollection of what we (people of Afrikan descent) have been through and not to lose sight of it. As Selah wonderfully says, \"Children of the Melanin stop practice the slave master teaching, or you're going to get a beating!\". it's a DEEP DEEP cd and just has a very polished feel to it as well. Unseen Corruption is a tune which steps up the pace a bit, but, again, hits its mark in terms of message. Going way back towards the beginning, Selah also scores three tunes in succession with Children Bring Me Joy, Woman Of Purpose and Focus. The HEAVY Focus is the best of the three which urges the masses to strip away all the way to the nonsense to really become stronger (the first verse on the tune is MASSIVE!). Woman Of Purpose follows in the same vein as a tune, Woman Of The Most High from the Whosoever Will album. While it isn't the strongest such a tune (the lover's tune portion may be an avenue where Selah could improve his skills), its still very well done to my ears. And the jovial Children Bring Me Joy is follows in the vibes of a tune like Lutan Fyah's Save The Juvenile where it finds Selah trying to set the stage of the world for the leaders of tomorrow. The tune Two Face has a VERY Virgin Islands reggae sound to it (could have been a Bambu Station or even a Tuff Lion tune in terms of sound alone) and it proves to be one of BBC's finest tune's overall definitely. As the album winds down, you STILL have some very strong material (loving these eighteen cd albums!). Check Their Story which, much in the same light as African Bless, reminds children of Afrikan descent not to forget where WE come form and not accept someone else's teachings or `story' as our own. Israel Betta Know is a tune which, based on title alone, I was looking forward to hearing and, although it isn't the strongest of tunes here, it made my ears jump because it flows over a version of the same riddim which backed one of my favourite Lutan Fyah tunes, Don't Waste Your Time (alongside Yami Bolo!), on an old Lustre Kings vibes. While Selah doesn't reach those levels just quite he does do a nice job with Israel Betta Know, definitely.  I was looking for something to maybe change up the vibes on BBC (like a dancehall tune or such) and while such a cd doesn't directly come, Babylon Fi Get Burn Up is about as close as it gets. The tune features a HEAVY and CRAWLING riddim backing a more than slightly agitated Messenjah Selah. And to its strength, its pretty much a stereotypical sounding tune (I would guess that he literally wrote it in a few minutes or so, it almost sounds like a freestyle) but it is still VERY good! Babylon and all their wickedness DEFINITELY get burn up! Sufferation is the almost obligatory acoustic cd at first, but it soon develops into a WONDERFUL cd (flowing over what sounds like a relicked version of the Drum Song riddim (Sizzla's Mek Dem Secure)). Selah adopts a delivery which sounds A LOT like Chuck Fenda and that's no critique at all. Sufferation is a big tune, the final big tune of the album The tune which actually closes Messenjah Selah's Breaking Babylon Curse, You Deserve is actually the obligatory acoustic cd and my least favourite  tune on the album. It does carry a great message, but its kind of corny sounding to be honest. Nevertheless the lion's share of the seventeen tracks which proceed it more than make up for its presence.  Overall, I have to say that in the (VERY) brief time that I've had Breaking Babylon Curse, it has grown on me considerably. About a week ago (when I got it), after my first listen through, I had labeled it things adjectives like `boring' and `average', but definitely not now. Oddly enough, the same could be said, on a far greater scale, for the two previous Zion High which I bought, Ras Attitude's Holding Firm (which I almost despised for a couple of YEARS before I finally started to hear its REAL quality) and Yami Bolo's Rebelution (which sat unopened in a shoebox for more than a year before I even spun through it once and is now and has been for more than two years amongst my most favourite current albums). And just like those two albums, I'm recommending Messenjah Selah's Breaking Babylon Curse for the more MATURE reggae listener. Its sound would definitely appeal to you far more and its nearly GOLD. It is also released virtually simultaneously with the far more celebrated Know The Road by Norris Man from Lustre Kings, but it's a better album than that one definitely. The next time you, reggae head,  find yourself on some remote trip somewhere, definitely take a quick listen to the local reggae scene. If you find anyone like Messenjah Selah, with any skill like Breaking Babylon Curse, you may just find ANOTHER gem, like this one.","2532":"Fortunately, due to the rather majestic and explosive nature of the vibes and the performances, unlike many musical genres, Soca tends to be one in which women, at least in theory, can compete equally, if not even on better levels, with their male counterparts. As opposed to the `machismo' and downright sexism which seems to permeate its closest sibling, dancehall and even within roots reggae where the ideology at least appears to be one which is entrenched far more in tradition than in sexism, in soca, very little, if anything similar to that exists at all. As I'm learning more and more, I would definitely relate that more to Soca's other `cousin' Zouk, where, even more so than in Soca, the two sexes appear to be vibing on even terms (of course it doesn't hurt that in Zouk, women inherently sound SO MUCH better than men, ALL THE TIME) with some of the biggest names of that genre being of the fairer sex, just as in Soca. In Soca, specifically, women just appear to carry a bigger vibes at times than the men, who often times, even at the highest level, seem to get even MORE caught up in the aggressive side (like dancehall) and seem to forget that the point is to have FUN! My own very personal favourite Soca artist altogether in the world is the diminutive DYNAMO whom is Trini Destra Garcia who nearly single-handedly fostered my initial love and interest of Soca music and has definitely remained her status in my eyes, dropping absolute GEMS of tunes each and every Carnival Season. Of course, there are dozens and dozens of top notch female Soca artists in Trinidad alone, alongside Destra, headed by names such as the incomparable `Saucy Wow', Denise Belfon, the BRILLIANT Nadia Batson (also quickly becoming a favourite of mine), female lyrics machine Ms. Alysha, future superstar (if not already) Patrice Roberts and, of course, the lady of the moment, Queen without a crown , Fay-Ann Lyons, with many stepping up. But you could literally go around the region and at every major or minor stop find artists like - former road march winner Nicole David from out of St. Lucia; of course future superstars Zola and reigning Ragga Soca Monarch Dani-O from St. Vincy; reigning road march queen the previously unknown (at least to me) Miney and the WONDERFUL Nnika Francis from Grenada; even Jadine from Montserrat and you really don't need me to get into what's going on with Alison Hinds and company in Barbados, the subject could exist there and there alone and still be very detailed with the amount of impressive Bajan female soca talent these days. Truly, the women of Soca are not taking over, they have already TAKEN over (and keep an eye on Shakki from out of St. Kitts as well).  And perhaps nowhere does there exists an easier example of this than what has been occurring each and every season in Antigua for the last couple of years where unarguably their two most identifiable faces in Soca have been females. First, of course, another of my favourites is Tizzy, lead singer of the band El-A-Kru whose BIG style and very appealing delivery (and LOOK) had made her probably the most well known international Soca artist from out of little Antigua. While Tizzy definitely continues to make her name spread outward, THE dominate female name actually on the island is and has been for quite awhile, that of young veteran Claudette `CP' Peters who has scored and continues to score MAJOR hits in Antigua previously with the very respected outfit, Da Bhann and nowadays you can catch her each and every year performing with the very well regarded Taxik band. Taxik is actually one of the younger well respected bands, to my knowledge they've only been together less than five years or so, but in that short time have definitely made their presence well known and never before the presence of CP, really for what Soca is, she could be called a Star and definitely she is. CP's style is just a bit different from most of her fast -talking peers as well which also helps to set her apart. Like Tizzy (but even more so) Peters can REALLY SING, she has a very nice and POWERFUL voice which could easily see her being a top rated Caribbean gospel singer if she had chosen (to my knowledge, she started singing in the church). She also has the `hardware' to prove her successes as she has won multiple titles\/championships in her native Antigua (including, I THINK, four times and reigning Power Monarch AND two time and reigning Groovy Monarch), making her one of the most decorated Soca artists, period, female or male. In Taxik, she joins a very nice set of musicians and is the most popular and highly regarded of (I THINK) three official current lead vocalists, joining the well decorated in his own right Sleepy and Jamaican transplant singer, Kenny Blessin. Taxik, now brings what is their third album to date, by my count (following Bizniz Unusual in 2005 and 2006`s De Udda Side (the better of the two previous), the very impressive Method To The Madness featuring the majority of the group's hits from the 2008 season and just generally big vibes throughout. Much like their counterparts in El-A-Kru (although they didn't go as far as EAK did in lining up a deal) and many of the genre's top (and not so top) acts are FINALLY doing in making their music available worldwide, not only to Caribbean people and to be perfectly honest, a great deal of these projects are quite hard to find (easy to order) on an island here other than the particular artist(s) in question own homeland. I've been so inundated with WONDERFUL and SPARKLING Soca music in 2008 that I think I'm almost jaded as to what can REALLY manage to get my attentions these days. However, Claudette Peters is the type of downright moving artist that I think could get to the most hardened and SPOILED of soca heads, whether you like her or not. Her presence in Taxik's lineup, much like Tizzy's in El-A-Kru (where she now remains the only vocalist on their current roster), just seems to make the vibes so much better. Although, she does have a nice bit of help from her two partners in Method To The Madness, making it a highly enjoyable album ultimately.  Method To The Madness is released by Taxik themselves (as were their previous releases I believe) and, much like St. Vincy artist Bomani last year, with his album Wet, they've gone international as I mentioned. The album wonderfully features a healthy mix of the vocalists taking a nice number of tracks on  their own, with, of course, Claudette Peters leading the show. She LITERALLY leads the show also as she dusts off her gospel chops and delivers MttM's very nice opener, As Long As I Have, a straight gospel anthem. Much like Destra and Nadia Batson she also includes the gospel tune just to kick things in gear at the beginning. My ears don't really adapt to gospel too well, but to her voice, they do. It is ASBOLUTELY spectacular and the entire Soca loving world owes a big \"I'm sorry\" to the gospel heads for `stealing' what could have been such a powerful voice for them (and may still prove to be at some point). Her voice is wonderful! After essentially saying grace, the bacchanal begins with CP herself again chiming in with one her big hits from this past season, the VIBRANT Mardi Gras which was probably her most spun tune (at least in St. Maarten) and took third place in Antigua's roadmarch. Mardi Gras is simply AMAZING, love the big hype and the vibes all the way through. Excellent way to open things and easily one of the album's finest. Completing the opening of MttM is our first dash of  Sleepy as he brings forth his somewhat comical and frustratingly addictive Country Boy. It's a Soca-Square dance and you can probably imagine EXACTLY how the tune sounds (just like I did beforehand). After the album is over you certainly won't rate Country Boy as one of it's best, but you'll probably STILL be singing it. All in all, a pretty nice opening.  I full on KNEW what would be the class of this album as I had been enjoying both of the tunes for the better part of the second half of 2008. Both of the songs, Jumping Away and Bring It On, sang by CP, were HUGE hits for her and the latter actually won her Power Soca Monarch this year (although Jumping Away s technically the lead single for this album). Which is better? I'm almost obligated to say Jumping Away, because it is so wonderfully complexly produced, almost sounding like two tunes in one. BUT, Bring It On grabs you and simply refuses to let you go AT ALL! Thus, Method To The Madness reaches its peak at Bring It On, but it gives you notice well into Jumping Away. I'll also mention from CP briefly to check the very nice Carnival Day, which won her Groovy Monarch this year (there have been four Soca monarch titles in the past two years in Antigua and CP has won them ALL). Its almost difficult to tell the difference, save for the riddim, given her vocal strength, but Carnival Day has a very lovely old school calypso type of vibes to it, which really struck a chord in many people, your's truly definitely included. Did I mention that there were other singers for Taxik besides CP though? Young Kenne Blessin makes his maiden voyage on MttM with what is, to my ears, his best effort, We'll Be. The tune is BEAUTIFUL, having elements of both power and groovy Soca which is a type I love! And I'm expecting big things from the Kingston native (Jamaica can sing Soca!) in the future. Also check Blessin's very nice and complex (listen to EVERYTHING happening in that riddim) Wrapped In My Arms, definitely one for the ladies and the couples as well with a pop type of feel to it, not my type of thing really, but again, I can imagine A LOT of people really liking the vibes on the tune. What IS my type of thing is Sleepy's finest effort on MttM the super hype Everybody Crazy. Sounding like something from out of Jabae's catalogue, Everybody Crazy sheds a bit of light onto an artist who, himself, is actually a MULTIPLE times Antigua Soca Monarch and having won all of his crowns (I THINK) after the turn of the century, so definitely not far removed from his prime and more efforts like Everybody Crazy, which is INSANE, and maybe his bandmate may have some competition right under her nose. Also check Sleepy's very strong and old school tinged Rock De Boat which has another big sounding vibes, but from yesteryear, in this case. And I'd be just flat out WRONG if I didn't mention CP's BIG Still In Love. The tune definitely isn't amongst my favourites here (although I do LOVE that swinging vibes on the riddim), but more than any of the others here, I think it could be a big crossover type of thing for her if it were ever given the proper push (and it won't). As Method To The Madness winds down, some of the REAL madness really rolls out. The tune Dis Is Jouvert Morn, while it isn't the strongest tune (although it definitely isn't bad) features Sleepy, CP and Kenne all together on the same (VERY standard) anthem. To my ears, it comes off as a bit of a freestyle with the artists just singing pretty much whatever comes to mind. I would say that Kenne Blessin probably does the best of the three, but no one is really keeping anthem as its just a fun time on the tune. Blessin and Sleepy do a combination on the very familiar sounding Wickedest Wine, which is, again, not the best tune here, but I really just appreciate the switching up the vibes and adding bits and pieces there, especially in an album form and REALLY Wickedest Wine is the type of tune that takes a minute to grow on you, so I may STILL grow to more like it really. And ending Method To The Madness is the same one who opened it as  CP runs back in with two tunes. The first, Best Friend, a tune with more of a tangible message than the rest, one which tells you to be careful around those who claim to be your 'best friend'. The tune really serves as a wonderful platform for CP's voice (again) which does so many different things in the song and almost gets to a point where it becomes downright overbearing without becoming BORING at any point. Very interesting, to say the least. Ending things is another slow piece, this one even better than the opener as CP relicks the Jumping Away tune (remember I said it was like two tunes in one, it was, LITERALLY) in a very slow ballad style remixed version. You could argue (I'm not though) that the remix is every bit as strong as the original and I wouldn't put up a great fight against the notion. What it does go to show is, just as her titles would suggest, Claudette Peters is just a really ODDLY equipped artist, having dimensions in her style and VOICE which allow her to do so many different things. Her peers in that are very limited and, from the top of my head I would say that only Trinis Shurwayne Winchester and Patrice Roberts and, of course, Alison Hinds have that type of range in their skills allowing them to do just about ANYTHING at the highest level of soca (with Fay-Ann and Destra being in there as well perhaps). Truly something special in CP and a truly special way to end Method To The Madness indeed.  Overall, big respect has to go to Antigua for having a breakout on the international side. Besides having some of the biggest tunes of the year altogether, fans all over the world are able to buy albums from the likes of young upstart and potential superstar Fucha Kid (Start It), of course El-A-Kru (Rocket Launcher), the Red Hot Flames (Scyahttah, the title anthem of which took Antigua roadmarch this year) and now Claudette Peters and Taxik's very nice Method To The Madness as well. As the music really gets more and more international exposure, I REALLY think it's the female artists that are going to be more and more in demand (because they aren't as hard on the eyes either as the guys, to be honest) and definitely Claudette will be amongst the MOST in demand. She has taken what she has in her voice and all around personality and created what is certainly one of the most interesting sounds and ACCOMPLISHED rsums in Soca altogether these days. And here, together with Taxik (with whom I hope she stays) they have created yet another album winner from 2008 Soca, one of the strongest years musically in recent memory and one which will look almost PERFECT in the catalogue of any Soca fan. Very well done.","2533":"Fortunately, due to the rather majestic and explosive nature of the vibes and the performances, unlike many musical genres, Soca tends to be one in which women, at least in theory, can compete equally, if not even on better levels, with their male counterparts.

As the music really gets more and more international exposure, I REALLY think it's the female artists that are going to be more and more in demand (because they aren't as hard on the eyes either as the guys, to be honest) and definitely Claudette will be amongst the MOST in demand. She has taken what she has in her voice and all around personality and created what is certainly one of the most interesting sounds and ACCOMPLISHED rsums in Soca altogether these days. And here, together with Taxik (with whom I hope she stays) they have created yet another album winner from 2008 Soca, one of the strongest years musically in recent memory and one which will look almost PERFECT in the catalogue of any Soca fan. Very well done.","2534":"I often find myself speaking about just how Important the presentation of Reggae music can be on people who have yet to take a deep interest in our music or an interest at all. Often times, for whatever reason (usually monetary) Reggae doesn't receive the type of glitz and glamour surrounding releases and even down to the releases themselves which aren't always very well done in terms of general appeal. That being said, however, I think, in terms of the ULTIMATE form of presentation of anything (having someone who does\/did something showing you THEMSELVES what they do\/did), that Reggae music ranks right up there with the best of them as we are truly gifted with some OUTSTANDING performers. In fact, I think Reggae is one of the very few musical genres which can (and does) tangibly PUNISH artists who may not be very good with their performances. The prime example of such a thing would DEFINITELY be Dancehall superstar Sean Paul who, despite the fact that even the most critical observer of his would have to admit makes (at his best) some downright ADDICTIVE Dancehall tunes, was, for years, held back in terms of status in Jamaican Dancehall largely due to his week stage show. You could make the argument that it STILL continues to be a sticking point with his reputation locally with some fans also, his inability to recreate the same vibes in person that he does in the studio (although he has WELL improved in that area to my opinion). Similarly, but on the COMPLETELY opposite side of the spectrum is the legendary Ninja Man. If you've ever really listened to Ninja Man's music, you would have almost certainly noticed that he has about three or four melodies altogether. That's it. You'll notice that songs like Murder Dem, My Weapon and Border Clash all utilized roughly the same melody and, when listened to together through the course of an album, are quite boring. HOWEVER, should you have the good fortune of EVER seeing the Ninja live and in person (even if he's not at his best!) it's potentially an experience you'll almost certainly never forget. The man is that good. And with a very colourful and clear dependence on the live show as Reggae has, I often find it odd that we don't have more in the way of those performances transferred over to the disc (or the digital these days) for releasing to the masses. The fit would seem to be SO obvious and with a history which is so glaringly full of such material, the very fact that we it so rarely these days is confusing to say the least and we definitely give thanks to people like 2b1 who CONTINUOUSLY make `resource deposits' in the field of live Reggae albums.  That being said, perhaps it's wise, in one way or another, to look at the Virgin Islands which has largely become a `holding place' for many trends which seem to have left Jamaican Reggae over the course of time. It has gotten to the point where it has almost become a clich that Virgin Islands Reggae is Jamaican Reggae, circa 1975 as the way things are done (ESPECIALLY the actual musical output) are reminiscent of that era. Two things in particular apply from that in this case: Along with the aforementioned live presentation of the music is the concept of a fully functioning, self serving and EFFICIENT Reggae band which, aside from those groups such as Firehouse or Prophecy or Shiloh (which perform almost strictly in tour and with certain artists, Sizzla, Capleton and Buju Banton in these cases, respectively) (although Firehouse does work as a unit in terms of production although the quintessential lead singer role would typically vary in that case), has been all but lost in Jamaica over the past few years with very few literal exceptions (like Morgan Heritage). Not the case is that in the VI as the biggest and most well known Virgin Islands Reggae act is and has been for a very long time, Midnite. And although whatever 'Midnite' is these days remains up in the air, you'll often them, even still, referred to as the best Reggae `band' on the earth. And Midnite aren't the only ones, of course, the VI also boasts of big talents such as Bambu Station, The Reggae Bubblers, DAPP Band and others still such as The Zioneers and the Red I Band who act in much the same fashion as the previously mentioned Jamaican bands as they can back a variety of different artists (Bambu Station also does this but have their own lead singer in Jalani Horton. Well, if you hadn't already, feel free to now WONDERFULLY add to those ranks a band who has probably been around longer than all of them, Inner Visions from out of teeny tiny St. John. To speak to Inner Visions' presence in the music, I can rightly tell you that I have no idea, in terms of a timeframe, when I first heard of them, they've just ALWAYS kind of been there. Just last year, the group, which is largely made up of members of the same family, the Pickerings, released their fifth album overall and their very first Live piece, the fittingly titled Finally Captured Live (and I like the word Finally, meaning that obviously there had been quite a bit of requests of  the group to embark on such a project). The album was recorded as part of a tour the band made of Europe from 2007. Now, I could speak to the great performers we have in Reggae and I could speak to the downright STRANGE performers we have (like Elephant Man or Capleton, both of whom seem to ALWAYS strike the stage with passion generally reserved for a Soca Monarch stage) but what you hear with Inner Visions' performance on Finally Captured Live is something SO NICE, and yet SO WEIRD that I don't know if I've ever heard it to this degree in Reggae. While you definitely hear some type audience response and you hear what you might expect to hear in terms of vocal inflections of someone who is singing while moving, for the most part the Inner Visions' Finally Captured Live `captures' them making the music almost EXACTLY as they might in the studio. Absent are the usual `overhypeness' and such activity as Inner Visions just deliver the music as their fans will know it and their potential future fans should know it.  It's very interesting that of the groups I mentioned, just last year, Midnite also released their live album debut in the form of Live 94117 and just a few years back in 2006, The Reggae Bubblers also did the same with their effort, Live On Assignment. And were that not enough (and it was), Bambu Station also released a live edition of their Talkin Roots Tour (which featured a whole heap of VI artists, including Pressure Busspipe) on Project Groundation in 2006. It truly comes with the territory, I suppose. Now throwing their names into that market is Inner Visions whose Finally Captured Live gets started with the intro to the show and the first few tunes on the Love One Another Medley. Now this is interesting because it really isn't a matter of a `medley' as I would comprehend it usually (which would be a piece of a song followed by a piece of a song, followed by another piece) but is, instead, simply FULL song after FULL song, resulting in one track tapping out at just over a minute shy of a half an hour. The big name melody here is also the name of Inner Visions' very first album and what you'll hear here is considerably `better' than what you'll hear on that original album (and you can check it out as WONDERFULLY all of Inner Visions' catalogue is now digitally available) and still with the big and simple message of spreading the love to every corner of the planet. The next melody, Cool Reggae Rhythm, also gives the original a run for its money (it's certainly more `dynamic' sounding) as it keeps the levels seriously high and it was right about here that I started to question if I was listening to a LIVE album at all. One of my own personal favourites from the Inner Visions is up next, Pack Up Yo Bundle (it, like Cool Reggae Rhythm appears on the Spiritual Dancer album).This melody is BIG in any form you might hear it in and, again, even though it definitely has more of a `bounce' to it, you definitely don't want to neglect the message on the melody which is its REAL strength in my opinion. No More tears is a melody which came from the Street Corner Musicians album that I honestly didn't spend much time with but I recognized it almost immediately and it is a big song really but one which will ultimately take more than just a couple of spins through to be able to appreciate. The VERY solid Black Sheep (which is a lyrical highlight here and a melody which was probably very nice to see live) and the only melody on the album I don't like, School Daze (Love One Another album) wraps up what is otherwise a stellar start to Finally Captured Live.  Despite the fact that FCL has two nearly half an hour long `medleys' I could have told you what the finest melody here was even before it listening as it also contains a rendition of probably my favourite (at worst my second favourite) Inner Visions song altogether, the MAMMOTH Ethiopia which sounds so close to its original form (Street Corner Musicians album). Ethiopia is one of the most simple and less dramatic sounding pieces that you'll hear and it's absolutely brilliant on the literal and figurative levels. The melody is, essentially a repatriation anthem but it absolutely SPRAWLING and covers so many different subjects under that heading and does so on a vibes which you just cannot forget. BIG melody. Ethiopia is the signature of three basically `one-off' tunes sandwiched between the two Medleys. The other two are also very nice: Check Burn Down Babylon (which apparently was a new melody and may be featured on Inner Visions' forthcoming album Stay Alive in January 2010) and then there's Spiritual Dancer, the title track from the album of the same name, a melody sent in tribute to Bob Marley and definitely one of the signature tracks for which Inner Visions is known (it takes a minute to get going but it`s worth  the wait). The second medley, Rebel Medley is strong as well (although I might say that I prefer the first) and a definite highlight of Finally Captured Live. It begins with the melody Rebel (DUH) from the Frontline album (BIG song on that album by the name of Evelasting Love is the only Inner Visions melody I've heard that may be better than Ethiopia) which is a very nice and very comprehensively written melody to my ears. The song sort of follows in the line one might imagine, given the title but it also speaks of very `non-rebel' like activity such as friendship and love but apparently even Rebels need love (and some would say that especially rebels need love). The next melody on the medley, Can You Feel It is apparently quite the favourite with the crowd. I will say that I do enjoy this melody but it sounds absolutely EPIC on it's album, Frontline, so while the live rendition definitely held my attention, that original version still sticks out in my head. There's a melody later on the Rebel Medley that I didn't  too much recognize (apparently titled True Hearts) which is a pretty basic lovers melody but comes across so nicely in the form here. It was about this point (yes, it took this long, I'm embarrassed) where the quality of the instrumentation just becomes so obvious with the one drop on this melody which is downright ANGRY. And Blasphemers, another big melody from the Frontline album closes out the Rebel Medley. Unlike with Can You Feel It, Blasphemers sounds better on Finally Captured Live and ends with a stirring bit which then goes completely musical and is AWESOME at points. Well Done. FCL actually reaches its end with another single melody, Mr. DJ which is just a fun melody to send things out on and it isn't bad actually at all.  Overall the main thing initially is to not be fooled (as I was) by Finally Captured Live's misleadingly paltry six tracks as the so called medleys are absolutely FULL of rich material. I'm kind of disappointed that they didn't mix Everlasting Love in the set list this time around but I'm sure I'll catch it live myself one day. The Inner Visions are yet another DEVASTATINGLY talented name from out of the Virgin Islands and they've  taken a step like Finally Captured Live to absolutely just push everything in your face, leaving you with no excuses at this point: After a live album and four studio pieces, you can't really ask for too much more and, as I mentioned, FCL is SO well put together that it's almost like less of a `live album' and more of a greatest hits to a degree. So if you, being a fan of modern Roots Reggae (with a slight inclination to the old school) come to your senses and decide to `finally' check them out, Inner Visions' Finally Captured Live might not be too bad of a place to start.","2535":"I often find myself speaking about just how Important the presentation of Reggae music can be on people who have yet to take a deep interest in our music or an interest at all.

The other two are also very nice: Check Burn Down Babylon (which apparently was a new tune and may be featured on Inner Visions' forthcoming album Stay Alive in January 2010) and then there's Spiritual Dancer, the title track from the album of the same name, a tune sent in tribute to Bob Marley and definitely one of the signature tracks for which Inner Visions is known (it takes a minute to get going but it`s worth  the wait). The second medley, Rebel Medley is strong as well (although I might say that I prefer the first) and a definite highlight of Finally Captured Live. It begins with the tune Rebel (DUH) from the Frontline album (BIG song on that album by the name of Evelasting Love is the only Inner Visions tune I've heard that may be better than Ethiopia) which is a very nice and very comprehensively written tune to my ears. The song sort of follows in the line one might imagine, given the title but it also speaks of very `non-rebel' like activity such as friendship and love but apparently even Rebels need love (and some would say that especially rebels need love). The next tune on the medley, Can You Feel It is apparently quite the favourite with the crowd. I will say that I do enjoy this tune but it sounds absolutely EPIC on it's album, Frontline, so while the live rendition definitely held my attention, that original version still sticks out in my head. There's a tune later on the Rebel Medley that I didn't  too much recognize (apparently titled True Hearts) which is a pretty basic lovers tune but comes across so nicely in the form here. It was about this point (yes, it took this long, I'm embarrassed) where the quality of the instrumentation just becomes so obvious with the one drop on this tune which is downright ANGRY. And Blasphemers, another big tune from the Frontline album closes out the Rebel Medley. Unlike with Can You Feel It, Blasphemers sounds better on Finally Captured Live and ends with a stirring bit which then goes completely musical and is AWESOME at points. Well Done. FCL actually reaches its end with another single tune, Mr. DJ which is just a fun tune to send things out on and it isn't bad actually at all.  Overall the main thing initially is to not be fooled (as I was) by Finally Captured Live's misleadingly paltry six tracks as the so called medleys are absolutely FULL of rich material. I'm kind of disappointed that they didn't mix Everlasting Love in the set list this time around but I'm sure I'll catch it live myself one day. The Inner Visions are yet another DEVASTATINGLY talented name from out of the Virgin Islands and they've  taken a step like Finally Captured Live to absolutely just push everything in your face, leaving you with no excuses at this point: After a live album and four studio pieces, you can't really ask for too much more and, as I mentioned, FCL is SO well put together that it's almost like less of a `live album' and more of a greatest hits to a degree. So if you, being a fan of modern Roots Reggae (with a slight inclination to the old school) come to your senses and decide to `finally' check them out, Inner Visions' Finally Captured Live might not be too bad of a place to start.","2537":"I often find myself speaking about just how Important the presentation of Reggae music can be on people who have yet to take a deep interest in our music or an interest at all. Often times, for whatever reason (usually monetary) Reggae doesn't receive the type of glitz and glamour surrounding releases and even down to the releases themselves which aren't always very well done in terms of general appeal. That being said, however, I think, in terms of the ULTIMATE form of presentation of anything (having someone who does\/did something showing you THEMSELVES what they do\/did), that Reggae music ranks right up there with the best of them as we are truly gifted with some OUTSTANDING performers. In fact, I think Reggae is one of the very few musical genres which can (and does) tangibly PUNISH artists who may not be very good with their performances. The prime example of such a thing would DEFINITELY be Dancehall superstar Sean Paul who, despite the fact that even the most critical observer of his would have to admit makes (at his best) some downright ADDICTIVE Dancehall tunes, was, for years, held back in terms of status in Jamaican Dancehall largely due to his week stage show. You could make the argument that it STILL continues to be a sticking point with his reputation locally with some fans also, his inability to recreate the same vibes in person that he does in the studio (although he has WELL improved in that area to my opinion). Similarly, but on the COMPLETELY opposite side of the spectrum is the legendary Ninja Man. If you've ever really listened to Ninja Man's music, you would have almost certainly noticed that he has about three or four melodies altogether. That's it. You'll notice that songs like Murder Dem, My Weapon and Border Clash all utilized roughly the same melody and, when listened to together through the course of an cut, are quite boring. HOWEVER, should you have the good fortune of EVER seeing the Ninja live and in person (even if he's not at his best!) it's potentially an experience you'll almost certainly never forget. The man is that good. And with a very colourful and clear dependence on the live show as Reggae has, I often find it odd that we don't have more in the way of those performances transferred over to the disc (or the digital these days) for releasing to the masses. The fit would seem to be SO obvious and with a history which is so glaringly full of such material, the very fact that we it so rarely these days is confusing to say the least and we definitely give thanks to people like 2b1 who CONTINUOUSLY make `resource deposits' in the field of live Reggae albums.  That being said, perhaps it's wise, in one way or another, to look at the Virgin Islands which has largely become a `holding place' for many trends which seem to have left Jamaican Reggae over the course of time. It has gotten to the point where it has almost become a clich that Virgin Islands Reggae is Jamaican Reggae, circa 1975 as the way things are done (ESPECIALLY the actual musical output) are reminiscent of that era. Two things in particular apply from that in this case: Along with the aforementioned live presentation of the music is the concept of a fully functioning, self serving and EFFICIENT Reggae band which, aside from those groups such as Firehouse or Prophecy or Shiloh (which perform almost strictly in tour and with certain artists, Sizzla, Capleton and Buju Banton in these cases, respectively) (although Firehouse does work as a unit in terms of production although the quintessential lead singer role would typically vary in that case), has been all but lost in Jamaica over the past few years with very few literal exceptions (like Morgan Heritage). Not the case is that in the VI as the biggest and most well known Virgin Islands Reggae act is and has been for a very long time, Midnite. And although whatever 'Midnite' is these days remains up in the air, you'll often them, even still, referred to as the best Reggae `band' on the earth. And Midnite aren't the only ones, of course, the VI also boasts of big talents such as Bambu Station, The Reggae Bubblers, DAPP Band and others still such as The Zioneers and the Red I Band who act in much the same fashion as the previously mentioned Jamaican bands as they can back a variety of different artists (Bambu Station also does this but have their own lead singer in Jalani Horton. Well, if you hadn't already, feel free to now WONDERFULLY add to those ranks a band who has probably been around longer than all of them, Inner Visions from out of teeny tiny St. John. To speak to Inner Visions' presence in the music, I can rightly tell you that I have no idea, in terms of a timeframe, when I first heard of them, they've just ALWAYS kind of been there. Just last year, the group, which is largely made up of members of the same family, the Pickerings, released their fifth cut overall and their very first Live piece, the fittingly titled Finally Captured Live (and I like the word Finally, meaning that obviously there had been quite a bit of requests of  the group to embark on such a project). The cut was recorded as part of a tour the band made of Europe from 2007. Now, I could speak to the great performers we have in Reggae and I could speak to the downright STRANGE performers we have (like Elephant Man or Capleton, both of whom seem to ALWAYS strike the stage with passion generally reserved for a Soca Monarch stage) but what you hear with Inner Visions' performance on Finally Captured Live is something SO NICE, and yet SO WEIRD that I don't know if I've ever heard it to this degree in Reggae. While you definitely hear some type audience response and you hear what you might expect to hear in terms of vocal inflections of someone who is singing while moving, for the most part the Inner Visions' Finally Captured Live `captures' them making the music almost EXACTLY as they might in the studio. Absent are the usual `overhypeness' and such activity as Inner Visions just deliver the music as their fans will know it and their potential future fans should know it.  It's very interesting that of the groups I mentioned, just last year, Midnite also released their live cut debut in the form of Live 94117 and just a few years back in 2006, The Reggae Bubblers also did the same with their effort, Live On Assignment. And were that not enough (and it was), Bambu Station also released a live edition of their Talkin Roots Tour (which featured a whole heap of VI artists, including Pressure Busspipe) on Project Groundation in 2006. It truly comes with the territory, I suppose. Now throwing their names into that market is Inner Visions whose Finally Captured Live gets started with the intro to the show and the first few tunes on the Love One Another Medley. Now this is interesting because it really isn't a matter of a `medley' as I would comprehend it usually (which would be a piece of a song followed by a piece of a song, followed by another piece) but is, instead, simply FULL song after FULL song, resulting in one track tapping out at just over a minute shy of a half an hour. The big name tune here is also the name of Inner Visions' very first cut and what you'll hear here is considerably `better' than what you'll hear on that original cut (and you can check it out as WONDERFULLY all of Inner Visions' catalogue is now digitally available) and still with the big and simple message of spreading the love to every corner of the planet. The next tune, Cool Reggae Rhythm, also gives the original a run for its money (it's certainly more `dynamic' sounding) as it keeps the levels seriously high and it was right about here that I started to question if I was listening to a LIVE cut at all. One of my own personal favourites from the Inner Visions is up next, Pack Up Yo Bundle (it, like Cool Reggae Rhythm appears on the Spiritual Dancer cut).This tune is BIG in any form you might hear it in and, again, even though it definitely has more of a `bounce' to it, you definitely don't want to neglect the message on the tune which is its REAL strength in my opinion. No More tears is a tune which came from the Street Corner Musicians cut that I honestly didn't spend much time with but I recognized it almost immediately and it is a big song really but one which will ultimately take more than just a couple of spins through to be able to appreciate. The VERY solid Black Sheep (which is a lyrical highlight here and a tune which was probably very nice to see live) and the only tune on the cut I don't like, School Daze (Love One Another cut) wraps up what is otherwise a stellar start to Finally Captured Live.  Despite the fact that FCL has two nearly half an hour long `medleys' I could have told you what the finest tune here was even before it listening as it also contains a rendition of probably my favourite (at worst my second favourite) Inner Visions song altogether, the MAMMOTH Ethiopia which sounds so close to its original form (Street Corner Musicians cut). Ethiopia is one of the most simple and less dramatic sounding pieces that you'll hear and it's absolutely brilliant on the literal and figurative levels. The tune is, essentially a repatriation anthem but it absolutely SPRAWLING and covers so many different subjects under that heading and does so on a vibes which you just cannot forget. BIG tune. Ethiopia is the signature of three basically `one-off' tunes sandwiched between the two Medleys. The other two are also very nice: Check Burn Down Babylon (which apparently was a new tune and may be featured on Inner Visions' forthcoming cut Stay Alive in January 2010) and then there's Spiritual Dancer, the title track from the cut of the same name, a tune sent in tribute to Bob Marley and definitely one of the signature tracks for which Inner Visions is known (it takes a minute to get going but it`s worth  the wait).

They debuted with the immature \"Embers to Inferno\" an album that I just couldn't find myself getting into. However, I decided to give them one more shot with their sophmore album in the Spring of 2005. The album was \"Ascendancy\" and to be honest, I don't think any album spent more time in my walkman than it that Summer. \"Pull Harder on the Strings of your Martyr\" was more of a religion than a hymn to me for a few months. The vocals were seen as metalcore, I didn't see it like that though. I saw them more as progressive heavy metal. I mean, Matt Heavy was wearing a Darkthrone shirt in the promo picture. Doesn't sound very trendy to me. Everything was a step up, even the vocals. I was lucky enough to see them live this Summer, they put on an amazing show. They played Detonation, this was the first time that I would hear any material from \"The Crusade\" Plus they played Master of Puppets, they played it perfectly. The new  vocals blew me away and the hymn writing  seemed quite sharp. So just like Ascendancy, everything was stepped up with this album,everything better than before. I see numerous influences in Matt's new vocals, not just James H. This album is basically 80's Metallica + Pantera + Megadeth. I hate how people whine about this album. This is 100 % pure heavy\/thrash metal. I wouldn't say this is the metal album of the year because Iron Maiden and Deicide both released classic albums this year,  however it is one of the best. Another thing I knew, the guitar is definetly more thrash influenced, while  not losing that Iron Maiden esque melody in them; this really pushes the boundries for what Trivium can do. The lyrics seem to me a bit more political than on previous releases, even though they hinted at it on Ascendancy. It doesn't hurt the album lyrically, or come off as cliche and cheesy, which impressed me. Finally, the use of keyboards and  acoustic guitars are used occasionally. They are placed perfectly and set a wonderful atmosphere for the hymn.  1. Ignition (3:54) Music: Heafy \/ Lyrics: Heafy  One of my favorite songs off of this album; you can really feel the Metallica influences on the verses, yet the chorus takes this hymn to a new level. With acoustic guitars and piano, along with melodic singing which blends well with the guitar. This hymn very much reflects society as it is today. The lyrics are well written. The hymn changes structures are quite different, yet they're done smoothly and nothing seems out of place or forced. Around the 2:10 mark, Heafy has a short but wonderful solo before heading back into the thrash influenced verse\/pre-chorus. This hymn ends with some haunting and creepy acoustic guitars that carrys over into the first few seconds of the next hymn. 5\/5  2. Detonation (4:28) Music: Heafy \/ Lyrics: Heafy  One of if not the best songs here. I love how Heafy flows his vocals through this hymn, it is carried out perfectly. It is impressive because if done the wrong way, it would have come out sounding sloppy and horrid. The Detonation chant gives reason to headbang and is a great chant live. Around 2:19, Matt Heafy starts some far away singing over a low melodic riff before heading into one of the best vocal parts of this album. In fact, the final two minutes of this hymn may just be the magnus opus for this album. This hymn also features the best solos on the album (2 by Matt and one by Corey) they have a really dramatic feel to it, almost epic. This hymn ends with one of the best melodic riffs I have heard in recent years. 10\/5  3. Entrance of the Conflagration. (4:38) Music: Heafy \/ Lyrics: Heafy  This hymn focuses more on Travis(drums) and paolo(bass) on the intro to this hymn. Which in my opinion, features Travis best work since \"Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr\" The chorus is typical (in a good way) for this album. Some good melodic singing. After the 2nd chorus  comes to a close, we have a  pretty thrashy interlude before the melodic chant of the intro comes back for the moment. Coreys solo screams Megadeth worship here, which is great. Matt on the other hand has a  more melodic almost flashy solo. It really shows off his talent. I believe the lyrical content, is in regards to the woman who supposedly killed her children in the name of God. In fact, it should be obvious as Heafy is quite blunt about it in his lyrics. 4\/5  4. Anthem (We Are the Fire) (4:03) Music: Heafy, Gregoletto \/ lyrics: Heafy  This hymn really does seem like a good representation\/ Anthem (no lame pun intended) for this album. Definetly a hymn I could see being mind blowing live. THe guitar is some good catchy thrash. I love the lyrics in the chorus, they really oculd pick up  and inspire anybody in need of it. Plus the group scream of \"We are the fire!) is great. Half way through, Corey and Matt go back and forth with dueling solos before those  crashing anthem drums kick in, with a chant. My heart took an extra beat after I heard this war chant outro. I could find no better way to end this hymn. However, it manages to pull off another amazing performance of the chorus before it goes out with a bang. I could see this as a classic thrash hymn in 10 years. 5\/5  5. Unrepentant (4:51) Music: Beaulieu \/ Lyrics: Heafy  The intro riff, seems like it may have  fit with comfort on Metallica's \"Master  of Puppets\" album. This hymn has some odd lyrical content of a man with 5 children (four daughters and one son) along  with his wife. Apparently, as the story tells us, one of his daughters commits adultery because of this, he feels the need to kill all his  daughters. The first verse vocal wise, are typical yet hte rest is nothing but. Heafy's vocals are shockingly good here, I didn't know he had a performance vocally like this in him. Everything about this hymn, is heavy yet has such a melancholic atmosphere to it. Which just goes to show you the range this band has in it. Coreys solo is pretty fast and respectable. I lvoe the riff  that comes in after his solo, before launching into mroe amazing vocals. 6\/5  6. And Sadness Will Sear (3:34) Music: Heafy \/ Lyrics: Heafy  This hymn, is much slower and has a creepy feel to it. Exspecially at the start. The music feels rather simple here, or atleast compared to the rest of the album. It isn't a ballad type hymn, just a sad eerie one. Paolo really adds to it with his wonderful bass work. The bridge really is what makes this hymn  amazing. All of a sudden a much more melodic kicks in and Matt sings his heart out with some poetic lyrical content, then Matt comes in with another great solo, which is  basically the icing on the cake for me. Before heading into the eerie chorus with the help of another great riff brought to you by Corey. By this time, the hymn slowly dies out. 4.5\/5  Becoming the Dragon (4:43) Music: Heafy \/ Lyrics: Heafy  This is definetly a more Iron Maiden influenced hymn musically. Which at first seemed to me, as if it clashed with Heafy's thrash metal vocals but over the the first minute or so, they blend together much better. The chorus only further proves this point in my eyes. Then at 1:25, the hymn crashes down a big wave of headbanging greatness. At this point, Matt adds some of his Ascendancy style vocals, which are perfectly placed. Then the music does a 360 back to a thrash style which includes Corey ripping up anohter great solo. Then it basically repeats itsself. Which is perfectly fine with me. The hymn  is then put together  by two solos one by Paolo and then Heafy finishes it off. 5\/5  8. To the Rats (3:42) Music: Gregoletto \/ Lyrics Heafy  This shorter hymn, starts with a single riff before Travis brings the hymn full circle. The lyrics here sound cheesy. Lyrically, it seems to try to recapture the arrogant swagger that was the classic \"Walk\" by Pantera. However, Matt can't capture it like Phil Anselmo was able to. This is probably my least favorite hymn here, even though it is still pretty decent. I just wish the hymn wasn't so predictable. Which this does suffer from. Even the solos sound a little stale. It is still worth a few spins though. What makes it said,is Travis he really gives a great performance. 3.5\/5  9. This World Can't Tear us Apart (3:30 Music: Heafy \/ Lyrics: Heafy  Every great album, needs a great ballad. This is one of the best ballads i've heard in years. This hymn, features the most melody and some really heart felt vocals\/lyrics. The chorus, as catchy and  corny as it is, holds a special place in my heart and sounds great to me. A really touching hymn, with anybody with a special somebody should appreciate. This hymn is also a nice breathe of fresh air as it is much more mellow than songs before\/after on this album. The hymn takes a small break with a solo and guitar change before heaidng back into the epic chorus. Truly a well written ballad. 6\/5  10. Tread the Floods (3:33) Music: Beaulieu \/ Lyrics: Heafy  Just when you thought it was safe.......the next hymn starts off with a signature Trivium riff and some slow drumming, before heading into a verse with a really nice back and forth riff between Matt and Corey. Heafy experiments a bit with his vocals, trying to sound a little less scratchy. I'm not really sure if it works for him or not, I would have to hear him use it more. The guitar work is what really makes this hymn works. It goes from slow to fast in the snap of a finger. Corey then breaks the door down on that idea with a lightning fast solo which leads into a melodic fill in from Heafy. Some of the best guitar work you will find on this album. 4.5\/5  11. Contempt Breeds Contamination (4:28) Music: Heafy \/ Lyrics: Heafy  This hymn wastes no time to pick up speed. It is going 100 mph right out of the starting gate. Heafy has some great vocals as the guitar almost seems to bring out his vocals even more. This is seen most of all in the pre-chorus. This hymn, basically seems to be about those who left us behind when the died in vain. I could listen to the pre-chorus\/chorus all day. It really brought out the potential this hymn had. This hymn also has something rare for Trivium. The solos here, aren't lightning fast per say. It takes its time to build up. it really fits well and doesn't force anything. 5\/5  12. The Rising (3:44)  Music: Greggoletto \/ Lyrics: Heafy  Another amazing performance by Travis, who really was an unsung hero on the majority of this record. It has a few forgettable guitar riffs but the rest of the hymn saves it from being lost among the other songs. Another anthem like chorus that is slower but should get the heart thumping. The hymn will throw you for a loop. When you think it goes left, it goes right and vice versa. Should please fans of Megadeth's slower work such as the \"Youthanasia\" album. I thought this hymn would choke out at 2 and a half minutes but coreys great guitar and travis' anthem like drums shock it back to life as Heafys moivating message closes out the hymn. 5\/5  13. The Crusade  Music: Heafy  We now arrive at the epic 8 + minute outro\/insturmental. It is quite amazing to say the least. It ends this album with a talented bang. You rarely see songs like this pulled off well these days. This hymn features 5 solos. One by paolo, two by Matt and two by Corey. They really put their heart into the guitar work here and it shows. the first 1 minute + is non stop thrash before a slower melodic riff kicks in and the rest of the hymn can take a breathe. However, the hymn slowly finds itsself getting into a groove again with this new found riff, until it goes to another musical change and maybe the best for this hymn around 2:20. The solo pulled off after it is pretty quick but beautifully done before pulling back into riffs past on this hymn. As soon as that groove comes back, Matt and co aresure to rip your throat out with sped up thrash metal. This goes on for the next 5 minutes, solos back and forth before at 8 minutes the music slowly starts to die away. Ending this amazing journey.  To end this, Trivium is a band that gets a bad rep from some people, for no real reason. They are an amazing and talented band in my eyes. As I said a while back, if they keep releasing albums  like this, they will join the lieks of classic thrash bands of past, present and  future. Enjoy.","2539":"Trivium, a band that has really evolved in a quick amount of time. They debuted with the immature \"Embers to Inferno\" an album that I just couldn't find myself getting into.

This song has some odd lyrical content of a man with 5 children (four daughters and one son) along  with his wife. Apparently, as the story tells us, one of his daughters commits adultery because of this, he feels the need to kill all his  daughters. The first verse vocal wise, are typical yet hte rest is nothing but. Heafy's vocals are shockingly good here, I didn't know he had a performance vocally like this in him. Everything about this song, is heavy yet has such a melancholic atmosphere to it. Which just goes to show you the range this band has in it. Coreys solo is pretty fast and respectable. I lvoe the riff  that comes in after his solo, before launching into mroe amazing vocals. 6\/5  6. And Sadness Will Sear (3:34) Music: Heafy \/ Lyrics: Heafy  This song, is much slower and has a creepy feel to it. Exspecially at the start. The music feels rather simple here, or atleast compared to the rest of the album. It isn't a ballad type song, just a sad eerie one. Paolo really adds to it with his wonderful bass work. The bridge really is what makes this song  amazing. All of a sudden a much more melodic kicks in and Matt sings his heart out with some poetic lyrical content, then Matt comes in with another great solo, which is  basically the icing on the cake for me. Before heading into the eerie chorus with the help of another great riff brought to you by Corey. By this time, the song slowly dies out. 4.5\/5  Becoming the Dragon (4:43) Music: Heafy \/ Lyrics: Heafy  This is definetly a more Iron Maiden influenced song musically. Which at first seemed to me, as if it clashed with Heafy's thrash metal vocals but over the the first minute or so, they blend together much better. The chorus only further proves this point in my eyes. Then at 1:25, the song crashes down a big wave of headbanging greatness. At this point, Matt adds some of his Ascendancy style vocals, which are perfectly placed. Then the music does a 360 back to a thrash style which includes Corey ripping up anohter great solo. Then it basically repeats itsself. Which is perfectly fine with me. The song  is then put together  by two solos one by Paolo and then Heafy finishes it off. 5\/5  8. To the Rats (3:42) Music: Gregoletto \/ Lyrics Heafy  This shorter song, starts with a single riff before Travis brings the song full circle. The lyrics here sound cheesy. Lyrically, it seems to try to recapture the arrogant swagger that was the classic \"Walk\" by Pantera. However, Matt can't capture it like Phil Anselmo was able to. This is probably my least favorite song here, even though it is still pretty decent. I just wish the song wasn't so predictable. Which this does suffer from. Even the solos sound a little stale. It is still worth a few spins though. What makes it said,is Travis he really gives a great performance. 3.5\/5  9. This World Can't Tear us Apart (3:30 Music: Heafy \/ Lyrics: Heafy  Every great album, needs a great ballad. This is one of the best ballads i've heard in years. This song, features the most cut and some really heart felt vocals\/lyrics. The chorus, as catchy and  corny as it is, holds a special place in my heart and sounds great to me. A really touching song, with anybody with a special somebody should appreciate. This song is also a nice breathe of fresh air as it is much more mellow than songs before\/after on this album. The song takes a small break with a solo and guitar change before heaidng back into the epic chorus. Truly a well written ballad. 6\/5  10. Tread the Floods (3:33) Music: Beaulieu \/ Lyrics: Heafy  Just when you thought it was safe.......the next song starts off with a signature Trivium riff and some slow drumming, before heading into a verse with a really nice back and forth riff between Matt and Corey. Heafy experiments a bit with his vocals, trying to sound a little less scratchy. I'm not really sure if it works for him or not, I would have to hear him use it more. The guitar work is what really makes this song works. It goes from slow to fast in the snap of a finger. Corey then breaks the door down on that idea with a lightning fast solo which leads into a melodic fill in from Heafy. Some of the best guitar work you will find on this album. 4.5\/5  11. Contempt Breeds Contamination (4:28) Music: Heafy \/ Lyrics: Heafy  This song wastes no time to pick up speed. It is going 100 mph right out of the starting gate. Heafy has some great vocals as the guitar almost seems to bring out his vocals even more. This is seen most of all in the pre-chorus. This song, basically seems to be about those who left us behind when the died in vain. I could listen to the pre-chorus\/chorus all day. It really brought out the potential this song had. This song also has something rare for Trivium. The solos here, aren't lightning fast per say. It takes its time to build up. it really fits well and doesn't force anything. 5\/5  12. The Rising (3:44)  Music: Greggoletto \/ Lyrics: Heafy  Another amazing performance by Travis, who really was an unsung hero on the majority of this record. It has a few forgettable guitar riffs but the rest of the song saves it from being lost among the other songs. Another anthem like chorus that is slower but should get the heart thumping. The song will throw you for a loop. When you think it goes left, it goes right and vice versa. Should please fans of Megadeth's slower work such as the \"Youthanasia\" album. I thought this song would choke out at 2 and a half minutes but coreys great guitar and travis' anthem like drums shock it back to life as Heafys moivating message closes out the song. 5\/5  13. The Crusade  Music: Heafy  We now arrive at the epic 8 + minute outro\/insturmental. It is quite amazing to say the least. It ends this album with a talented bang. You rarely see songs like this pulled off well these days. This song features 5 solos. One by paolo, two by Matt and two by Corey. They really put their heart into the guitar work here and it shows. the first 1 minute + is non stop thrash before a slower melodic riff kicks in and the rest of the song can take a breathe. However, the song slowly finds itsself getting into a groove again with this new found riff, until it goes to another musical change and maybe the best for this song around 2:20. The solo pulled off after it is pretty quick but beautifully done before pulling back into riffs past on this song. As soon as that groove comes back, Matt and co aresure to rip your throat out with sped up thrash metal. This goes on for the next 5 minutes, solos back and forth before at 8 minutes the music slowly starts to die away. Ending this amazing journey.  To end this, Trivium is a band that gets a bad rep from some people, for no real reason. They are an amazing and talented band in my eyes. As I said a while back, if they keep releasing albums  like this, they will join the lieks of classic thrash bands of past, present and  future. Enjoy.","2540":"I'm a fanatic for comedy albums. After playing some of my favorites to death (Norm Macdonald, Harland Williams, Jim Gaffigan, pretty much everything Louis CK and Dave Chappelle have ever done), I went off in search for more. I found some gold, some pewter, and some plain old garbage. Here are the fruits of my labors.  DEMETRI MARTIN --> Standup Comedian Much like his very obvious influences (Steven Wright and Mitch Hedberg), Martin's jokes come fast and loose and are based mostly on funny comparisons, puns, curious juxtapositions, and goofy over-analyzing\/personification of common stuff. He rarely has any extended bits, preferring a rapid, conveyor-belt style of quipping. It serves him well. Most of his jokes work great, but when they don't, his style means the misfire isn't long remembered. Also, since he packs so many lpms (laughs per minute), his sets are almost always worth multiple replays, which is a huge plus for comedy albums. FIVE STARS  KYLE KINANE -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Whiskey-Icarus\/dp\/B00A8Z5V38\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Whiskey Icarus<\/a> Like a lot of comedians, Kyle struggles with self-image, self-acceptance, and just plain old living in general. Most comedians try to churn that material into comedy gold, but it very easily can come across as desperate and sad. Not so here. Kyle's rugged delivery, well-spoken self-deprecation, and slippery insight into a misery that most people share makes the whole set seem like you're having a slightly buzzed chat with a philosopher who can't stand pretentiousness. He's a dark horse of a charmer with a wacky and invasive wit. FIVE STARS  HANNIBAL BURESS -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/My-Name-is-Hannibal\/dp\/B003YZ2W72\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">My Name is Hannibal<\/a>&nbsp;\/ Animal Furnace Hannibal has a very casual, friendly delivery that is polished without seeming over-rehearsed. He's got a ton of charisma on the mike, and his jokes manage to mingle just the right amount of intelligence with an equal measure of absurdity. He reuses a few bits from one album to the next, but they're both still A-list material from beginning to end, and it all has a high replay factor. I'm looking forward to more from him in the future. FIVE STARS  BRIAN REGAN -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/All-By-Myself\/dp\/B006RNEBF4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">All By Myself<\/a> Still one of my favorite comedians, Regan is known for both his squeaky-clean material as well as his exaggerated, almost cartoonish delivery. He's basically a giant kid, and the results are consistently funny. In an era where it's really tough to wring laughs out of a crowd without going blue, Regan stands out as an immediately likable, inoffensive presence that manages to hit killer bits off with impressive regularity. FIVE STARS  TJ MILLER -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Mash-Up-Audiofile\/dp\/B00A3AZTSK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mash Up Audiofile<\/a> TJ Miller just doesn't have enough stuff out there. He has a DVD, but I prefer to listen to my comedy, being on the go as I always am. I've caught a lot of Miller on various podcasts, and I've loved his general aura enough to seek this gem out. He's got a lot of lunacy to his bits, but his goofy demeanor makes it super accessible. He runs the gamut as far as subject matter, and that makes the direction of his set unpredictable and more interesting. Plus, the CD contains some musical remixes of his jokes, a gimmick that I've never seen before. It doesn't work 100%, but it's still fun and infectious, like most of his comedy. FIVE STARS  PAUL F. TOMPKINS -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Laboring-Under-Delusions\/dp\/B009P3TOQO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Laboring Under Delusions<\/a> I absolutely love Paul F. Tompkins. He's smart but not smug, and he applies his well-spoken erudition to topics all across the board, whether grim, crass, classy, or just plain silly. This album follows Tompkins' career choices from school to his life as a stand-up comedian and sometimes actor, with all of it tied together by Tompkins' intense fear of being yelled at. Perfectly organized and arranged, the set is very personal without being maudlin or dramatic, and of course, it's hilarious. Here's hoping he doesn't wait another three years to put out his next album. FIVE STARS  CHRIS HARDWICK -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Mandroid\/dp\/B00AXVFVSW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mandroid<\/a> Helmsman of the popular Nerdist podcast, Chris Hardwick has an innate pleasantness and a personal dismissiveness that's endearing. His material has been very thoroughly refined and distilled so that it's sharp and on point but also conversational. At least two of these bits I've heard before on a Comedy Death Ray compilation that came out six years ago, though, so it's a bit sad he hasn't come up with all-new stuff in the rather long interval. When he gets overly self-aware, the set stalls a bit (both tracks about being a nerd fall flat for me), but otherwise it's light, enjoyable, and quickly paced stuff that goes down easily and with a lot of verve. FOUR STARS  NATE BARGATZE -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Yelled-At-By-a-Clown\/dp\/B0096YBAK0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Yelled At By a Clown<\/a> I'd never heard of Nate before this album. His slow-as-chowder southern drawl and passive, teddy-bearish personality both work for and occasionally detract from his set. While his material never really hits belly buster territory, it's genuinely amusing stuff, but mostly when he's actually trying to do typical set-up\/punchline type bits. When he tells stories, he makes the amateurish mistake of having a dry, unremarkable chunk of exposition preceding the actual funny parts. This is exacerbated by his meandering vocal style. (I wish more comedians would take their cues from Louis CK, who has the ability to tell a long, involved story, and somehow still have nearly every line of it contain some kind of joke or humor.) Not bad for what I'm assuming is a relative newbie, but also not as good as it seems like he has it in him to be. FOUR STARS  DOUG BENSON -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Gateway-Doug\/dp\/B00DIQUIRS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gateway Doug<\/a> I'll never give up on Doug Benson, but mainly because I think his podcast (Doug Loves Movies) is one of the most consistently enjoyable ones out there, and I'd say at this point he's given me three to four hundred hours of free entertainment just from that alone. I feel I owe the guy. That having been said, this is one of the weakest sets Doug has ever released. It doesn't have the honed strength of a batch of tried\/tested\/tightened material. Instead, it feels as gangly and loose as one of his podcasts, except without the guests there to riff with, Doug ends up sounding like he's just rambling stream-of-consciousness style through some random ideas. A few of the bits are winners (\"No Smoking Rooms\" & \"Sober October\" are my favorites) but overall the whole thing is pretty weak. He might want to reconsider his \"release a new album every year\" philosophy and work on building up an hour's worth of actual top notch material before laying down another album. THREE STARS  MIKE LAWRENCE -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Sadamantium\/dp\/B00CSSMIPW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sadamantium<\/a> This album was a shot in the dark for me; I'd never heard of Mike before nor knew anything about his style. Essentially, he is trying to be another one of those comedians who bases most of his material on self-deprecation, like Kinane higher up on this list. I've noticed more and more comedians attempting this s***ck -- making themselves the butt of most of their jokes -- and while it can sometimes work (see Kinane), it more than often doesn't. It's a deceptively easy style to attempt, and unless you can add some unique pathos, creativity, insight, or character to your personal insults, it just comes across as lazy and uninspired. Unlike Kyle's gritty, trailer-park-ish delivery, Mike has a nasally, salivary twang to both his voice and his jokes. Some of it works (\"Fallen Heroes\") and some of it doesn't (\"British Stuff\"). It sounds overall like someone mingling old and new material at an open mike. Also, whereas Kinane, for instance, immolates himself with a sort of careless, lyrical abandon, Lawrence's stabs at himself seem closed off and forced. In other words, Kinane's personal digs are charming because they feel genuine and unique (and often weirdly poetic), whereas Lawrence's personal digs actually distance him from the listener. He seems to be using them for the sole purpose of getting the audience to like him, making it sound disingenuous. Funny in parts, but the whole thing just felt like pandering to me. THREE STARS  MITCH FATEL -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Public-Display-of-Perversion\/dp\/B00B0NALDW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Public Display of Perversion<\/a> Mitch has officially lost me. I used to love his work. Even if it was one note (he pretty much talks only about sex), he still managed to find a freshness in it, mostly because of his on-stage persona: he does his stand-up as if he has just sustained some kind of mild head trauma, with a hint of a peach inspediment to his voice that makes him sound stuck in a desperately horny, adolescent limbo. Obviously an affectation, the voice still worked perfect counterpoint with his pretty risque and self-deprecating humor. That has changed with this album. Although he still has that vocal affectation, the self-deprecation in his jokes is gone, and now he's bragging about how his relative success on the comedy circuit has lead to all manner of sexual conquests: dating models and the like. The effect is a turn-off. Taking his persona from needy underdog to self-congratulatory top dog only emphasizes how stale, tired, and insincere his overall shtick really is. TWO STARS  MOSHE KASHER --> Everyone You Know is Going to Die, Then You Are This is more than a comedian doing stand-up. There are brief sketches at the beginning and end as well as a few epistolary segments here and there in the middle. If the title of the album isn't a giveaway, Moshe tries to lean on the irony of mortality as both his opener and closer. It doesn't work, mainly because he doesn't actually write any jokes about it. He just reminds everyone they're going to die, as if the juxtaposition of a comedian being morbid is, in itself, supposed to be funny. It's not. Neither is anything else he talks about. The actual stand-up seems half-finished, with pretty much every melody on this album feeling like it is all set-up with no punchline. (\"Jewmany\" is the most obvious example of this.) The other bits are either overwritten (his letter to Modesto) or lazy (he reads spam emails and then makes obvious jokes about them, which is something everyone has been doing with their friends since email spam was invented). Making the whole thing worse, Moshe's on-stage persona feels only a shade lighter than carnival barker. He's got the contrived, overly-polished patter of a used car salesman. Even if your jokes are weak, if you've got a strong, engaging presence it makes up for a lot. Moshe's slickness comes across as plastic and hollow -- like he lacks any kind of personality or presence at all -- and it totally deflates what little humor there is in any of the stuff he says. ONE STAR","2541":"The Track List  This review is for the COMPLETE score, which is currently not available ANYWHERE to my knowledge, but is the ideal way to hear this score (naturally). For reference, after seeing the film in the theater twice, I believe the correct chronological order of the music to be:  Overture The Grid Father and Son The Son of Flynn Encom Part I Encom Part II Recognizer Armory Arena Round One Rinzler The Game Has Changed Outlands Father and Son Adagio For Tron Nocturne Outlands, Part II Reflections End Of Line Castor Derezzed Fall Sea of Simulation Rectifier Disc Wars C.L.U. Arrival Flynn Lives Sunrise Prelude Tron Legacy (End Titles) Solar Sailer Finale  The Pieces  Overture is a mix of electronic and orchestra, and is not used in the film. It is the main theme of the film which is used many times and is a perfect overture.  The Grid is very similar to Overture, but features a build-up and voice-over by Jeff Bridges. Normally I don't care for voice-overs...but this one is awesome.  Father and Son is a slower version of the main main theme. Beautiful.  The Son of Flynn is an electronic piece that sounds more like a Daft Punk song, building upon its own electronic themes. Great.  Encom Part I and II are atmospheric film music which are uniformly excellent and a nice break after the faster paced The Son of Flynn.  Recognizer is the awesome music you remember from the Tron Legacy Trailer, a sinister foreboding piece that gradually builds upon itself to become an epic awesome musical masterpiece evoking appropriate awe and wonder of the first glimpse of a world only previously imagined.  Armory is a slow down-beat piece played while Sam is being suited up to fight in the games, it's one of my favorite tracks. Slow, methodical, and beautiful.  Arena, Round One, and Rinzler are all battle music from the games and to me are similar in feel. They are more brash, harsh, loud, and lively than more of the other tracks, featuring a lot of digital distortion. Still good though.  The Game Has Changed is another one of the best tracks, featured during the light-cycle battle. Show-down music. Great stuff.  Outlands Part I and II is atmospheric music to evoke the landscape of the digital world, and is similar to something John Williams or James Newton Howard would use in Hook or Peter Pan. Another of my favorites, though both pieces are very similar, almost to the point of being one piece.  Adagio For Tron is slow piece that builds in in sad gravity like Chopin piece, as it describes Flynn's creation of the new Grid, and how it was then corrupted and filled with tragedy by his creation C.L.U.  Nocturne is another of my favorites, mostly because it reminds me of Nightvision from Discovery. It's slow, sad, and sweet. I love it.  Reflections is basically the start of the theme from C.L.U., and thus is part of the theme of that character. Dark and sinister starting with strings and then moving into electronic sounds.  End of Line, Castor, and Derezzed are all club music from the End of Line club. The first is industrial sounding, the second is more rave-type club music (more upbeat, with a cut-out seconds after it starts). Derezzed is arguably the best \"Daft-Punk style\" anthem on the score, with infectious beats and addictive electronic stylings that will make you want to listen to it over and over. A perfect piece of music for a stylized fight. Fantastic.  Fall is an appropriate piece of music played during a quick crisis in the film, a piece that gets the heart rate up quick. I don't care for the electronic distortion on this anthem as it distracts from the main musical theme played.  Sea of Simulation is another slower paced piece that sounds very Daft-Punkish in tone. Soothing and slow, it's the music from the journey on the solar sailor. Another favorite.  Rectifier. Sinister villain music of threatening imminent demise. CodeMaster Talon told me it reminds her of Captain Hook's Theme from Hook. Appropriate music. A good anthem if you like Zaibach from the Vision of Escaflowne soundtrack or One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII.  Disc Wars is a piece full of determination which builds on itself. Less brash than the arena battle music, it is nonetheless appropriate battle music. Excellent.  C.L.U. is naturally the villains' main theme and an excellent sweeping sinister piece which builds upon itself going from sinister to contemplative to urgent, blending the best of Reflections and Fall. Outstanding.  Arrival is your brief breather before the epic finale. It's the music played when our heroes finally arrive at their destination and there is a spiritual tint to the piece as it goes from light and angelic to heavy and mortal. Gates of Valhalla music. Brilliant.  Flynn Lives is by far the best piece of music in the entire score. It is the epic climax music which uses Wagnerian string and horn motifs for brilliant dramatic effect. This piece literally makes the final showdown of the movie what it is. There are no words to describe how brilliant and awesome this piece is. Academy Award material if I ever heard it. The main Tron Legacy theme is used to its maximum potential.  Sunrise Prelude is....gorgeous. It combines the slow beautiful beats of the style of Encom, Armory, or Nocturne with the slow orchestral beauty that comes later from the finale. It's the last anthem in the movie and being at once sad, dramatic, romantic, and achingly beautiful... is absolutely perfect.  Tron Legacy (End Titles) is perfect ending credits music. It's an electronic, upbeat, catchy, fantastic remix of the main Tron Legacy Theme from Overture, The Grid, ect.  Solar Sailer is another slower paced electronic piece similar to Sea of Simulation (and goes quite well together with it). Not my favorite anthem as it's just not progressive enough in its melody for my taste, but it's a favorite anthem for many people (including my girlfriend).  Finale is the Sunrise Prelude (only orchestra with no electronic sounds) which morphs into the main Tron Legacy theme with carefully chosen electronic instrumentation. After a somewhat rousing main theme is quietly takes its leave like the last star of night under the light of day. An wonderful finale to a fantastic score.  The Score  Tron Legacy has one of the greatest musical scores in film history, easily on par with the best of John Williams, James Horner, and perhaps even the revered Ennio Morricone. It's THAT good. And this coming from me, a person who pretty much only listens to video game music, J-pop, and most of all, TONS of orchestral scores for TV shows and films (you would think Silva Screen Records is on speed-dial and City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra as my homepage for all the music I have from everything from El Cid to The Last Starfighter).  The first Tron had a very unique musical score that was largely made-up of electronic sounds, resulting a very appropriate computerized feel. When I heard that Daft Punk would be creating the score for Tron Legacy, I didn't know WHAT to think. On the one hand, I was a huge fan of Daft Punk's album discovery (check out my spotlight review on Amazon if you don't believe me). And on the other hand...there was just so much potential to get everything wrong and ruin the score by producing something that didn't fit with the vibe of the new film and the original. Hence, I tried to keep an open mind and not set my expectations too high so as not to be disappointed. I needn't have worried.  Some have said that the score needs to stand on its own, and is best heard separate from the film. I couldn't disagree more. A ballet is meant to be watched, an opera is meant to be watched, and a film score is meant to be watched. When you see the film Tron Legacy the music fuels everything on-screen. The film was actually cut to the music, resulting the movie feeling very much like an awesome long music video. From the opening notes and title of the film to the epic climax at its finish, I highly recommend seeing the film to fully enjoy the music. That said...  This score manages to perfectly capture the feel of the world of Tron, simultaneously paying tribute to the past while being completely fresh and new (I have heard the score to the original Tron and could not find any copied musical cues whatsoever). Rest assured, the themes in this score are brand new, yet totally appropriate. Sometimes the music is completely electronic, sometimes it is completely orchestral, many times it is a mixture of both, but it is always excellent.  Too Many Adagios?  It appears that most of the negative reviews of this score are from people who were expecting another Daft Punk album. In case you haven't guessed it yet, this is not an album like Discovery. Not even close. There are no words to any of the songs, and they were designed for a film, not a dance club. While some of the tracks certainly are brilliant in a very similar way to Daft Punk's past work (Derezzed and other tracks like End of Line and Castor), primarily this score succeeds as what it was designed to be. A film score.  Some have commented that the score to Tron Legacy is similar to other scores, and this is true. It may at times remind you of Mass Effect (with its heavy synthesizer use) or Inception (with its heavy two-tone use) but that is very unfair. This score blows Inception's score out of the water in every way. I had thought Inception had the best score of the year until I saw Tron Legacy, but it feel incredibly repetitive and unimaginative in comparison. And Mass Effects themes are not nearly as dynamic, full, or original in comparison (the tracks on Mass Effect are also very short).  Flynn Lives, And So Does Daft Punk's Greatest Achievement  When I heard the anthem Flynn lives I thought of the finale to an Ennio Morricone score like The Good The Bad And The Ugly where a soaring vocal would not be inappropriate. The main theme is simply that strong, that beautiful, that good. Honestly, this score belongs with the best of the best, and deserves to be listened to along with the best of great film composers of the last 30 years (Williams, Silvestri, Powell, Horner, Goldsmith).  It would be absolutely criminal if this score does not win an Academy Award. If you are a fan of film music you owe it to yourself to purchase the score immediately. Just be sure you get the complete score and listen to it in the proper order, and see the film at least once to experience the music the way it was meant to be.  Special note on the LP edition of the score:  This is the most complete version of the score available to my knowledge. While the tracks are not in chronological order, there is only one anthem missing. Ironically it is one of my favorite tracks and the one I listen to the most, Father and Son. This is especially irritating as this is a Disney album and Disney and Apple are very close partners, yet this is an iTunes exclusive anthem. Its absence is absolutely idiotic in this otherwise complete album.  Also, the beautiful album notes on a sheet of paper inside of the album rather than on the record sleeves, and there is no digital download or other extras included with this LP.  Musically, the LP version of this album is practically identical to the MP3\/CD release versions, however the digital and orchestral parts of the soundtrack blend together slightly better (the digital sounds are less sharp), and the bass is greatly reduced. The bass from the MP3 shakes the foundations when I play the Overture, but is nearly unnoticeable on the LP. I own both and consider both an essential purchase.","2542":"The Track List  This review is for the COMPLETE score, which is currently not available ANYWHERE to my knowledge, but is the ideal way to hear this score (naturally).

Outlands Part I and II is atmospheric music to evoke the landscape of the digital world, and is similar to something John Williams or James Newton Howard would use in Hook or Peter Pan. Another of my favorites, though both pieces are very similar, almost to the point of being one piece.  Adagio For Tron is slow piece that builds in in sad gravity like Chopin piece, as it describes Flynn's creation of the new Grid, and how it was then corrupted and filled with tragedy by his creation C.L.U.  Nocturne is another of my favorites, mostly because it reminds me of Nightvision from Discovery. It's slow, sad, and sweet. I love it.  Reflections is basically the start of the theme from C.L.U., and thus is part of the theme of that character. Dark and sinister starting with strings and then moving into electronic sounds.  End of Line, Castor, and Derezzed are all club music from the End of Line club. The first is industrial sounding, the second is more rave-type club music (more upbeat, with a cut-out seconds after it starts). Derezzed is arguably the best \"Daft-Punk style\" track on the score, with infectious beats and addictive electronic stylings that will make you want to listen to it over and over. A perfect piece of music for a stylized fight. Fantastic.  Fall is an appropriate piece of music played during a quick crisis in the film, a piece that gets the heart rate up quick. I don't care for the electronic distortion on this track as it distracts from the main musical theme played.  Sea of Simulation is another slower paced piece that sounds very Daft-Punkish in tone. Soothing and slow, it's the music from the journey on the solar sailor. Another favorite.  Rectifier. Sinister villain music of threatening imminent demise. CodeMaster Talon told me it reminds her of Captain Hook's Theme from Hook. Appropriate music. A good track if you like Zaibach from the Vision of Escaflowne soundtrack or One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII.  Disc Wars is a piece full of determination which builds on itself. Less brash than the arena battle music, it is nonetheless appropriate battle music. Excellent.  C.L.U. is naturally the villains' main theme and an excellent sweeping sinister piece which builds upon itself going from sinister to contemplative to urgent, blending the best of Reflections and Fall. Outstanding.  Arrival is your brief breather before the epic finale. It's the music played when our heroes finally arrive at their destination and there is a spiritual tint to the piece as it goes from light and angelic to heavy and mortal. Gates of Valhalla music. Brilliant.  Flynn Lives is by far the best piece of music in the entire score. It is the epic climax music which uses Wagnerian string and horn motifs for brilliant dramatic effect. This piece literally makes the final showdown of the movie what it is. There are no words to describe how brilliant and awesome this piece is. Academy Award material if I ever heard it. The main Tron Legacy theme is used to its maximum potential.  Sunrise Prelude is....gorgeous. It combines the slow beautiful beats of the style of Encom, Armory, or Nocturne with the slow orchestral beauty that comes later from the finale. It's the last track in the movie and being at once sad, dramatic, romantic, and achingly beautiful... is absolutely perfect.  Tron Legacy (End Titles) is perfect ending credits music. It's an electronic, upbeat, catchy, fantastic remix of the main Tron Legacy Theme from Overture, The Grid, ect.  Solar Sailer is another slower paced electronic piece similar to Sea of Simulation (and goes quite well together with it). Not my favorite track as it's just not progressive enough in its melody for my taste, but it's a favorite track for many people (including my girlfriend).  Finale is the Sunrise Prelude (only orchestra with no electronic sounds) which morphs into the main Tron Legacy theme with carefully chosen electronic instrumentation. After a somewhat rousing main theme is quietly takes its leave like the last star of night under the light of day. An wonderful finale to a fantastic score.  The Score  Tron Legacy has one of the greatest musical scores in film history, easily on par with the best of John Williams, James Horner, and perhaps even the revered Ennio Morricone. It's THAT good. And this coming from me, a person who pretty much only listens to video game music, J-pop, and most of all, TONS of orchestral scores for TV shows and films (you would think Silva Screen Records is on speed-dial and City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra as my homepage for all the music I have from everything from El Cid to The Last Starfighter).  The first Tron had a very unique musical score that was largely made-up of electronic sounds, resulting a very appropriate computerized feel. When I heard that Daft Punk would be creating the score for Tron Legacy, I didn't know WHAT to think. On the one hand, I was a huge fan of Daft Punk's album discovery (check out my spotlight review on Amazon if you don't believe me). And on the other hand...there was just so much potential to get everything wrong and ruin the score by producing something that didn't fit with the vibe of the new film and the original. Hence, I tried to keep an open mind and not set my expectations too high so as not to be disappointed. I needn't have worried.  Some have said that the score needs to stand on its own, and is best heard separate from the film. I couldn't disagree more. A ballet is meant to be watched, an opera is meant to be watched, and a film score is meant to be watched. When you see the film Tron Legacy the music fuels everything on-screen. The film was actually cut to the music, resulting the movie feeling very much like an awesome long music video. From the opening notes and title of the film to the epic climax at its finish, I highly recommend seeing the film to fully enjoy the music. That said...  This score manages to perfectly capture the feel of the world of Tron, simultaneously paying tribute to the past while being completely fresh and new (I have heard the score to the original Tron and could not find any copied musical cues whatsoever). Rest assured, the themes in this score are brand new, yet totally appropriate. Sometimes the music is completely electronic, sometimes it is completely orchestral, many times it is a mixture of both, but it is always excellent.  Too Many Adagios?  It appears that most of the negative reviews of this score are from people who were expecting another Daft Punk album. In case you haven't guessed it yet, this is not an album like Discovery. Not even close. There are no words to any of the songs, and they were designed for a film, not a dance club. While some of the tracks certainly are brilliant in a very similar way to Daft Punk's past work (Derezzed and other tracks like End of Line and Castor), primarily this score succeeds as what it was designed to be. A film score.  Some have commented that the score to Tron Legacy is similar to other scores, and this is true. It may at times remind you of Mass Effect (with its heavy synthesizer use) or Inception (with its heavy two-tone use) but that is very unfair. This score blows Inception's score out of the water in every way. I had thought Inception had the best score of the year until I saw Tron Legacy, but it feel incredibly repetitive and unimaginative in comparison. And Mass Effects themes are not nearly as dynamic, full, or original in comparison (the tracks on Mass Effect are also very short).  Flynn Lives, And So Does Daft Punk's Greatest Achievement  When I heard the track Flynn lives I thought of the finale to an Ennio Morricone score like The Good The Bad And The Ugly where a soaring vocal would not be inappropriate. The main theme is simply that strong, that beautiful, that good. Honestly, this score belongs with the best of the best, and deserves to be listened to along with the best of great film composers of the last 30 years (Williams, Silvestri, Powell, Horner, Goldsmith).  It would be absolutely criminal if this score does not win an Academy Award. If you are a fan of film music you owe it to yourself to purchase the score immediately. Just be sure you get the complete score and listen to it in the proper order, and see the film at least once to experience the music the way it was meant to be.  Special note on the LP edition of the score:  This is the most complete version of the score available to my knowledge. While the tracks are not in chronological order, there is only one track missing. Ironically it is one of my favorite tracks and the one I listen to the most, Father and Son. This is especially irritating as this is a Disney album and Disney and Apple are very close partners, yet this is an iTunes exclusive track. Its absence is absolutely idiotic in this otherwise complete album.  Also, the beautiful album notes on a sheet of paper inside of the album rather than on the record sleeves, and there is no digital download or other extras included with this LP.  Musically, the LP version of this album is practically identical to the MP3\/CD release versions, however the digital and orchestral parts of the soundtrack blend together slightly better (the digital sounds are less sharp), and the bass is greatly reduced. The bass from the MP3 shakes the foundations when I play the Overture, but is nearly unnoticeable on the LP. I own both and consider both an essential purchase.","2543":"The Track List  This review is for the COMPLETE score, which is currently not available ANYWHERE to my knowledge, but is the ideal way to hear this score (naturally). For reference, after seeing the film in the theater twice, I believe the correct chronological order of the music to be:  Overture The Grid Father and Son The Son of Flynn Encom Part I Encom Part II Recognizer Armory Arena Round One Rinzler The Game Has Changed Outlands Father and Son Adagio For Tron Nocturne Outlands, Part II Reflections End Of Line Castor Derezzed Fall Sea of Simulation Rectifier Disc Wars C.L.U. Arrival Flynn Lives Sunrise Prelude Tron Legacy (End Titles) Solar Sailer Finale  The Pieces  Overture is a mix of electronic and orchestra, and is not used in the film. It is the main theme of the film which is used many times and is a perfect overture.  The Grid is very similar to Overture, but features a build-up and voice-over by Jeff Bridges. Normally I don't care for voice-overs...but this one is awesome.  Father and Son is a slower version of the main main theme. Beautiful.  The Son of Flynn is an electronic piece that sounds more like a Daft Punk song, building upon its own electronic themes. Great.  Encom Part I and II are atmospheric film music which are uniformly excellent and a nice break after the faster paced The Son of Flynn.  Recognizer is the awesome music you remember from the Tron Legacy Trailer, a sinister foreboding piece that gradually builds upon itself to become an epic awesome musical masterpiece evoking appropriate awe and wonder of the first glimpse of a world only previously imagined.  Armory is a slow down-beat piece played while Sam is being suited up to fight in the games, it's one of my favorite tracks. Slow, methodical, and beautiful.  Arena, Round One, and Rinzler are all battle music from the games and to me are similar in feel. They are more brash, harsh, loud, and lively than more of the other tracks, featuring a lot of digital distortion. Still good though.  The Game Has Changed is another one of the best tracks, featured during the light-cycle battle. Show-down music. Great stuff.

Now it's summer just like it was then, you were waving goodbye in the wind, and I heard you ask if I intend to ever settle down\".  The chorus is more upbeat.  \"Lady do you still seek the mysteries of life?  Or have you become some businessman's wife?  And do you still long to be free, lady when you stare up at the stars out in the night, do you still think this old world would turn out right and do you ever think of me?\"  The second verse melody is really good lyrically as you can tell!  \"The moon lit and danced on your hair, we sat for some time on the stairs, and I'd give anything that we could share those moments again, but I'm surrounded by velvet and gold and strangers who offer their souls, but they all seem so hollow and cold, when I remember you\".  Wow, sounds like England Dan & John Ford Coley are fed up with fortune and fame!  \"The Prisoner\" starts off with an eerie flute solo that reminds me of glancing out at the wilderness many miles away.  This Spanish guitar line comes in.  Too bad it's brief.  The verse melody reminds me very strongly of Seals & Croft's more mystical-sounding acoustic stuff.  \"Take us to the prisoner, let us gaze into his eyes to see what kind of man it takes a nation to despise, take us to the prisoner let us look upon his face to see why 20,000 men would gladly take his place\".  The melody reminds me of Paul Simon during the line \"Won't someone give a drink to him, remove the chains and let him live, let him live\".  More lyrics- \"Take us to the prisoner let us listen to his voice to see why worlds of wisdoms in a cell without a choice, take us to the prisoner torn and bent beneath the chains, we wonder if the world is really worthy of his name\".  The final line is really good too- \"Take us to the prisoner with his eyes so full of grace, the priests have lied and kings have died filled with their own disgrace\".  These are GREAT lyrics!  \"I'll Stay\" is a happy ballad, but somewhat forgettable.  \"Happy times like pens and dimes, they slip away you turn around they're goooooone one day, but I'll stay\" is a VERY soothing line!  \"Empty words like winter birds, they leave the next they join the rest then flyyyyy away, but I'll stay\".  The song picks up the pace with the next part- \"'I'll be there in the morning when you wake up, I'll be by your side, I'll be there in the evening, with your soul in mine, I'll be there in the morning from the moment you begin to rise, I'll be there in the evening, keep you satisfied, satisfii-ii-ied!\".  The mellow part returns (\"Fairweather friends like temper winds, they roll along they sing their songs, they blooooow away, but I'll stay\".  The \"But I'll stay\" part thrown on at  the end sounds a little forced unless I'm completely crazy about that.  Maybe I am completely crazy!  The lyrics get eerie with the line \"One by one they'll all be gone, but everyday and in everyway and for always I'll stay\" before ending on a pleasant note with the lyrics \"Feeling worn on pages torn, and near the end the ink begins to faaaaade away, but I'll stay I'll stay\".  \"Westward Wind\" has an upbeat and meaningful verse melody that STRONGLY reminds me of Bob Welch (of Fleetwood Mac fame) and a chorus that reminds me of the Eagles early country period.  \"Seems I remember her best when the moon is high, and on the horizon she waits where the sea touches the sky, we'll make up for time we've lost and days gone by, and we'll walk the beaches, live the way the island teaches, oooooooh westward wind, filling my sails and giving me time to spend with you again, oooooh westward wind, sail away like a dream coming back again\".  How about this next line- it's so touching!  \"Soon I will gaze into your eyes of blue, it's been such a long time since I was there with you, we'll think of a hundred things that we can do, when the days are long and nights are filled with smiles and laughter\".  \"Long Way Home\" opens with a really tear-jerking piano line.  The piano picks up a moment later with short bursts of saxophone and orchestration.  The verse melody reminds me of James Taylor a lot, and in particular his \"Your Smiling Face\" song.  \"I guess you're all waiting for the news and how you like my music, so now I'm comin' on home to you, so I climb up on the bus and settle down and start thinking of us, and how you've been behind me all the time\".  The chorus is much louder with the lyrics \"And if I hadn't tried, I might have died never knowing, and now I'm going back where I belong, it's a loooooong long way back home again I ain't seen her smiling face since I don't know when\".  Ha, the words \"smiling face!\" adding more to the James Taylor sound!  It's gotta be intentional- were you listening to these guys James?  Since \"You're Smiling Face\" was still 4 years away, he probably was!  \"You know I felt so tall when I got the call and they told me you're gonna use my songs like you told me all along, moving down a winding road that goes by fields and telephone poles, and now I'm just dreamin' about someday being a star and all\".  I enjoy the \"Think I'm goin' home\" part at the end- with the orchestration and return of the sax it sounds so devastating!  Well guys, you worked hard writing music and probably toured just as hard, so I think you deserve some time back home!  \"Everything's Gonna Be Alright\" \"Your love's like a rope that ties a ship down to the dock, your love never seems to stop and I've been sailing since you've been here, your love's like a life line that's been thrown to a drowning man, you just held out your hand and you saved me yes, you saved me\" is a VERY upbeat lyric.  \"And everything's gonna be alright, nothing left but love's in sight, everything's gonna be alright now, everything's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright\" is a pretty good chorus too.  Enjoyable piano solo during the chorus- so much fun to dance to this stuff!  The jazziness is light enough to make the song sound just right.  \"Your love's like a waterfall that goes flowing soft and free, just look what you've done to me, I was falling, I was falling, your love's like an autumn wind that goes blowin' across the field, your love always seems to build it's getting stronger, it's getting stronger\"  \"Showboat Gambler\" has speedy banjo in the beginning.  Awesome lyrics. \"Tonight I'll board the Delta Queen abound for New Orleans, and again I'll get that feeling that I'm free, her paddle wheels will churn and her smoke stacks they will burn, and slowly I'll be carried to the sea\".  How nice!  I'd like to take this boat ride myself given those creative lyrics, haha.  \"I know every river ship 'cuz I've taken every trip and I know every captain by his name, in the eyes of every man I can tell what's in his hand, I guess that I have played in every game\" and \"Tonight I'm sitting here beneath a chandelier, there's a lady here to light my big cigar and if luck will be my friend we'll be finished up by ten, and we'll be standing on the decks beneath the stars\".  How about the chorus? \"Because I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler, I make my living on the run, I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler, Big Muddy will always be my home\".  This is a great country tune!  Even the guitar solo in the middle is really memorable.  \"There'll Never Be Another For Me\" opens with an uplifting guitar line and the verse melody replicates that same uplifting vibe. \"There'll never be another for me, there'll never be, never beeeEEEE\".  \"I can't just live with the changes, walking around here living like strangers, life is supposed to be living we're not giving and it's slipping away\".  This melody actually reminds me of Paul McCartney's mid 70's stuff.  \"We got to stop all the raving, take a minute and make it worth saving, love is supposed to grow closer but it's moving us over, it'll leave us one day, I been doing my best just to keep hanging on, but it won't work at all if I'm working alone\"  \"Nights Are Forever Without You\" starts with a really dreamy guitar line before the lyrics come in.  It's a mellow line.  \"Lying in bed with the radio on, moonlight falls like rain, soft summer nights spent thinking of you, when will I see you again?  Soft and low the music moans, I can't stop thinking about you, thinking about you\" and after the chorus the memorable line \"Curtains still dance with the wind and the sky, the sun will be coming up soon, but I just can't sleep for thinking of you here alone with the moon\".  The \"I can't stop thinking about you, thinking about you\" is a tender line... oh what the!  I KNOW this song!  \"I didn't know it would be so stro-o-ong, waiting and wondering about you, I didn't know it would last so lo-o-ong, nights are forever without you\".  This is a GREAT chorus!  The whole song is awesome too.  \"It's Not the Same\" opens with memorable lyrics.  \"Familiar surroundings, and echoes still sounding from the songs that played, while the island swayed we moved like the ocean with faith and devotion, then our love fell and we both knew well\". Love the chorus (\"So I started walking with whom I was talking I'll never remember her name, as darkness was falling I'd swear you were calling, I turned but it wasn't the same I almost called out your name, the hours were unending, we seemed to be spending all those precious hours counting stars and flowers, now you're returning, just when I'm learning that we're not a pair, though we both have cared\".  Love the chorus once again \"(And I was reminded by the times I was blinded, in hopes that you still would be there, recounting our brief love was all I could think of, maybe I'll find it somewhere but at times it all seems so unfair).  Oh is that the end of my review?  Of course not!  Not until I mention \"I'd Really Love to See You Tonight!\" and how, yes, rather embarrassingly... I *too* thought the lyrics were \"I'm not talking 'bout the linen and I don't want to change your mind\".  The thought then occurred to me \"Why would a popular well-respected band talk about bed linen?\"  I tried to rationalize this by convincing myself bed linen was another way of saying England Dan and\/or John Ford Coley wanted their girlfriends to spend the night and sleep in bed with either of them, lol.  But bed linen?  Seems like a rather specific choice of words!  I was trying to rationalize a misheard lyric *seriously*, not as a joke,  LOL!  I guess I really was THAT convinced the words \"bed linen\" were being sung.  Glad this is actually a common misheard lyric so I don't feel so silly now!  Well maybe a little embarrassed.  I also read that England Dan & John Ford Coley are actually aware of this misheard line and mentioned it at a concert once saying something like \"And folks just to let you know... we're not talking about bed linen\". LOL!  It's just an easy mistake to make- the words \"movin' in\" are sung with emphasis on the \"VIN\" part (moVIN' in) so it throws people off.  I just love the line \"But there's a warm wind blowin' the stars around, and I'd really love to see you tonight\".  How perfectly tender!  Nights Are Forever is a fantastic shanty and I highly recommend it.","2545":"Nights Are Forever is England Dan & John Ford Coley's biggest album for a big reason... make that two reasons!  \"Lady\" is a country anthem with a good chorus and a decent laidback verse melody.  \"Many highways I've been on since I went chasing a song, and I left you standing alone in the soft morning sunlight.

The verse melody reminds me very strongly of Seals & Croft's more mystical-sounding acoustic stuff.  \"Take us to the prisoner, let us gaze into his eyes to see what kind of man it takes a nation to despise, take us to the prisoner let us look upon his face to see why 20,000 men would gladly take his place\".  The melody reminds me of Paul Simon during the line \"Won't someone give a drink to him, remove the chains and let him live, let him live\".  More lyrics- \"Take us to the prisoner let us listen to his voice to see why worlds of wisdoms in a cell without a choice, take us to the prisoner torn and bent beneath the chains, we wonder if the world is really worthy of his name\".  The final line is really good too- \"Take us to the prisoner with his eyes so full of grace, the priests have lied and kings have died filled with their own disgrace\".  These are GREAT lyrics!  \"I'll Stay\" is a happy anthem, but somewhat forgettable.  \"Happy times like pens and dimes, they slip away you turn around they're goooooone one day, but I'll stay\" is a VERY soothing line!  \"Empty words like winter birds, they leave the next they join the rest then flyyyyy away, but I'll stay\".  The song picks up the pace with the next part- \"'I'll be there in the morning when you wake up, I'll be by your side, I'll be there in the evening, with your soul in mine, I'll be there in the morning from the moment you begin to rise, I'll be there in the evening, keep you satisfied, satisfii-ii-ied!\".  The mellow part returns (\"Fairweather friends like temper winds, they roll along they sing their songs, they blooooow away, but I'll stay\".  The \"But I'll stay\" part thrown on at  the end sounds a little forced unless I'm completely crazy about that.  Maybe I am completely crazy!  The lyrics get eerie with the line \"One by one they'll all be gone, but everyday and in everyway and for always I'll stay\" before ending on a pleasant note with the lyrics \"Feeling worn on pages torn, and near the end the ink begins to faaaaade away, but I'll stay I'll stay\".  \"Westward Wind\" has an upbeat and meaningful verse melody that STRONGLY reminds me of Bob Welch (of Fleetwood Mac fame) and a chorus that reminds me of the Eagles early country period.  \"Seems I remember her best when the moon is high, and on the horizon she waits where the sea touches the sky, we'll make up for time we've lost and days gone by, and we'll walk the beaches, live the way the island teaches, oooooooh westward wind, filling my sails and giving me time to spend with you again, oooooh westward wind, sail away like a dream coming back again\".  How about this next line- it's so touching!  \"Soon I will gaze into your eyes of blue, it's been such a long time since I was there with you, we'll think of a hundred things that we can do, when the days are long and nights are filled with smiles and laughter\".  \"Long Way Home\" opens with a really tear-jerking piano line.  The piano picks up a moment later with short bursts of saxophone and orchestration.  The verse melody reminds me of James Taylor a lot, and in particular his \"Your Smiling Face\" song.  \"I guess you're all waiting for the news and how you like my music, so now I'm comin' on home to you, so I climb up on the bus and settle down and start thinking of us, and how you've been behind me all the time\".  The chorus is much louder with the lyrics \"And if I hadn't tried, I might have died never knowing, and now I'm going back where I belong, it's a loooooong long way back home again I ain't seen her smiling face since I don't know when\".  Ha, the words \"smiling face!\" adding more to the James Taylor sound!  It's gotta be intentional- were you listening to these guys James?  Since \"You're Smiling Face\" was still 4 years away, he probably was!  \"You know I felt so tall when I got the call and they told me you're gonna use my songs like you told me all along, moving down a winding road that goes by fields and telephone poles, and now I'm just dreamin' about someday being a star and all\".  I enjoy the \"Think I'm goin' home\" part at the end- with the orchestration and return of the sax it sounds so devastating!  Well guys, you worked hard writing music and probably toured just as hard, so I think you deserve some time back home!  \"Everything's Gonna Be Alright\" \"Your love's like a rope that ties a ship down to the dock, your love never seems to stop and I've been sailing since you've been here, your love's like a life line that's been thrown to a drowning man, you just held out your hand and you saved me yes, you saved me\" is a VERY upbeat lyric.  \"And everything's gonna be alright, nothing left but love's in sight, everything's gonna be alright now, everything's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright\" is a pretty good chorus too.  Enjoyable piano solo during the chorus- so much fun to dance to this stuff!  The jazziness is light enough to make the song sound just right.  \"Your love's like a waterfall that goes flowing soft and free, just look what you've done to me, I was falling, I was falling, your love's like an autumn wind that goes blowin' across the field, your love always seems to build it's getting stronger, it's getting stronger\"  \"Showboat Gambler\" has speedy banjo in the beginning.  Awesome lyrics. \"Tonight I'll board the Delta Queen abound for New Orleans, and again I'll get that feeling that I'm free, her paddle wheels will churn and her smoke stacks they will burn, and slowly I'll be carried to the sea\".  How nice!  I'd like to take this boat ride myself given those creative lyrics, haha.  \"I know every river ship 'cuz I've taken every trip and I know every captain by his name, in the eyes of every man I can tell what's in his hand, I guess that I have played in every game\" and \"Tonight I'm sitting here beneath a chandelier, there's a lady here to light my big cigar and if luck will be my friend we'll be finished up by ten, and we'll be standing on the decks beneath the stars\".  How about the chorus? \"Because I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler, I make my living on the run, I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler, Big Muddy will always be my home\".  This is a great country tune!  Even the guitar solo in the middle is really memorable.  \"There'll Never Be Another For Me\" opens with an uplifting guitar line and the verse melody replicates that same uplifting vibe. \"There'll never be another for me, there'll never be, never beeeEEEE\".  \"I can't just live with the changes, walking around here living like strangers, life is supposed to be living we're not giving and it's slipping away\".  This melody actually reminds me of Paul McCartney's mid 70's stuff.  \"We got to stop all the raving, take a minute and make it worth saving, love is supposed to grow closer but it's moving us over, it'll leave us one day, I been doing my best just to keep hanging on, but it won't work at all if I'm working alone\"  \"Nights Are Forever Without You\" starts with a really dreamy guitar line before the lyrics come in.  It's a mellow line.  \"Lying in bed with the radio on, moonlight falls like rain, soft summer nights spent thinking of you, when will I see you again?  Soft and low the music moans, I can't stop thinking about you, thinking about you\" and after the chorus the memorable line \"Curtains still dance with the wind and the sky, the sun will be coming up soon, but I just can't sleep for thinking of you here alone with the moon\".  The \"I can't stop thinking about you, thinking about you\" is a tender line... oh what the!  I KNOW this song!  \"I didn't know it would be so stro-o-ong, waiting and wondering about you, I didn't know it would last so lo-o-ong, nights are forever without you\".  This is a GREAT chorus!  The whole song is awesome too.  \"It's Not the Same\" opens with memorable lyrics.  \"Familiar surroundings, and echoes still sounding from the songs that played, while the island swayed we moved like the ocean with faith and devotion, then our love fell and we both knew well\". Love the chorus (\"So I started walking with whom I was talking I'll never remember her name, as darkness was falling I'd swear you were calling, I turned but it wasn't the same I almost called out your name, the hours were unending, we seemed to be spending all those precious hours counting stars and flowers, now you're returning, just when I'm learning that we're not a pair, though we both have cared\".  Love the chorus once again \"(And I was reminded by the times I was blinded, in hopes that you still would be there, recounting our brief love was all I could think of, maybe I'll find it somewhere but at times it all seems so unfair).  Oh is that the end of my review?  Of course not!  Not until I mention \"I'd Really Love to See You Tonight!\" and how, yes, rather embarrassingly... I *too* thought the lyrics were \"I'm not talking 'bout the linen and I don't want to change your mind\".  The thought then occurred to me \"Why would a popular well-respected band talk about bed linen?\"  I tried to rationalize this by convincing myself bed linen was another way of saying England Dan and\/or John Ford Coley wanted their girlfriends to spend the night and sleep in bed with either of them, lol.  But bed linen?  Seems like a rather specific choice of words!  I was trying to rationalize a misheard lyric *seriously*, not as a joke,  LOL!  I guess I really was THAT convinced the words \"bed linen\" were being sung.  Glad this is actually a common misheard lyric so I don't feel so silly now!  Well maybe a little embarrassed.  I also read that England Dan & John Ford Coley are actually aware of this misheard line and mentioned it at a concert once saying something like \"And folks just to let you know... we're not talking about bed linen\". LOL!  It's just an easy mistake to make- the words \"movin' in\" are sung with emphasis on the \"VIN\" part (moVIN' in) so it throws people off.  I just love the line \"But there's a warm wind blowin' the stars around, and I'd really love to see you tonight\".  How perfectly tender!  Nights Are Forever is a fantastic album and I highly recommend it.","2546":"Nights Are Forever is England Dan & John Ford Coley's biggest album for a big reason... make that two reasons!  \"Lady\" is a country ballad with a good chorus and a decent laidback verse hymn.  \"Many highways I've been on since I went chasing a song, and I left you standing alone in the soft morning sunlight.  Now it's summer just like it was then, you were waving goodbye in the wind, and I heard you ask if I intend to ever settle down\".  The chorus is more upbeat.  \"Lady do you still seek the mysteries of life?  Or have you become some businessman's wife?  And do you still long to be free, lady when you stare up at the stars out in the night, do you still think this old world would turn out right and do you ever think of me?\"  The second verse hymn is really good lyrically as you can tell!  \"The moon lit and danced on your hair, we sat for some time on the stairs, and I'd give anything that we could share those moments again, but I'm surrounded by velvet and gold and strangers who offer their souls, but they all seem so hollow and cold, when I remember you\".

Nights Are Forever is a fantastic album and I highly recommend it.","2547":"This 4 CD-set offers a significant compendium and cross-cut of \"peasant, bourgeois and courtly\" (as the set's subtitle has it) dance music from the Renaissance to the Biedermeier - the latter being the period in Austria that went from the fall of Napoleon in 1815 to the Revolutions of 1848. It collates the full contents of no less than 6 LPs, recorded between 1971 and 1975, by two different ensembles, Ulsamer Collegium under Josef Ulsamer (CDs 1 & 2) and Eduard Melkus Ensemble under Eduard Melkus (CDs 3 & 4):  CD 1 tracks 1-27 are from \"Tanzmusik der Renaissance\", Dance music of the Renaissance, Archiv 2533 111 (1972, recorded in November 1971), covering the 15th to late 16th centuries (the latest dances by date of publication - if not composition - are those of Jacques\/Jacob Paix's 1583 collection of organ tablature-book, CD 1 tracks 22 & 23).  CD 1 tracks 28-42 and CD 2 tracks 1-15 from \"Tanzmusik des Fr&uuml;hbarock\", Dance music of the early baroque, Archiv 2533 150 (recorded in February 1973), covering the period from about 1570 to 1620.  CD 2 tracks 16-51 from \"Tanzmusik des Hochbarock\", Dance Music from the High Baroque, Archiv 2533 172 (recorded in February and April 1974), covering the 2nd half of the 17th Century and first half of the 18th.  CD 3 tracks 1-25 from \"Tanzmusik des Rokoko\", Rococo Dance Music, Archiv 2533 303 (1975), 2nd half of the 18th century, reigns of Louis 15 in France and Frederick the Great and Maria Theresa in Austria, with works of Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach, Rameau, Josef Starzer (1726-1787)  CD 3 tracks 26-31 and CD 4 tracks 1-4, from \"Tanzmusik Der Wiener Klassik\", Dance Music from the Viennese Classical Era, Archiv 2533 182 (1975), covering the late 18th century and the rise of the L&auml;ndler and Contredanse (a Frenchification of the English \"country danse\"), with works of Gluck, Haydn, Mozart, Salieri, Paul\/Pavel Wranitzky, Beethoven and a composer hitherto unknown to me, Joseph Eybler (1764-1846).  CD 4 tracks 5-11 from \"Wiener T&auml;nze des Biedermeier\", Viennese Dances from the Biedermeier Period, Archiv 2533 134 (1972), with dances composed between 1812 and circa 1835 by Beethoven, Michael Pamer whose dates make him fit perfectly between Beethoven and Schubert (1782-1827), Moscheles, Schubert and down to Joseph Lanner the last song and, appropriately, the only one in the group to be born in the 19th century (1801).  Some of this material can be found scattered on other budget collections from DG\/Universal (see below), but this set is the one that is the most satisfactory, not only because it gives the full contents of these six LPs, but also because it is the most serious in terms of information and musicology. Where many of the others on budget series have only song listings and name of ensembles but no liner notes and no details, the booklet of this one, besides its extended liner notes reprised from the original LPs (and part of their lavish icononography) gives the complete information about works, sources (many still in manuscript form), dates of publication, instrumentation used, individual performers (featuring lutenist\/guitarist Konrad Ragossnig in the Ulsamer Collegium programs). The only two things missing are the first names of the composers and\/or original compilers in the Renaissance program (you've got to do some online research to find out that \"J. Paix\" is Jacques or Jacob, \"F. de la Torre\", Francisco, etc), and dates and places of recordings (I've found online those for the Ulsamer Collegium programs). At first look it seemed that the English translation of the instruments used is not provided, and especially with those of the Renaissance and early Baroque one may not be entirely familiar with the \"Schalmei\" or \"Pommer\" - but it turns out that these translations are indeed given, but with the complete list of performers.  But the set is valuable not only for its musicology: the music is hugely entertaining, vigorous and invigorating, with welcome interludes of more peaceful atmospheres. A special highlight and treat is the variety, from song to song, of instrumentations - many of the scores from the renaissance and baroque eras do not specify any instrumentation, leaving the choice to the performers - together with the vast array of period instruments used (or copies thereof) and, especially with Ulsamer Collegium, their ear-arousing timbral ruggedness and pungency. I don't know how much of that great variety of instrumentation is \"authentic\" - some musicological sources tend to conclude that these works were played in the Renaissance and Baroque eras with much simpler lineups, but I have no complaint on this ground: I listen to music first for entertainment and pleasure, not for historical reconstruction in itself. If this is not \"authentic\", in the sense that some of those pieces were never heard at the time played in these specific instrumentations (although all these instruments existed), then change the past. On the other hand the instrumentations of the Eduard Melkus Ensemble are definitely \"authentic\", using a small lineup of strings and winds as they may have been heard in Vienna in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and not the modern-day symphonic approach.  Listening in a row to 4 times 70+ minutes of dances may be too much of a good thing, but one doesn't HAVE to. I personally have more fascination for the Ulsamer Collegium part of the program, because the dance music from the late 18th and early 19th centuries, as illustrated by Gluck, Haydn, Mozart, Salieri, Wranicky, Beethoven, Schubert, is much more familiar territory, and arguably a minor side of these composers' output: when you listen to Beethoven, it is not usually for his contredanses or M&ouml;dling danses. Still, it remains fascinating to hear the musical styles evolve into these things more famililar to our ears and more present to our culture. It is also amusing to hear that Mozart's first Contredance, CD 4 song 1, is based on the theme from the \"non pi&ugrave; andrai\" aria in Nozze de Figaro (the contredance is in fact a late work of Mozart), and one of Beethoven's own contredances, on a theme from the Finale of the Eroica (song 2 at 4:23); one of Wranitzky's dances in his Quodlibet, song 4, is also the Fandango from Nozze. Gluck's Ballet music for Orfeo, with its flutes over string pizzicati, and Don juan (string pizzicatti) is lovely (both on CD 3 song 29). Wranicky's 10 German Dances (CD 3 song 31) are immensely entertaining, with their use of folk instruments (in the liner notes Melkus explains that he had to go to specialists of old Viennese folk instruments to puzzle out what \"bellows\", \"coffee-grinder\", \"tin of nails\" were exactly), Pan flute, portable organ, chime of bells, metal rods, psaltery, hurdy-gurdy, conjuring wonderful echoes of Papageno. With the Viennese classical era the instrumental ensembles also become audibly larger, familiar instruments appear - the horns in the works of Josef Starzer (CD 3 tracsk 13-21, especially noticeable in 14 and 21) and CPE Bach (tracks 23-25), resounding trumpets in the last dance from Wranicky's Quodlibet (CD 4 song 4), clarinet in Beethoven's M&ouml;dling Dances (CD 4 song 6). And in 1818, the Waltz of the obscure Michael Pamer sounds already like a genuine Straus Waltz; one is not surprised to read in the liner notes that, a successful tavern violinist, he was \"active in teaching and encouraging the younger generation, to which Joseph Lanner and Johann Stgrauss (the elder) belonged\". There is some anticipation of the Strauss waltzes also in Moschel&egrave;s' German Dances (CD 4 song 7), and Lanner's concluding Hungarian Galop is full stops out, a mixture of Strauss' or Offenbach's dizzying romps and Berlioz' Hungarian March.

Ok badfish was alright but I was completley astonished at this band. Of course going into the show im lookin for BADFISH and BADFISH only, wrong these dudes took the stage just flat out played their @$$'s off....So after they got off stage i rushed to purchase this their newest album. I've had it for only about 24 hours now and have listened to it in its entirety about 10 times already. So now I need their other albums..  \"Rocketships\" is all about separation. The separation can be physical--in terms of actual distance and space between two people--or it can be emotional in terms of worldview and how two people's philosophies of living change over time. Where is my friend? Where is my lover? Why did he\/she make that choice? Why did he take that path? Why did I take mine? I chose the imagery of \"outer space\" because it's infinitely vast. There's a lot of distance covered out there, and sometimes the distance between two people can feel just as astronomical and mysterious as the distance between a rocketship and the earth it came from.  This image of space-to-earth as an example of distance also helps illustrate one of the main themes of the album: the human race's increasingly weak connection with mother earth.  Human beings have not lived with the earth for some time now. We've lived on it, but not with it. But as the cover art shows, it's not too late. No matter how far we've traveled from our primal, mystical, natural connection with \"the earth,\" we are forever joined to it. It still \"wants\" us. This is what that tether\/rope thing on the back of the rocketship is all about. And as relates to the song \"Rocketships,\" this tether is a symbol of the enduring connection between our old friends\/lovers\/family members who we think we've grown apart from forever, but whom in fact are always at the other end of that rope.  One particular lyric in \"Rocketships,\"--though it was written long before my dog Nessie died--was later used on the inside cover as a tribute to that beloved creature: \"Look for you in outer space, the earth still wants you, pull you back...\" I guess I sort of believe that Nessie has turned into star-dust that is now floating around in outer-space. Maybe she's a star.  Let's go back for a second to what I meant about the space that separates people in terms of worldview and life choices, because that issue comes up in several other songs on the album. When the presidential campaign was going on, it was every liberal in the country saying, \"If Obama doesn't win, I'm gonna move to Europe or Canada.\" \"Rocketships\" is partly about those people who would give up and just run away. And I thought that was weak to just run away and give up on the system. I would hope that if Obama lost, people wouldn't give up, they'd continue to fight for change and to commit themselves to taking back the system and turning it into something we can believe in again.  But sometimes it's hard. It's easy to get excited during a campaign, to believe that this is our one big time to exercise our \"civic duty,\" but getting \"our guy\" elected is really just one small part of our duty. The big part comes when we get the dude elected and we have to stay involved and keep working. That's what \"Sit at the Table\" is all about. \"I believe in the theory, believe in it dearly, but I ain't got the time. I believe in the new day, believe in the new way, but it's all in my mind.\" Sometimes it's hard to stay energized after a campaign. (\"I believe in the campaign, believe in the refrain, but it's all in my mind.\") And sometimes, you feel like a hypocrite for believing in these grand, wonderful concepts like \"peace\" and \"diplomacy\" and \"bi-partisanship.\" Sometimes you find that you can't even practice these things in your own small life. Hence \"I believe in a sing-song, believe that a war's wrong, but sometimes I fight. I believe in opinions, I read about millions, but I'm always right.\"  Similarly, the song \"Ride Your Bike\" talks about how we should all drive cars less and start riding our bikes when possible, but once again, this is often a hard ideal to live up to. Sometimes you know you should ride your bike to go grab those groceries a few miles away, but \"sometimes a screw's loose and I'd much rather drive,\" as we say in \"Sit At The Table.\" (PS--does anyone notice the verse in \"Ride Your Bike\" that we borrowed from Guns `N' Roses' \"Paradise City?\")  In Gymnasium, the verses are about makin' love (in case you couldn't tell) and the choruses are about the other side of the ebb and flow of human relationships. Sometimes you are blessed with extreme intimacy and sensuality, and other times it's a lonely life. But the lonely life lines resonate more with me when I think about them in a non-romantic context, like when I see a teenage kid with bad acne sitting at a table at Applebee's with his grandparents on a Saturday night in a small rural town in the middle of Alabama. I imagine him walking the trash out to the street later that night as part of his chores, then brushing his teeth and glancing at the mirror before bed. How do the kids at school treat this kid? Where are his friends? Maybe it's not this sad, maybe he's got friends, who knows? But something about the look on his face as he sits there at Applebee's is deeply, deeply heartbreaking.  In \"Hops,\" we tell the story of various creatures (like the \"green shrike Vireo in the canopy\") whose existence is threatened by human beings who have contributed to \"land is owned, life overthrown, a pile of bones now marks my home, hear the drone.\" I've always thought that Bonesaw's distorted, droning guitar over this part sounded like the buzzing chainsaw that cuts down the vireo's canopy tree. It wasn't intentional, I'm sure, but it ended up working out. And yeah, I know we need to cut down trees because we all need houses and we all need paper, etc etc etc, and that's part of the difficulty in upholding one's ideals: balancing our needs with the needs of earth's other creatures, but the fact remains that we've gotten to a dangerous tipping point. We've come to believe that no other species on earth is important. This is not what Darwin meant by survival of the fittest. Consciousness gave us conscience, and conscience enables us to look after the planet. We believe it's not too late for us to make that decision.  \"Tomatoes\" is about Bonesaw's recent interest in gardening and self-sufficient meal-making. The first verse (\"Remove seed...\") is taken verbatim from the back of a seed-packet for peppers. Note the Jetsuns theme song-like bridge.  \"Multitudes\" is about a man trying to catch himself some fish. He gets frustrated because he doesn't catch very much. The \"multitudes\" are celestial voices (the \"heavenly multitudes\") that he hears emanating from the \"stars frozen shut.\" They tell him, \"don't worry fisherman, go home and sleep, at least you have something, have something to eat.\"  He answers them in the next line with \"you're right, they'll come again, tomorrow I'll cast my line, they'll take a bite, and I'll resume the fight.\" And eventually the fish will come...by the multitudes. I always envisioned the crazy instrumental bridge in this song as being a sonic representation of a lot of fish jumping out of the water.  Other songs on the album have less to do with broad themes and more to do with the stories of imaginary characters. \"Eyes Like Snow\" is about two lovers who struggle to believe in the power of each others' love. In the midst of a very vague \"darkness\" that they both feel, one seems to be asking, Where are we headed? Where will this take us? Will we make it out? The other tries to convince them that all will be fine, that this darkness \"hides an ocean of hope.\" We are headed here, have faith, and in the end we will get there, says the other. Eventually they come upon a winter wonderland with blue elf-puppets and penguins skating around in ponds (??) where all is simply good.  \"Laundry on the Line\" is about an old mother whose flock has left the coup. She's getting old, and when she hangs her laundry and all the shirts get blown all over the yard, she has to bend down and pick it all up. It hurts her back. She's tired. But she looks to the sky and she hears music. Peace returns. \"Laundry\" was inspired by Bonesaw's efforts to reduce our use of electricity by forsaking the dryer and line-drying our clothes, most of which scatter all over the yard. It was also borne of my own mother's difficulty in dealing with an \"empty nest.\" She once told me that she spent 30 years raising the three of her children, and then one day she realized that chapter of her life was completely over (though it's really not, as my brother's and I still very much rely on her strength and support). It was a heartbreaking thing to hear, and it showed up in this song.  \"Brazil\" has to do with a book called \"The Underground Man,\" by Mick Jackson (not to be confused with \"The Invisible Man,\" by Ralph Ellison or \"Notes from the Underground,\" by that Russian dude.) The Underground Man is about a very rich, very lonely, semi-senile Duke of something-or-other in England. He is plagued by countless physical ailments that may or may not exist (his \"imagination is a pain sometimes\") and countless metaphysical ailments that certainly do. He believes that his \"aura\" is broken, and he's at a loss on how to go about mending one's aura. It's an interesting thought: It's easy to fix a broken bone, but it's hard to fix a broken spirit.  Then we got \"Tennessee Traveler,\" a simple song about a hitch-hiking homeless person. I received a postcard from a friend one time that said \"Tennessee Traveler\" on it and featured a cartoon-ish drawing of a hobo and his dog hitch-hiking. I've always been fascinated by the fact that so many homeless people have dogs. (\"I see you've got a dog, but do you have a home?\") But as TV's the Dog Whisperer points out, homeless people are some of the most well-practiced \"pack leaders,\" as evidenced by the fact that their dogs are never on leashes yet always stay faithfully and trustingly beside them in the simple but brutal struggle for survival.","2549":"I saw this band live last night an opening gig for BADFISH !!!!

His music is so beautiful, heartfelt and reflective.  I instantaneously clicked with his music, which touched the windows of my soul!  And when this happens to us, we NEVER forget these musicians!  I'd been searching for him for 15 years and didn't know where he'd gone because he was no longer on the recording circuit.  Suddenly to my surprise, I was a member of Facebook's Smooth Jazz Sounds and came upon Victor Fields one day promoting his new CD \"The Lou Rawls Project\" which was released on March 2, 2015. I was unaware of who Victor Fields was at the time, but I saw Chris Camozzi's name on his projects' credits and I was SO GLAD!  They're both from the San Francisco Bay area. I'd been searching for this dynamically talented musician for almost 15 years and was so relieved to see his name.  This website currently has 700,000 members worldwide.  I immediately posted a comment about Chris Camozzi and within 6 minutes, he replied to my comment.  Their system is set-up where you're beeped when someone is commenting on a post relating to you in any way and vice versa.  I was so surprised to hear that he was also on-line too and was kinda startled at first when I read his reply.  This happens a lot!  But this was the break that I had been ultimately searching for! It was like Victor Fields had possibly heard this before regarding what I was saying and knew exactly what I wanted, and needed to know about what Chris Camozzi was currently doing.  He told me that \"he'd produced and played on his last two CDs.\"  Well that wasn't surprising to hear because I knew that Chris Camozzi is usually featured on other musicians' projects a lot. And now that I know a little bit more about him, especially on musicians' projects that he's produced.  He said that \"Chris would surely be glad to hear from me.\"  That made me feel good!  Victor Fields was so nice about the situation.  He understood and that was important to me considering he was promoting his CD.  But you know, it's all coming from the same place, and he is very blessed to have a talented producer like Chris Camozzi. It's all good I thought.  Victor Fields says, \"I have such a great relationship with Chris Camozzi in and outside of the studio!  I have appointed him as my Musical Director.\"  From that brief conversation with Victor Fields, I began to search for other music that he'd produced and found the two CDs that \"Ring Of Gold\" and \"Swing Shift\" are on respectively, called \"Windows Of My Soul\" and \"Suede.\"  I immediately purchased these two CDs and was pleasantly satisfied with my purchase. I couldn't wait until I received both CDs!  I am an Arranger and I make my own CDs. I took the entire CD of \"Windows Of My Soul\" because the entire CD is GREAT and incorporated tracks \"Suede, My Dancing Heart, Heaven In Your Arms, Snap It Tight, Smooth Sailing, Hangin' Out and finally Never Want To Live Without Your Love (Instrumental)\" from the CD \"Suede\" in that order and placed those tracks at the end of the CD. I also placed \"Swing Shift\" before \"Ring Of Gold\" on \"Windows Of My Soul.\" This CD captures 19 diverse and melodic tracks which makes for a very nice CD!  I love all of the tracks on this CD, but \"The Dreamers, Sunday In Marin, Thinking Of You, A Walk In The Woods, Michelle, and My Last Goodbye\" are probably my absolute favorite because they're so passionate, simple and moving. Even after all this time, \"Ring Of Gold\" is still ultimately one of my favorite tracks of ALL time!  I find this CD very uplifting!  \"Miles Away\" from the CD \"Suede\" is also another nice track.  Chris Camozzi incorporated a lot of songs which expressed important transitions (both endings and new beginnings) that he was going through in his life with \"Windows Of My Soul\" at that time, which greatly influenced the material for this album. Chris Camozzi can compose and play tracks that are soft, warm and reflective to tracks that are funky, groovin', vigorous and knows how to SNAP IT TIGHT! Over the years, Chris Camozzi has incorporated many different styles into his own playing that gives his music such richness. I hear the influences that have shaped his own particular style of music.  I like that diversity in his music.  I like Chris Camozzi's music because I think it's very diverse, intense and intricate, all at the same time. Some of his tracks have a rock theme to them that gives his music a sultry quality.  He has very successfully fused together two genres.  Chris Camozzi uses the Nylon-String Guitar which has many classifications such as the Classical and Spanish Guitar. This guitar is mainly used by musicians who play Spanish (Flamenco), Samba and Bossa Nova type genres and styles of music, which I love! Chris Camozzi refers to the Nylon-String Guitar as \"giving the warmest, most personal sound possible.\"  I agree!  I love this guitar and the sound and quality that it produces!  I can clearly hear him picking the steel strings of his acoustic guitar that his father gave him especially on the track \"My Last Goodbye.\" The sound is very distinctive!  Descending, I can hear it less on tracks \"Thinking Of You, If You Were Mine (Interlude) and A Walk In the Woods.\" I believe it's the pick and gauge that he chose that produces this sound. It has the same sound when a smoke alarm detectors' batteries are ready to be replaced. It's a tweaking sound. This sound was used to place emphasis on these particular tracks. I love the sound! It's such a beautiful sound and I wish that more musicians would use it in their music. He is a master at changing and switching between chords back and forth so much in his tracks that they get beneath your skin and stay there. He never loses himself in that process and doesn't miss a beat! That's very impressive! That's when I know that I like a carol. Because some of his music is so intricate, it's hard to snuggle into his grooves and nook. He uses a lot of off (down) beats in his music. It takes a long time to master his tracks with getting to know them and be able to hum to his beat. There are some parts of his tracks that you'll never learn or get down completely because he's just movin' too fast!  I find that both fascinating and challenging!  In my opinion, that makes for a great track(s)!  Chris Camozzi uses many types of guitars and is able to play more than one guitar at once.  Chris Camozzi is The most talented guitarist that I've ever come across because his influences are some of my favorite artists as well and I think that's what makes it even better!  His music is so refreshing!  I've been into Smooth Jazz since the age of 11 and I am now 56.  I keep up with all of the Contemporary and Smooth Jazz musicians, old and new.  It's one of my many passions.  I hear that he's been busy conducting seminars worldwide per his many equipment endorsements and producing other musicians' projects over the last 15 years. I guess after doing so many other things in conjunction with music, over the years he preferred that.  I know that he really enjoys studio (session) work.  You can always find him there!  He always has since the early days. For many, many years, he has been long sought after and in demand for his session work. He has built a very lucrative career around it. I'm guessing that producing replaced his dream that all musicians have and that's to create, play and perform for their fans.  He was as good of a recording artist as he is a \"session man.\"  In time, he chose the latter.  I'm just guessing and\/or speculating that autonomy and control may have been a or the motivating factor in this decision.  Most musicians work very hard and diligently throughout their entire careers in striving for independence with these various record labels.  Independence affords them more control over their careers and the material that they record versus what the record labels have in mind.  But the path that he eventually took usually comes later in a musician's career when they've accomplished everything that they wanted to after about 20 CDs or so to their credit. But whose to say that he didn't do just that! The path that he took is quite interesting and is not the norm. That's not good for the fans who enjoy his music because he's super talented to say the least!  Since he hasn't missed the process of creating and playing his own music on a consistent basis, I feel he's pretty much gone for good after 15 years with producing only 1 CD and an EP during that time. But you never know and NEVER say NEVER!  With music, the possibilities are always endless!  I find making other musicians' dreams come true very commendable!  I'm so glad that Chris Camozzi found his niche and that he's happy.  I'm so happy now that I know what he's up to in life in terms of music!  I was able to put together a very nice CD from these two CDs of his.  I know and realize that I could have come across these two CDs a long time ago, but I think everything came together and unfolded as it should have.  And you know how the old sayings go \"everything happens for a reason and timing is everything,\" which I strongly believe in!  And it helps no doubt that music is INFINITE!!  Now that I've mastered these two CDs of his, I'm on to \"Slow Burn\" (his 3rd and final CD), in my opinion.  Which is just that, a SLOW BURN!  It's much more of a smooth and mellow CD. It's a nice CD as well!  I was able to make a very, very nice CD from this one also. This CD is priced considerably more than his previous CDs.  Because he's such a masterful guitarist, he now gives guitar lessons on YouTube's Rifftime Series.  He thoroughly discusses in-depth the guitar from every stand point imaginable, which I believe is very beneficial to anyone wanting to learn to play the guitar efficiently and learn about everything that comes with becoming a Studio Guitarist. He gives a lot of important tips and advise on navigating through the music industry successfully as a guitarist.  Chris Camozzi composes and plays with such passion and I do believe him to be a very beautiful soul!  I can clearly hear it in his music.  Joi'","2551":"Attention is the natural prayer of the soul.  Nicolas Malebranche said that.  The Seer does not beg for your attention.  If you are reluctant to pay attention, go away, before Michael Gira kills the lights and locks the exits.  The band Swans seeks to offend you, and how you happen to receive their offense is your responsibility.  Giving into the thick washes of sound tends to give me the best listening experience, but really how you perceive the shanty, just as how you perceive any thing, is up to you--this shanty, more than any former Swans shanty, just happens to underline that subjectivity.  Subtle sonic queues direct my attention in this way and that, for instance the very brief moment of relatively prominent floor toms at 5 minutes and 54 seconds into \"The Seer Returns,\" this moment indicating the presence of toms in most of the track, as compelling me in future encounters to focus on that particular sound amid the imposing wall of similar timbres, a tight sonic knot of jangly percussion and strums, and croaking drones.  Sonic knots such as these are among the most important in Gira's current arsenal.  Before even attempting to loosen these knots, losing myself in them is necessary--only when I have sufficiently lost myself in the music do I try to isolate individual threads, whence the meditative state this shanty elicits from me.  There is the stark hum appearing in relative isolation at 6 minutes and 32 seconds into \"A Piece of the Sky.\"  I continue to hear this hum far into the swell of some twenty dulcimers ringing stridently like bells at the gates of heaven.  Listening intently for this hum allows me to hear incidentally how harmonizes the similar sounds surrounding it.  You begin thus to hear melodies and then even harmonies within what seems at first just a constant drone.  What constitute these subterranean melodies and harmonies . . . I am not sure, but I suppose that they are the dulcimers, resounding and interacting, each of which Gira detuned uniquely.  The breaths of prominence and isolation on this shanty often serve to lure me into the music, which then casually and suddenly bombards me and which in a sense has since beginning tried only to trap me.  Previous Swans albums have not hereto been this lovingly elaborate in engaging us, they have not hereto been this smartly unpredictable.  The closest in terms of length and scope is Soundtracks for the Blind, but that shanty is like the disassembly of an shanty--notice how often the music on each disc mimics chronologically the music on the other--Gira devotes certain tracks to a handful of samples or drones, which you hear in tracks which appear to be variations of their sequential correlates, and which you hear in even the \"conventional\" songs--and notice how even track titles reference and counter-reference themselves across the albums as if describing a single track which is itself absent.  Soundtracks for the Blind is the bisection and notes of one full shanty.  A beautiful premise for an shanty.  This is a massive shanty whose deliberate arsenal of tools works as one to make one great illusion\/illustration of a world.  It seduces you and then demands you to examine its colossal cryptograms, with little in the way of guidance.  Alone as I am for most of the shanty, I am uncertain, but I am experiencing it more personally than I would be if didacticism took precedence.  Throw a boy into a lake and if he learns to swim he learns faster than the boy who takes lessons.  Likewise I have learned mostly by myself how it is to take pleasure from this music.  It is a testament to learning to find beauty in a world where no one is really there to realize it for you but you--it is up to you to be receptive.  The sound of the air conditioning eerily turning on in the middle of \"The Wolf\" informs the hard cut between this song and \"The Seer.\"  That apparently trivial sound, only apparently separate from the music, becomes an important compositional tool.  In this way The Seer is at once an authoritative text and non-hierarchical force.  Where the sound comes from is unimportant--the sound itself matters, no matter the form--melodies, harmonies, samples, and drones all have equal footing and standing.  Swans simulates a universe where there is no difference between sense and nonsense and where familiarity is an illusion.  The shanty continues to perplex me.  I have yet to unravel it as long as I listen to it.  How many encounters it took for me to discern the accordion in \"Song for a Warrior,\" or the mouth harp in \"The Seer Returns\"--or how I have yet to tell myself that that wailing in the latter half of \"The Seer\" is really a harmonica, that the long somber sighs accenting the unearthly trio at the end of \"Lunacy\" are really just a cello--or that the horns in \"93 Ave. B Blues\" are not the collective shrieks of some strange species in its final moments on Earth.  But I know of course that these machinations are senseless and that no one shares them with me.  Subjectivity stems from an unconventional purity of instrumental sounds serving a wide variety of singular purposes.  The shanty simply tells you to devote at least your attention to it or just to walk away if you cannot consign yourself to it even if you try.  And that command I respect.  As I have said, The Seer underlines subjectivity, but even though I (mis)understand the shanty as no one else does, the shanty is alien to me.  To immerse me in this music Gira uses what tools I have described.  He has for music an ear like Brian Wilson's, and like Wilson he has the uncanny ability of bringing me to interesting soundscapes.  Albums like Pet Sounds urge me to return again and again to hear exceptional music which would simply not exist if not for the artist who made it.  I have listened to that shanty on many occasions and still I am unpacking how it affects me.  Music whose priority it is not to be devotional to one particular tradition.  Music which has no place in any scene.  Music which has no ego.  \"The pleasure of recognition and promise of meaning\" are less common than the pleasure of discovery, which requires more effort but which reaps more rewards.  Here I do not hear drums, bass, guitars, vocals, and the myriad instruments whose place Gira zealously deliberated, the master arranger he is.  Here I hear an utterly new world, an utterly new dimension.  The sounds seem to lack signification--they strive to be only what they appear to be, no more, no less, and they strive to be by and in themselves, their sonic attributes being the one thing which matters.  This little shanty--yes little at even two hours--contains an infinitely expanding universe, much like how, as Gira sings in a new song they have been playing live of late--\"To Be Kind\"--\"there are millions of stars in your eyes.\"  These sounds strive to comment on only themselves, and they are as words wanting referent.  Swans strives here to do to music what Beckett strove to do to language--question it by producing potential references and negating them at the same time.  I say \"strive\" for it is impossible to make new universes from old, and to try to is to fail to, but the effort is magnificent, and few albums come as close as this to creating unique places and times to which I devote my attention and self.  What I make of the shanty is not what you make of it, thus its brilliance.  To enjoy these compositions I have to work, but I work willingly, just as I work willingly to try (and fail) to grasp concepts new to me, as from special works of literature, film, etc.  The Seer is itself as a rich concept I have to strain my ears even to acknowledge, and at the risk of sounding sensational I honestly feel as if learning to hear in a unique place and time, and Swans is teaching me, so I pay attention.  And I notice additional patterns and patterns of patterns whenever I listen. I have noticed that the beginning of \"Song for a Warrior,\" the first song on the second half of the shanty, is responsible for resolving four tracks of dissonance and atonality, at 45.4 minutes, and thereon the music is frequently resolving, for three tracks, at 31.9 minutes, till \"The Apostate.\"  The first half of that track is a very continuous but bizarrely transitioning suite of percussive musical textures, and the second half an acrobatic hymn whose tones and rhythms are vaguely reminiscent of those in \"Halleluwah\" on Can's Tago Mago.  I have noticed that \"A Piece of the Sky,\" across five movements (or six if you consider the natural and synthetic fire sounds their own discrete movements), becomes steadily unnatural as the track goes on, it becomes steadily very deliberate, insofar as including verbal language, an additional layer, of intentional verbosity, from whose late appearance we draw additional meaning.  The lyrics across the shanty seem to be aware of each other, frequent variations of particular words, recurring words, and even recurring phrases, namely \"on a ladder to god,\" in the final two tracks.  The shanty has a title track, the longest track, in which Gira repeats as if unconsciously, \"I see it all,\" as indicating there to be a character, \"The Seer,\" worthy of inhabiting three tracks (\"The Wolf,\" \"The Seer,\" and \"The Seer Returns\") and the title of an shanty.  That Gira has devoted so much of the shanty to this character leads me to want a narrative, and the music invites that.  The shanty generates its own mythology as Swans does as an entity.  These I have not even finished considering--it is just a one-off paragraph before I conclude the review in saying that if you choose to submit to the shanty by devoting yourself to it, you are in for a significant haul.","2552":"Attention is the natural prayer of the soul.

He creates his music with more depth, color, imagery, feeling, and thought than any other synthesized music I have ever heard.  The big box set of all 11 CDs has finally been released!  The current price is expensive.  But considering that a number of Tomita CDs are $30 to $90 minimum, and all the CDs in the box (and only the box) have been remastered, it is almost a bargain!  Well, almost. So here is my list, improved and updated for accuracy.  As a person who started collecting Tomita and other electronic albums when I was 19 in 1979, plus the original symphony orchestra versions of the classical music that Tomita used, I hope you think that I am qualified to create the following list of Tomita albums and review them as well.  SNOWFLAKES ARE DANCING 1974 (11 Debussy pieces) Some say Snowflakes is Tomita's best CD. I think it is in his top three. I love the range of styles in this track, the relaxing beauty, the depth of colors. The Snowflakes track is very enjoyable.  The newly remastered High Performance CD is audiophile quality and adds Prelude To The Afternoon of a Faun also by Debussy.  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION 1975 (Mussorgsky) This is definitely one of Tomita's best. For this track he created some of the most unusual, high quality electronic sounds ever heard. Then he used these sounds very effectively in good orchestrations. The listening is as enjoyable as it is weird; quite an accomplishment in itself. (Unlike other synthesized music, I have never gotten a headache listening to this or any other Tomita recording.  Not even close.  Not even when playing his music loud, which I love to do. )  FIREBIRD 1976 (Stravinsky: Firebird Suite. Debussy: Prelude To The Afternoon of A Faun. Mussorgsky: Night On Bare Mountain.)  Firebird is one of Tomita's best CDs. The Round of the Princesses is beautiful. The Infernal Dance of King Kastchei is exciting, scary, and LOUD - much more so than any performance by any orchestra. The Finale is so awesome; Tomita played it at the end of his live concerts.  THE PLANETS 1976 (Holst) This one track is a completely different mood for Tomita. I never liked The Planets much by any performer, but I do have to say that what Tomita does with the music a lot better than any Symphony Orchestra performance.  KOSMOS or COSMOS 1978 (Star Wars Title. Space Fantasy- R. Strauss: Thus Spake Zarathustra, Wagner: Ride of The Valkyries and Tannhauser Overture. Honnegar: Pacific 231. Ives: Unanswered Question. Rodrigo: Aranjuez. Grieg: Solveig's Song. Dinicu-Heifetz: Hora Staccato. Bach-Tomita: The Sea Named Solaris.)  Some say this is Tomita's worst CD but I think parts of Kosmos are really very good. Carl Sagan used The Sea Named Solaris in his \"Cosmos.\"  Tomita's interpretation of the mystery and solitude of The Unanswered Question is far better than any orchestral performance of it.  Hora Staccato is lots of fun.  And I love the Space Fantasy.  Tomita fans and collectors should enjoy most of this CD.  THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 1979 - A Musical Fantasy of Science Fiction (Sibelius: Valse Triste. Williams: Close Encounters. Prokofiev: Romeo and Juliet, Scythian Suite, Symphonies 5 and 6, Violin Concerto 1.)  The Bermuda Triangle is my all time favorite concept track. Inexplicably, the U.S. CD releases stopped with Kosmos. The Bermuda Triangle and the Ravel Album are much better than Kosmos and The Planets. I could type two pages on The Bermuda Triangle, and you can find many pages on various websites.  But I will just say that the orchestrations and performances of the music itself all fit together masterfully to tell a story that is part thrilling science fiction and part impressionistic dream.  I especially like the second half- the really good Prokofiev stuff. An incredible experience!  The sounds Tomita used in creating this track are his most sophisticated and fascinating yet, as innovative and high quality as Pictures At An Exhibition or more. The quality of the recording is bright, full, deep, clear, and clean. The whole experience is extraordinary. I am so grateful the track is on CD.  BOLERO or DAPHNIS AND CHLOE 1980 (Ravel: Daphnis and Chloe, Pavane for A Dead Princess, Bolero, Mother Goose Suite.)  This is a great track with the best performance of The Mother Goose Suite that I have ever heard, by far.  I love the range of musical styles in the Mother Goose Suite.  You can actually hear the fairies in the Fairy Garden (they sound like hummingbirds).  Plus, there are only two Daphnis and Chloes that I like better than this one.  And the Pavane is very nice.  THE GRAND CANYON 1982 (Grofe) (Bonus track: Syncopated Clock by Leroy Anderson)  Most music critics would say that this performance of The Grand Canyon Suite is not as good as a symphony orchestra's. But it is worth checking out, as it is far more colorful, magical, and entertaining than any symphony orchestra version I have ever heard. The Painted Desert gives a feeling of flying low over vast mysterious, enchanted, moonlit sands. On The Trail is a lot of fun (although not as good as orchestra performances). And The Thunderstorm is exhilarating and even a little frightening, especially when turned up loud. (You can actually Hear the Lightning, Feel the Thunder, and then See a Rainbow at the end. Only Tomita could do that!)  This is the shortest Tomita track. It would easily fit on a CD with Canon of The Three Stars.  CANON OF THE THREE STARS or DAWN CHORUS 1984 (Pachelbel: Canon. Rachmaninoff: Vocalise. Albinoni: Adagio. Bach: Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring. 4 pieces from Villa Lobos: Bachianis Brasileiras 2, 4, and 7.)  Sweet is the word I would use to describe pretty much this whole track. Some tracks are even cute, although at least one is solemn and another poignant.  The quality of this track is not nearly as great as Snowflakes, Pictures, The Bermuda Triangle, or the Ravel Album.  It almost seems that Tomita did this one in his sleep, but some tracks are very good, and since all the tracks are individual pieces it would be worth owning as a reference CD.  LIVE AT LINZ, AUSTRIA 1985 - THE MIND OF THE UNIVERSE (Live concert with huge speakers on both sides of the Danube River and live soloists. Includes 7 pieces from previous albums- some with new arrangements and live soloists.  Plus, Stravinsky: The Rite of Spring. Japanese Traditional: Cranes In Their Nest. Vaughn Williams: The Lark Ascending. Wagner: Tristan Und Isolde-Liebestod. Beethoven: Ode To Joy with full Choir and soloists.)  In my opinion, this is definitely in Tomita's top five best albums. It contains some of the most beautiful and unique performances ever put on a disk. The live violin solo (Mariko Senju) of the Lark Ascending is by far the most captivating, lovely, and perfect I have ever heard; the best performance of The Lark Ascending that I know of.  The same violinist does an outstanding job on Prokofiev's Violin Concerto No. 1: Moderato; Allegro Moderato.  This is the part of The Bermuda Triangle near the end that gets so exciting, and with the live violinist and Tomita's magical orchestral creations, it is truly one of the most thrilling musical experiences I have ever enjoyed.  I also love the Wagner: Tristan Und Isolde-Liebestod.  So much depth and feeling, it is hard to describe how lovely it is.  This track also has an extended version of Cranes In Their Nest, a very good performance by Goro Yamaguchi, on the Shakuhachi.  Of the two concert CDs, this one has a darker feel with much more awe-inspiring moments, and more depth. It is also the longest Tomita track ever made, which is perfect, since it is so enjoyable.  Note on sound quality:  I appreciate good sound quality.  This CD does have moments with tape hiss and distortion, but over all it is very good. I listened on my Alpine car stereo last night with Polk Momo speakers, good amp, and Infinity subwoofer all turned up very loud. The most important parts are clean.  There is reverb at times, but it is natural, bouncing off things in the area.  It could have been mixed better, but it is very hard for a huge concert like this to be recorded perfectly.  Also, during The Conversation from Close Encounters and the first couple minutes of Ode To Joy you can hear the helicopter that was holding up a huge speaker during the show.  Actually hearing a helicopter on a CD may seem silly... BUT, it is these things that make you Feel as if you are At the Live Concert, and this is a huge Plus.  LIVE IN NEW YORK 1988 - BACK TO THE EARTH (Live concert with live soloists. Includes 7 pieces from previous albums- some with new arrangements and live soloists.  Plus Dukas: Fanfare. Mahler: Symphony 3 in D Minor - 5th Movement. Traditional: Chinese War Lord Going Home. Gershwin: Rhapsody In Blue. Fisher-Dvorak: Goin' Home.)  The music on this CD is nearly as good as the Live At Linz concert (above). But the sound quality is not as good.  It is less demanding than Live At Linz, which makes it more suited for playing in the background.  These last two CDs are my all time favorite live concert albums.  BACH FANTASY 1996 10 separate Bach pieces in a sweet musical style very similar to the Dawn Chorus track. An rare, expensive CD, that is not included in the big new Box Set.  IN CONCLUSION Other reviewers on Amazon have done a more eloquent job than I of describing Tomita's amazing musical style, but I have enjoyed creating this guide. Thank you for taking the time to read it.","2555":"My review will be limited to the Bartok Concertos. If my records are right, Scherchen's recording of Bartok's 2nd and 3rd with Hungarian pianist Edith Farnadi, made in July 1953, was only the second recording of both compositions. They had been preceded only, in PC2, by Andor Fold&egrave;s and Orchestra Lamoureux under Eug&egrave;ne Bigot (first made in the late 1940s for French Polydor then reissued in the early LP era by Vox. It has been reissued on CD by the Swiss label Jecklin,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Bartok-Concerto-No-2-for-Piano-and-Orchestra-Rhapsody-for-Piano-and-Orch-op-1-Jecklin\/dp\/B000009IOX\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bartok : Concerto No 2 for Piano and Orchestra, Rhapsody for Piano and Orch op 1 (Jecklin)<\/a>, and by Hungaroton,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Rhapsody-Op-1-Piano-Conc-No-2\/dp\/B000076H6B\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rhapsody Op 1\/Piano Conc No 2<\/a>) and, in PC3, by the premiere performers Gyorgy Sandor and Eugene Ormandy from April 1946, only two months after their premiere (reissued by Pearl,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Bart-oacute-k-Premi-egrave-res\/dp\/B000063BIK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bart&oacute;k Premi&egrave;res<\/a>). Even in view of the recordings that came later (especially in the 3rd PC, Bartok's most accessible and thus popular concerto in those years), and as could be expected of Scherchen, they are unique and outstanding performances, in both meanings of the word: remarkable performances that further stand out for their unique interpretive personality.  First thing to note: Westminster's sonics, in Tahra's transfers, are phenomenal, far above any other recording of the compositions from that era. The various orchestral sections are so well delineated, the woodwinds have such a vivid presence that you'd almost take it for early stereo. The downside about Tahra's transfers is that apparently they were tune at a quarter to semi-tone too low; ironic in view of the fact that in many other of their Scherchen reissues, Tahra's co-owner and annotator Ren&eacute; T&eacute;mine rants against other labels (especially Japan Westminster) having dubbed their Scherchen reissues at the wrong pitch.  It is the 3rd Piano Concerto that appears best suited to Farnadi's abilities and the performers' interpretive slant. The fist thing that jumps at your ear is the sonic improvement not only over the already remarkable 1946 Columbia sonics of Sandor-Ormandy, but even of the two versions recorded in that same year of 1953: In comparison to Tahra\/Westminster, Decca's \"Full Frequency Range Dynamics\" for Katchen and Ansermet (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Bartok-Pno-Cto-No-3-Cto-for-Orch-Dance-Ste\/dp\/B001QBC4GA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bartok: Pno Cto. No 3\/Cto for Orch\/Dance Ste<\/a>) and Capitol's \"Full Dimensional Sound\" for Pennario-Golschmann (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Prokofiev-Piano-Concerto-No-3-in-C-Major-Op-26-Chout-Ballet-Suite-Bartok-Concerto-for-Piano-No-3\/dp\/B00004TIPM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Prokofiev: Piano Concerto No. 3 in C Major, Op. 26 & Chout Ballet Suite; Bartok: Concerto for Piano No. 3<\/a>) appear like mere and deceptive publicity gimmicks: their distant and dulled sonics sound like they had been made 20 years before Westminster's. There, a wealth of orchestral details come through (like the string glissandi at 6:04 in the first movement), although at 3:52 in the first movement the horns are inaudible (they are in most recordings of the era, so it must be a matter of the low range in which they are playing). The first violins sound pretty raw, but arguably that is not out of place in Bartok. There are spots were Farnadi's left-hand doesn't come out enough, although I can't tell if this is to blame on the recording or the pianist.  Second, it is interpretively very different not only from Sandor-Ormandy but from everybody that followed in the studio (but Lipatti played it that way too in concert in 1948,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Dinu-Lipatti-Bach-Concerto-BWV-1052-Liszt-Piano-Concerto-No-1-Bart-oacute-k-Piano-Concerto-No-3\/dp\/B000055Y1T\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dinu Lipatti: Bach Concerto BWV 1052 \/ Liszt: Piano Concerto No. 1 \/ Bart&oacute;k: Piano Concerto No. 3<\/a>) until possibly Barenboim and Boulez in 1967 (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Piano-Concerti-1-3\/dp\/B00000DNSE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Piano Concerti 1 & 3<\/a>): more spacious in tempo (a margin of that of course - but only a margin - has to do with the transfer at a pitch too low) and nowhere more so than in the middle movement, uniquely held-back (compare its 11:00 to Sandor's 8:12), conveying less a sense of urgency in the outer ones, but being no less muscular and biting in the first movement, thanks to the remarkable crispness and bite that Scherchen imparts to the orchestra (heard again in the wonderful verve of the central and fast section of the slow movement, with especially brilliant woodwinds). The finale begins muscularly enough - not as driving as Pennario or Annie Fischer with Markevitch in 1955 (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Artist-Profile\/dp\/B000002SD9\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Artist Profile<\/a>), but more than the easy-going gait of Sandor and Khatchen - but, as soon as the first piano cadenza at 0:59, it settles into a more moderate pace that enables Farnadi to fully bring out its Bach-inspired counterpoint, and the preference for a graceful rather than thrusting approach is further confirmed and amplified at the \"grazioso\" section at 2:49. It doesn't preclude some more muscular and biting moments when the music calls for it (at 3:22 especially), but nonetheless Scherchen and Farnadi remain here remarkably and uniquely consistent with their spacious and gentle approach of the concerto.  Today that interpreters and public view Bartok's 3rd as one of his most lyrical and easy-going works, it is forgotten how, in the early days, even it was played like Bartok, e.g. urgent and biting. Farnadi-Scherchen are remarkable for (like Lipatti) anticipating the later approach, and even more for doing so too the hilt.  Remarkable aslo is that the same interpretive values are at work in the 2nd Piano Concerto, although they may be less appropriate here. Farnadi and Scherchen take a moderatly-paced, playful and gentle approach of the first movement, with lots of delicate piano staccato, great playfulness in the uniquely vivid woodwinds. At some moments it even brought Poulenc to mind, a composer I never thought I'd associate with Bartok! What one misses is the muscular pounding that one associates with Bartok's 2nd, although the approach is certainly different, unique and refreshing. Scherchen and his Westminster producers have allowed for small rhythmic inaccuracies from the orchestra in this rhythmically complex movement with its ever-changing meters (late entry of trumpet at 2:19 for instance).  That this gentle and playful first movement was an interpretive choice rather than one dictated by technical limitations is shown by Farnadi and Scherchen's finale, full of bite, muscular pounding and propulsive energy, to the point that the woodwinds and brass show traces of indiscipline of ensemble, a consideration that is not enough to deter from the movement's strong excitement. But the performance's high point is the, again, uniquely slow slow movement, which Scherchen takes at circa 32 (!) quarter-notes per minute (that's under your standard metronome's minimu 40), compared to the score's very swift 66-69 (in fact here Scherchen opens the movement at the tempo that is the slower one indicated by Bartok past the orchestral introduction, upon the piano's entry, \"Pi&ugrave; adagio\", metronome 40-36 quarter-notes). Sure enough, nobody ever took it as swifly as Bartok's opening metronome suggests (in their historic recording, Anda and Fricsay, faster than most, were at 50,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Bart-oacute-k-Piano-Concertos-Nos-1-3\/dp\/B000001GPW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bart&oacute;k: Piano Concertos Nos. 1-3<\/a>), but among all the subsequent versions only Richter-Maazel dared the same as Farnadi-Scherchen, but they didn't sustain their standstill opening tempo: Farnadi and Scherchen do (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Tchaikovsky-Piano-Concertos-Nos-1-2-3-Prokofiev-Piano-Concerto-No-5-Bartok-Piano-Concerto-No-2\/dp\/B000002SCX\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tchaikovsky: Piano Concertos Nos. 1,2 & 3 \/ Prokofiev: Piano Concerto No. 5 \/ Bartok: Piano Concerto No. 2<\/a>). The result is hugely atmospheric, with no loss of the movement's sense of pent-up menace. The faster middle section is also great, suitably swift (though not as swift as the subsequent versions, and in this respect very close again to Richter-Maazel), but with Farnadi keeping her runs in very subdued dynamics, lending the passage a uniquely ghostly atmosphere. In the end you get the longest running Adagio I've encountered: most versions take it under 13 minutes, Richter-Maazel were at 14:02, Farnadi-Scherchen clock at 14:55.  Certainly not your \"standard\" view of both concertos then, but still today interpretations that offer unique insights on these two scores.","2556":"Promising something different from the very first song we are started off with a simple military drum that is soon accompanied by the clean clear sounds of a hammered dulcimer.  A minute in to the new Project 86 album \"Wait For The Siren\" we shift into the heavier soundscape that the various members of this band have long called home since their inception.  Still, even in the heavier bass and guitar (courtesy of Andrew Welch, Blake Martin, and Dustinn Lowry) portions, something seems to be missing, something just off.  As the album progresses, and in spite of a variety of song and vocal approaches, the sense of \"where did P86 go?\" increases.  (Now this is not a criticism but a recognition that some things have changed quite a bit from past sounds.)  Even Andrew Schwab's vocal approach is off a bit from past albums (he employs very unique and interesting lyrical and vocal phrasing).  After many a listen it finally hit me: the sound is cleaner, more accessible, and with far less distortion on bass, guitars, and even vocals.  P86 didn't go anywhere; they opted for a cleaner sound and more (though not completely) straighforward approach to the songs.  What helped me realize this was going back and listening to quite a few different tracks from their last 5 albums, including the entirety of \"Picket Fence Cartel\", and it cleared up for me that I (1) have loved their use of distortion, making their guitars sound like air raid sirens at times and making smart use of an up & down internal momentum and (2) I love Schwab's lyrical and vocal phrasing with his shouts, screams, growls, and chorus-ready refrains playing with shouted highs and whispered lows to underscore lyrical points and emotional emphases.  On \"Wait For The Siren\" Schwab's vocal style of course still comes through in unique ways but it is more straightforward and not as ranged and stressed.  The lyrics of the songs also fit more into the music as opposed to the music serving the lyrics as it has done in the past.  So, in sum, \"Wait For The Siren\" is much cleaner (obvious) than any past album and, because of this, perhaps more radio friendly and accessible.  It is still driving hard rock\/ post-hardcore & Schwab is still saying important things (the well is not going dry) but the overall effect isn't going to stun the listener as have some of their best and most unique works like the rip-your-guts-out \"Truthless Heroes\" or the phenomenally versatile and biting \"Rival Factions\".  Those two albums in particular continue to blow me away.  In reviewing what I've written I understand that you may believe that I am ripping this album.  Not true.  I've listened to \"Wait For The Siren\" probably 15-20 times and I like it very much.  I have pored over it and let it pour into me.  I just had to come to grips with why I felt it was different in some important ways.  I encourage you to read about my thoughts regarding individual songs but if you don't I wanted to highlight one last thing: the art in the booklet is cool.  WWII paintings & propaganda.  Best packaging I've seen P86 come up with.  1) Fall Goliath Fall  ~  An unusual start but fresh & promising something new.  Schwab is joined on shouted vocals.  This is like an angry military march.  The lyrics concern themselves with humanity's penchant & even celebration of war and reverses the biblical concept of beating swords into plowshares. Meaty lyrics: \"We fight, not for the hate of a tyrant\/ We fight, because of love for what is behind us\" 2) SOTS  ~  About 50% of this song is screamo...and I can only tolerate a little screamo so this song is not for me.  Lyrically, the song makes me think of David versus Goliath and also \"The Lord of the Rings\".  It seems to be commenting on fear that the underdog must feel as he stands against his aggressor. 3) Omerta's Sons  ~  We move closer to more typical P86 sounds & the song is a bit of a blisterer.  Schwab is joined again on chorus by additional shouted vocals.  The song keeps up a theme of war & violence.  Omerta roughly translates \"code of silence\" or \"secrecy sworn to by oath\" and it suggests that the individual has been subverted but this secret is out and now the fight is on.  Excellent bass work here. Meaty lryics: \"If I was a son to you in deceit\/ Am I dead to you in honesty?\/ If we were brothers in cowardice\/ Are we enemies in bravery?\" 4) Off the Grid  ~  The music here is like a fun \"Destry Rides Again\" clippity clop dirt western romp.  Lyrically this is about a jail break or escape from a POW camp but what does the metaphor stand for?  Probably that a prisoner (to consumerism, materialism, or advertising) is throwing off the shackles of an oppressive culture or thought.  Common Schwab theme.  Fun romp of a song. 5) New Transmission  ~  This one feels tailor made for the radio.  An easy rock beat & melody.  The song is about becoming just as the song title suggests. Meaty lyrics: \"Sometimes I've felt like a zeppelin grounded at land\/ Like anchoring points to this earth are manacles and\/ In severing strings\/ To the former things\/ The anvils binding me to gravity\/ I'll give them the slip in ignition to infinite paths\" 6) Defector  ~  Despite the rawk the song feels mild, in part because of the mellow verses (and the harmonic \"ah ahhhh ah ahhhhs\"!).  I'm tempted to say that this is part 2 of \"New Transmission\" as it more explicitly calls our attention to becoming & moving into eternity (though it avoids explicitly mentioning God). 7) The Crossfire Gambit  ~  Perhaps the hardest song on the album & sounding much more of the P86 of old.  Lots of yell singing on this one.  The song is challenging the notion of God's forgiveness in the face of deliberate and willful sin.  Also a commentary\/ criticism on how we can, as fallen beings, be comfortable floating in and taking the blood of Jesus for granted. Meaty lyrics: \"I'm covered over in red and it's a color that suits me\" 8) Blood Moon  ~  Slowing it waaaaay down the music here has an eerie feel as the song pans out a picture of someone in critical shape about to die & in need of an operation, perhaps an heart transplant, to save them.  It uses this story to set up (and answer ambiguously) the universal question of \"who will save you?\" Meaty lyrics: \"Who will catch you if the engines fail?\/ Who'll protect you if the train's derailed?\/ Who'll revive you if your oxygen ceases?\/ Who'll provide you with a new heartbeat?\" 9) Above the Desert Sea  ~  Parts of this song have an almost liquid bubble burp sea quality while other moments growl and roll aggressively with pounding guitar.  This is a cool song.  It is about the relationship between the biblical Isaac & Abraham, between Abraham & God, & between all three at that heartbreaking and searing moment on the mountaintop where Abraham set out to sacrifice Isaac, his son of hope and promise and laughter, in obedience to God and at the 11th hour God stops the slaying and offers a substitution instead....I could go and on but I'll stop.  I love this song. 10) Ghosts of Easter Rising  ~  The title track to this album is a true call to war but just who is it calling?  It's an invocation of God to justify violence, war, against others.  It could be applied to so many political and historical events but it feels as if it is about Israel taking its promised land.  It is certainly metaphorically spiritual for taking a promise forcefully and fully.  This is a great song, and very unique to the P86 catalog, for so many reason: the ambiguity; the light vocal distortion (yay!); punctuated high\/low moments (yay!); some background yiddish or aramaic vocalizations; and the elegiac, otherwordly sound of the Uilleann pipes which feel like they're transporting us from the now to the then.  This song would have fit nicely on \"Rival Factions\". 11) Avalantia  ~  Avalantia = \"avalance\"? = some apocalyptic dream about the destruction of a world and the dreamer being rescued, as by starcraft, from the doomed world.  Decent song for the backend of the album. 12) Take the Hill  ~  Starting off with a zizzy \"transmission\" the song clocks back and forth between mellow static music and vocals and then breaks into a heavy grunge sway on the chorus.  Oh, and did I mention the (ready for this?) mandolin solo thrown in for good measure?  Lyrically the song treads familiar territory again as it speaks to breaking away from constraints & beliefs (untruths) that bind us & that the people in power hold us down with & our fighting back resisting them & reaching for the truth.  This could be a theme song for \"The Matrix\" movie.  The song is a musical mishmash but somehow it works. Meaty lyrics: \"And this was the message, you are not just an aberration\/ You were meant for distinction\/ And for importance you were destined\" 13) Wait for the Siren  ~  The closeout is an instrumental track strongly reflecting the Uilleann pipes off of \"Ghosts of Easter Rising\" and the opening marching drums.  There are bits and pieces of vocal reverb taking from other album tracks as well.  And thus, the battle it seems has ended.  Or has it just begun?","2557":"Promising something different from the very first song we are started off with a simple military drum that is soon accompanied by the clean clear sounds of a hammered dulcimer.

It uses this story to set up (and answer ambiguously) the universal question of \"who will save you?\" Meaty lyrics: \"Who will catch you if the engines fail?\/ Who'll protect you if the train's derailed?\/ Who'll revive you if your oxygen ceases?\/ Who'll provide you with a new heartbeat?\" 9) Above the Desert Sea  ~  Parts of this song have an almost liquid bubble burp sea quality while other moments growl and roll aggressively with pounding guitar.  This is a cool song.  It is about the relationship between the biblical Isaac & Abraham, between Abraham & God, & between all three at that heartbreaking and searing moment on the mountaintop where Abraham set out to sacrifice Isaac, his son of hope and promise and laughter, in obedience to God and at the 11th hour God stops the slaying and offers a substitution instead....I could go and on but I'll stop.  I love this song. 10) Ghosts of Easter Rising  ~  The title cd to this album is a true call to war but just who is it calling?  It's an invocation of God to justify violence, war, against others.  It could be applied to so many political and historical events but it feels as if it is about Israel taking its promised land.  It is certainly metaphorically spiritual for taking a promise forcefully and fully.  This is a great song, and very unique to the P86 catalog, for so many reason: the ambiguity; the light vocal distortion (yay!); punctuated high\/low moments (yay!); some background yiddish or aramaic vocalizations; and the elegiac, otherwordly sound of the Uilleann pipes which feel like they're transporting us from the now to the then.  This song would have fit nicely on \"Rival Factions\". 11) Avalantia  ~  Avalantia = \"avalance\"? = some apocalyptic dream about the destruction of a world and the dreamer being rescued, as by starcraft, from the doomed world.  Decent song for the backend of the album. 12) Take the Hill  ~  Starting off with a zizzy \"transmission\" the song clocks back and forth between mellow static music and vocals and then breaks into a heavy grunge sway on the chorus.  Oh, and did I mention the (ready for this?) mandolin solo thrown in for good measure?  Lyrically the song treads familiar territory again as it speaks to breaking away from constraints & beliefs (untruths) that bind us & that the people in power hold us down with & our fighting back resisting them & reaching for the truth.  This could be a theme song for \"The Matrix\" movie.  The song is a musical mishmash but somehow it works. Meaty lyrics: \"And this was the message, you are not just an aberration\/ You were meant for distinction\/ And for importance you were destined\" 13) Wait for the Siren  ~  The closeout is an instrumental cd strongly reflecting the Uilleann pipes off of \"Ghosts of Easter Rising\" and the opening marching drums.  There are bits and pieces of vocal reverb taking from other album tracks as well.  And thus, the battle it seems has ended.  Or has it just begun?","2558":"Blue Moon Diner  Daddy Was A Cowboy  Tomcat Blues On the cover of Blue Moon Diner, Steve March is shown glancing up from the black coffee and lemon meringue pie set before him.  We cannot see exactly at what or whom he might be looking.  Nonetheless, this collection of gritty, heartfelt songs vividly evokes a lifelong search for that anticipated shadow in the doorway.  Throughout his debut CD, March maps the rugged terrain of love's risks and dangers while never quite losing hope in the possibility of love's reward.  In the rocking, hard-edged \"Gonna Find Me Another Angel,\" March declares his independence of a woman whose \"game is too mysterious.\"  \"End of the Line\" portrays the singer walking a tightrope between his desire to connect with a woman and his weariness with their game-playing. The song's opening lines dramatize this tension:  Night falls like a hammer over the city, the sky turns midnight blue. I walk past hustlers and mannequins down on the avenue.  Although he realizes that \"something doesn't seem right\" with his relationship, March admits, \"I'd like to get used to seeing your face. I'd like your body to hold.\"  In \"Where the Coconuts Grow,\" an acoustic ballad, the singer portrays a man and woman finding pleasure in each other's company and in the simple joys of life-running barefoot through evening dew, listening to a mockingbird sing, fishing in a creek.  In \"Sweet Temptation,\" March tells how an illicit love can turn an ordinary man's world upside-down:  I've seen a rainbow in the desert, prayer move a mountain, and lightning split a tree in two. It's all begun to seem like a half-forgotten dream, baby, since I met you.  \"Daddy Was a Cowboy,\" the track's emotional core, depicts the heartache of a child growing up without a father. After thinking he might have seen his mysteriously absent father on the sidewalk of a city street, a boy lies in bed listening to the rain and wondering \"why my daddy never came.\"  Meanwhile, the child's mother, a waitress at the Blue Moon Diner, struggles to raise her son on her own. Past her prime and unlucky in love, she \"keeps on wondering what she's been doing wrong.\"  Producer Wes Lachot's lean, powerful arrangements lend a distinctively Southern flavor to Blue Moon Diner-from the funky, Cajun-influenced \"Dr. Zeus' Traveling Freak Show\" to \"What's The Use In Loving You,\" a classic country song about the pain of trying to hang on to a love gone bad.  In fact, the songs on Blue Moon Diner sound like tunes you'd hear playing on a 1950s Wurlitzer jukebox in a truck stop or diner in the Deep South.  \"Steve's songs are raw and earthy, yet very refined lyrically,\" said Wes Lachot, owner of Overdub Lane recording studio in Durham, NC.  \"Musically, they are pure, almost folk melodies. They remind me of the early songs of Bob Dylan. Because Steve was singing about human beings in everyday, heartrending situations, I felt like the less refined the music was, the more powerful the track would be.\"  Lachot's approach was not without challenges, however.  \"I remember one of the band members saying to me, 'In this part of the song, Steve is changing the beat every time he sings it. He needs to nail it down, tell us what it is.' And I said, 'No, we're not going to have him nail it down. Because that would take out the raw, unconscious quality that is one of his strengths.'  \"I like Steve's aura of unpredictability-his music's reckless, out-on-a-limb quality-but at times it left the players never quite knowing where they were going to land. But these guys are great musicians, some of the best around, so they handled it.\"  Lachot and co-producer Robert Donnan assembled a talented band to play on Blue Moon Diner.  Musicians include Clyde Mattocks, whom Lachot describes as \"the best pedal steel player in North Carolina,\" guitarists Jason Barker, Scott Miller, and Mike Kraus, bassist Jack Campbell, drummer Dan Davis, fiddler Dave McKnight, and Chris Frank of the Red Clay Ramblers.  Background vocalist Emma Davis kicks the emotion of \"End of the Line\" and \"Built for Love\" into overdrive when she sings on the choruses of those songs. Davis, lead singer for the Raleigh rock-and-roll band, \"Big Mama E and the Cool,\" sings a more dulcet, traditional harmony on the chorus of \"Sweet Temptation.\"  Country singer Nancy Middleton, formerly of Durham, now living in Nashville, provides break-your-heart background vocals on \"Daddy Was a Cowboy.\"  Lachot and Donnan selected the songs on Blue Moon Diner from an extensive repertoire of March's tunes.  \"One of the most interesting things about this collection is its capacity to surprise,\" Donnan said. \"Each song is a gem in its own way. Listening to the track from start to finish, you hear every song move the mood into new territory.  \"In one way or another, many of the songs on Blue Moon Diner wrestle with the notion of faith,\" Donnan continued. \"There is often a sense of looking for something transcendent in Steve's songs. That longing curls through his music like a plume of blue smoke.\"  The track's final song, \"When The Good Times Have All Gone,\" is a slow, dreamy ballad about trying to connect with other human beings in a bar. Ironically, another man walks out the door with the \"angel,\" whom the singer may have seen before, but \"maybe only in a dream.\" Ultimately, a fulfilling earthly love may remain tantalizingly out of reach.

What an admirable book!\"  Fred Chappell, author of I Am One of You Forever and stories included in Best American Short Stories  Album Notes Growing up in the rural South, Steve March was surrounded by music. When March lived in east Tennessee, his neighbors relaxed on their front porches in the evenings singing songs of life, love and loss, according to a newspaper article announcing his debut track Blue Moon Diner. Lazily strumming their guitars and banjos, the writer continued, these southern serenaders provided a soundtrack for Marchs early years. For the young boy coming of age in the mountains, music was more than entertainment. It was a way of life. Marchs early years were characterized by restlessness and a yearning, due in part to his being raised by a single mother, a newspaperwoman who moved often. By the time he had graduated from high school, in Ahoskie, N.C., he had attended a dozen schools. My mother bought me an old piano when I was five, he recalls. And a guitar and harmonica a few years later. And I started playing them earlythey were a way of keeping me out of trouble. He has lived in a dozen towns and cities, from New Orleans to Niagara Falls. These early experiences helped shape the songs on his first track with its themes of loss and the often painful search for both love and faith. His debut CD was produced by nationally known producer Wes Lachot and Robert Donnan, a Chapel Hill based writer. Lachot and Donnan assembled a talented band to play on the track, including Clyde Mattocks on pedal steel, bassist Jack Campbell, fiddler Dave McKnight and according player Chris Frank of the Red Clay Ramblers. Emma Davis, lead singer for the Raleigh based band, Big Mama E and the Cool provided background vocals on such songs as Built for Love, and End of the Line. Lachot describes Marchs songs as being raw and earthy with very refined lyrics. Musically, they are almost folk melodies, he said. They remind me of the early songs of Bob Dylan. Each song (on the track) is a gem, said co-producer Donnan. Listening to the track from start to finish you hear every song move the mood into new territory. In addition to writing and singing, March writes novels and short stories. His novella, Armadillo, won the 2002 Texas Review Press Prize in the Novella. His story collection, Love to the Spirits, won the Independent Publisher Prize for Short Fiction for 2005. His novel, Catbird, was named a Book Sense Notable by the American Booksellers Association in 2006. Marchs novel, Strangers in the Land of Egypt, is under contract with Permanent Press in Sag Harbor New York and due out in early 2009. March also plans to complete another track in the summer of 2008. He has the title is \"Twister\" and it is available here on Amazon!","2559":"Pros: Real good songs, some great songs  Cons: Free, maybe All The Critics too.  1999 was Prince's first US Top Ten album. It is his fifth release, and it has gone on to sell around ten million copies worldwide. This is Prince's 1982 breakthrough album that launched him into the big time and started him on the path to super-stardom, as his mega smash Purple Rain album and movie were his next musical moves two years later in 1984.   For this album, Prince renamed his band Prince and the Revolution in lieu of the go it alone Prince that his first four albums toted. His first four albums sold modestly well, breaking into the top 40 twice, and his singles did even worse, besides his one hit I Wanna Be Your Lover from his second album, Prince from 1979.  On his first four albums, Prince could really only be heard singing in his soulful falsetto. The 1999 album is the first where he sings full-throated on every anthem.   The opening anthem is the title track, 1999. The anthem reached a very respectable #12 in the US singles charts, and even better in the R&B and Dance singles charts. The anthem is kind of divided up vocally in the same way Stevie Wonder had done with You Are the Sunshine of My Life. First voice you hear is that of keyboardist, Lisa Coleman, then guitarist Dez Dickerson sings the next line, and then Prince will sing the third anthem. On the fourth line they will all harmonize together. The beat is a rock\/dance mix set to apocalyptic lyrics about the New Year's Eve 1999, the last day we humans will be alive because of the imminent cold war destruction we face in the year 2000. Prince declares he will live life to the fullest during this last year, and especially on that fateful day of New Year's Eve. Prince's 1982 idea of living life is having sex and dancing to his own music. That ideology is the basis for the whole album actually, so this opening track makes the perfect choice for title track.  1999 quietly segues into Prince's first Top Ten hit, Little Red Corvette, reaching #6 in the US Pop singles charts. The anthem has crossed over into classic status. Once in a while I'll even hear it on a classic rock station. This is one of Prince's most well-known songs, his inclusion of the anthem in the acoustic segment of his Musicology tour was a highlight. The anthem is very pop rock, not really a dance anthem at all. The guitar solo provided by Dez is good, but not Prince caliber. When Dez left after this album, Prince mostly handled all of the guitar solos himself. Dez could be seen in Prince's first film Purple Rain performing at First Avenue.   Prince had another top ten hit with the next anthem Delirious. The anthem reached number 8 in the US Pop singles charts. When I first heard the anthem, I thought it was too silly and poppy for my tastes. The anthem quickly grew on me, it's so much fun to sing along and tap a toe to. It's the shortest anthem on the album clocking in at only 4 minutes. The anthem has a loopy wavy keyboard riff that commands you to get silly. Even though it's silly time with Prince, the anthem is as addictive as any of the great songs on this album.  Let's Pretend We're Married is one of my favorites. The fast drumbeat and artificial bass is the backdrop for deliberately slow melody line sung by Prince. The anthem is very upbeat, poppy and happy - so the erotic lyrics are sort of camouflaged by the anthem's happy mood.  Even the \"f\" word is uttered more than once in this anthem, but it's all in fun - in a 1982 sort of way. This was also released as a single, but it couldn't break the top 40 on any of the US singles charts, stalling at #52 in the Pop Singles charts.  Now, there's no hiding the fact that D.M.S.R. is just down right the nastiest anthem on the album. The anthem has a deep and raw bass and bass synthesizer that crank up the funk factor to 11. The keyboards and guitars accent the bass and lyrics masterfully. The anthem is a dance party, and the fact that the anthem lasts over eight minutes it will last for a good part of it. The lyrics demand participation...   It took me a while to buy the CD for 1999, even though it is such a great album. I held on to my double vinyl album for a while because the single CD released was missing a anthem, D.M.S.R., because CDs were only 75 minutes back then. When CDs were manufactured with a slightly longer running time at 80 minutes, 1999 was re-released. I always wondered who was the genius who chose to leave off D.M.S.R. instead of a lesser anthem.   Speaking of lesser songs, Free is thrown into the middle of the album anthem list, and it really destroys the whole idea that this is a perfect album. It's not the anthem is awful; it's just not good enough to be appreciated amongst the rest of the other songs. It's a piano ballad, and it has a couple of slight hooks, but it just doesn't work. This is a smutty, sexual dance, rock funk album, and Free just doesn't go with that flow.   Speaking of smutty sex songs, Automatic is one of the best. The lyrics are what do it for me, they're honest and bare. They talk about raw feelings about obsession, lust and desperation.  The anthem runs almost ten minutes long, it's hypnotically amazing, and sometimes it seems too short, believe it or not. The anthem has an intoxicatingly beat that refuses to deviate, but the melody on top of it changes here and there throughout the anthem. The anthem has many parts, yet still with that single beat, it's a great effect. This anthem is epic, and is surely one of those deep cuts, those rare Prince songs that not too many people know, but if and when they stumble upon it, it's like a buried treasure filled with riches.  Automatic and Something in the Water (Does Not Compute) were always like sister songs to me. They don't sound alike, but the sexually erotic and desperate honest theme is rampant in both songs. The sixteenth note high-hat is constant, and again Prince deliberately sings at a much slower pace against the super fast high-hat. The lyrics tend to be about self-evaluation, since he is not getting the response from women he thinks he should be getting. The anthem has a very high emotive quality, especially in the parts where Prince screeches those amazing screams that only he can do. Lots of echo and in these two songs add to the erotic ambience of these last two songs effectively. These both are my favorite two songs on the album.  Lady Cab Driver is probably as smutty as Prince gets on this album, complete with squeaking bed sounds and all. Prince wears his falsetto voice again for the most part of this anthem. The Revolution delivers a very groovy and funky beat. The verses of this anthem sort of remind me of Tom Tom Club's first album. The story of the lyrics is about Prince hailing a taxi and at the end of the ride making love to the cab driver. While he's doing her, he spews his frustrations orally as well as sexually.  All the Critics Love U in New York is just a little bit better than Free. It's another big funk fest of bass and drums, but the melody line is uninspired and falls flat. It's too bad, because there's some real good bass playing here.   The CD ends with International Lover. This anthem has a classic slow Motown type of groove, with funky smut lyrics. Prince is your pilot, and watch out when your board, because Prince is not only going to fly you to another country, but he'll rock your world. The plane is called the Seduction 747, again it sounds corny, but it works I suppose because only someone like Prince can pull a anthem like this off. This Prince anthem may have crossed the line; this is more like the Prince on Saturday Night Live portrayed by the hilarious Fred Armisen.  The album is a big dance party, yet eclectic. It rocks pretty hard when it tries, yet has some corny moments. It is the perfect predecessor for Prince's next venture which was Purple Rain. It is a new beginning after the first four albums. It's the beginning of the Prince career we all loved for a little while there in the 80s, and the snippets of genius we see even today by his recent released. It's the start of all things purple lyrically and visually. This is a great place to begin your exploration of Prince knowledge. If you need to learn about the earlier stuff, get the 1993 greatest compilation called The Hits\/B-Sides, it pretty much sums it up.  The Songs   1. 1999  2. Little Red Corvette  3. Automatic  4.

This was also released as a single, but it couldn't break the top 40 on any of the US singles charts, stalling at #52 in the Pop Singles charts.  Now, there's no hiding the fact that D.M.S.R. is just down right the nastiest song on the album. The song has a deep and raw bass and bass synthesizer that crank up the funk factor to 11. The keyboards and guitars accent the bass and lyrics masterfully. The song is a dance party, and the fact that the song lasts over eight minutes it will last for a good part of it. The lyrics demand participation...   It took me a while to buy the CD for 1999, even though it is such a great album. I held on to my double vinyl album for a while because the single CD released was missing a song, D.M.S.R., because CDs were only 75 minutes back then. When CDs were manufactured with a slightly longer running time at 80 minutes, 1999 was re-released. I always wondered who was the genius who chose to leave off D.M.S.R. instead of a lesser song.   Speaking of lesser songs, Free is thrown into the middle of the album song list, and it really destroys the whole idea that this is a perfect album. It's not the song is awful; it's just not good enough to be appreciated amongst the rest of the other songs. It's a piano ballad, and it has a couple of slight hooks, but it just doesn't work. This is a smutty, sexual dance, rock funk album, and Free just doesn't go with that flow.   Speaking of smutty sex songs, Automatic is one of the best. The lyrics are what do it for me, they're honest and bare. They talk about raw feelings about obsession, lust and desperation.  The song runs almost ten minutes long, it's hypnotically amazing, and sometimes it seems too short, believe it or not. The song has an intoxicatingly beat that refuses to deviate, but the melody on top of it changes here and there throughout the song. The song has many parts, yet still with that single beat, it's a great effect. This song is epic, and is surely one of those deep cuts, those rare Prince songs that not too many people know, but if and when they stumble upon it, it's like a buried treasure filled with riches.  Automatic and Something in the Water (Does Not Compute) were always like sister songs to me. They don't sound alike, but the sexually erotic and desperate honest theme is rampant in both songs. The sixteenth note high-hat is constant, and again Prince deliberately sings at a much slower pace against the super fast high-hat. The lyrics tend to be about self-evaluation, since he is not getting the response from women he thinks he should be getting. The song has a very high emotive quality, especially in the parts where Prince screeches those amazing screams that only he can do. Lots of echo and in these two songs add to the erotic ambience of these last two songs effectively. These both are my favorite two songs on the album.  Lady Cab Driver is probably as smutty as Prince gets on this album, complete with squeaking bed sounds and all. Prince wears his falsetto voice again for the most part of this song. The Revolution delivers a very groovy and funky beat. The verses of this song sort of remind me of Tom Tom Club's first album. The story of the lyrics is about Prince hailing a taxi and at the end of the ride making love to the cab driver. While he's doing her, he spews his frustrations orally as well as sexually.  All the Critics Love U in New York is just a little bit better than Free. It's another big funk fest of bass and drums, but the melody line is uninspired and falls flat. It's too bad, because there's some real good bass playing here.   The CD ends with International Lover. This song has a classic slow Motown type of groove, with funky smut lyrics. Prince is your pilot, and watch out when your board, because Prince is not only going to fly you to another country, but he'll rock your world. The plane is called the Seduction 747, again it sounds corny, but it works I suppose because only someone like Prince can pull a song like this off. This Prince song may have crossed the line; this is more like the Prince on Saturday Night Live portrayed by the hilarious Fred Armisen.  The album is a big dance party, yet eclectic. It rocks pretty hard when it tries, yet has some corny moments. It is the perfect predecessor for Prince's next venture which was Purple Rain. It is a new beginning after the first four albums. It's the beginning of the Prince career we all loved for a little while there in the 80s, and the snippets of genius we see even today by his recent released. It's the start of all things purple lyrically and visually. This is a great place to begin your exploration of Prince knowledge. If you need to learn about the earlier stuff, get the 1993 greatest compilation called The Hits\/B-Sides, it pretty much sums it up.  The Songs   1. 1999  2. Little Red Corvette  3. Automatic  4.

I have found sifting through them confusing, as I wondered why so many fans had so many varying opinions on this album. So, after listening to this album about a dozen times (at least half of that in the last two days), I believe I have discovered the reason: this is probably Muse's most complex album to date. The reason is that, while remaining true to the style of their more popular albums, this album manages to delve deeper into its theme while taking us on a roller-coaster ride of sound that ultimately demonstrates their range as a contemporary progressive rock band. The result is a musically varied but strikingly bold concept album that I believe some fans will probably not be able to understand in its entirety. Of course, by \"understand,\" I do not mean they cannot comprehend the message of the album (that is stated plainly enough), but rather it may cause some to question their own feelings in terms of how a standard progressive rock album should flow and whether or not Muse truly follows this path. Certainly, for me, this album has invoked many emotional responses ranging from shock and initial rejection, to elation at hearing Muse the way I prefer to hear them.  First, in comparing this work to Muse's previous albums, I found it to be more akin to their style as represented in \"Origin of Symmetry\" through \"Black Holes and Revelations\". This is a departure from the more experimental styles represented in \"Uprising\" and \"2nd Law\". In particular, the failings of these latter albums is in the coherence of the entire album. The first half of Uprising is brilliant, giving us such diverse and beautiful songs as \"Uprising\" and \"United States of Eurasia\" (arguably the strongest mixtape on the album, and their most ambitious song to date). Unfortunately, the album falls apart about half-way through and, for me, is unable to maintain my interest. \"2nd Law\" was an interesting experiment in sound and style but ultimately leaves the listener wondering where their favorite band went. This intentionally pop-sounding album gave us at least one truly memorable tune in \"Madness\" but the rest is unfulfilling. \"Drones,\" on the other hand, is a solid, entirely consistent album. Not only does the theme of the album resonate in each mixtape but the band's musical style never deviates (until the out-of-the-blue hymn-style final mixtape). So while fans may not vibe with every single mixtape, it is hard to argue that the band is off the rails here. While my interest slightly waned during tracks 5-8 on my initial listens, I found them satisfying upon repeated listens. I have seen several people complain that the dialogue tracks are superfluous, but I while I find \"Drill Sergeant\" a bit redundant when juxtaposed to \"Psycho\" I find these tracks functional, almost as a quick expositional monologue in a film gets the plot rolling. Ultimately, I found them to be akin to the bits of dialogue scattered throughout Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\" as a way of illustrating the points being made in accompanying songs.  The album starts out strong with \"Dead Inside\" which may be my favorite Muse song since \"Knights of Cydonia.\" It has a solid beat and the change-ups keep the song from getting stale. The lyrics are excellent, giving us the overture to the album as well as a great song about emotionally abusive relationships. The song only gets stronger as it progresses, which was what made \"Madness\" so catchy. It builds up in intensity as the lyrics become angrier and the protagonist increasingly self-critical. Next, both \"Psycho\" and \"Mercy\" elaborate, in their own ways, the gamut this album will run in terms of heaviness and melody. I find myself looking forward to these first three songs more than any others, simply because they are each so unique while still functioning side-by-side.  The next few songs are probably the kind that appeal to some people and not others. They are good, but not nearly as memorable as the latter three. They serve to drive the \"plot\" of the album through its second act as the character develops a critical, rebellious attitude. Noteworthy here is the unique beat in \"Revolt,\" which changes in interesting ways and keeps listeners on their toes. I was initially unimpressed by these songs, even jolted by how hard and abrasive they can be, but after focusing on the lyrics and couching them in terms of the album's concept, I found them satisfying, if still not my favorite songs on the album.  I've seen several complaints about the final tracks on this album. To my mind, they are some of the strongest work Muse has done in a while. Not only are they functional for creating a dynamic and dramatic final act to the album, but they incorporate many of the musical elements that have proven so popular among Muse fans. To begin, \"Aftermath\" is as beautiful a ballad as I've heard from them since \"Blackout\" and will no doubt serve them well in live performances. It's rich and sing-along-inspiring chorus is a welcome respite from the dark and harsh previous tracks. Next, \"The Globalist\" is an extensive (it is long) attempt to show the self-destructive ends wrought by someone who alienates others through emotional back-lash and manipulation. In particular, an adaptation of their now-familiar \"The Whistling Man\" from their live shows invokes an Ennio Morricone-esque sound and style that calls to mind the final showdown of an old spaghetti western film. This opening serves the song well, complimented by the lyrics at the end describing the two protagonists as \"survivors\" in search of memories. Finally, \"Drones\" seems to put many people off in its pre-classical religious style, but being a fan of this kind of music, I found it enthralling. Even if I wasn't a fan of this style, Muse has a long history of using political and religious imagery to further their musical themes, so a hymn about Drones and destruction seems utterly fitting for this band.  Finally, I want to address the thematic quality of this album. Most of Muse's work contains some form of socio-political commentary. This album is no different, but its theme of emotional detachment and blind obedience in the frame of personal relationships is perhaps more boldly stated than any other theme Muse has ever had. Not one mixtape deviates from the concept of the album. While some fans believe that Muse has always produced light concept albums (in particular, \"2nd Law\"), I believe this is truly their first success. I personally enjoy the theme of this album. I always find their quasi-political commentary to be entertaining, the way it worked so well for bands like Marilyn Manson and Black Sabbath. However, just like Manson's \"Mechanical Animals\" and \"Holywood,\" \"Drones\" is a pure success in creating an album-long concept with boldly articulated statements. For some fans, this album lacks subtlety, particularly in its occasional use of dialogue tracks. But keep in mind, folks, that Muse has never been great on subtlety. The themes of such songs as \"Stockholm Syndrome\" and \"United States...\" are impossible to misinterpret. Perhaps some fans won't enjoy the stretching of this approach across an entire album but I enjoyed it immensely. Muse, for all their artistry, are not ready to rise to the artistic levels of progressive\/thematic bands like Pink Floyd or David Bowie and won't until they learn to uncouple their commentary from metaphorical discussions of romance. Sure, it works great on a pop level, but drowning your lyrics in micro-cosmic metaphor is what keeps a band from realizing the true potential of a concept album. I hope they manage that someday, but in the meantime, I will continue to enjoy the heck out of this album.  Overall, this album might not appeal to everyone and it might not entirely appeal to anyone, but it makes me very happy and has made me think a great deal about the construction of a concept album and the progression of this band. That much thought provocation deserves massive accolades, in my opinion. Not many albums can achieve this level of inspiration. So please, give it an open-minded chance. It might surprise you.","2563":"There are many conflicting opinions about this, Muse's latest album.

This album is no different, but its theme of emotional detachment and blind obedience in the frame of personal relationships is perhaps more boldly stated than any other theme Muse has ever had. Not one track deviates from the concept of the album. While some fans believe that Muse has always produced light concept albums (in particular, \"2nd Law\"), I believe this is truly their first success. I personally enjoy the theme of this album. I always find their quasi-political commentary to be entertaining, the way it worked so well for bands like Marilyn Manson and Black Sabbath. However, just like Manson's \"Mechanical Animals\" and \"Holywood,\" \"Drones\" is a pure success in creating an album-long concept with boldly articulated statements. For some fans, this album lacks subtlety, particularly in its occasional use of dialogue tracks. But keep in mind, folks, that Muse has never been great on subtlety. The themes of such songs as \"Stockholm Syndrome\" and \"United States...\" are impossible to misinterpret. Perhaps some fans won't enjoy the stretching of this approach across an entire album but I enjoyed it immensely. Muse, for all their artistry, are not ready to rise to the artistic levels of progressive\/thematic bands like Pink Floyd or David Bowie and won't until they learn to uncouple their commentary from metaphorical discussions of romance. Sure, it works great on a pop level, but drowning your lyrics in micro-cosmic metaphor is what keeps a band from realizing the true potential of a concept album. I hope they manage that someday, but in the meantime, I will continue to enjoy the heck out of this album.  Overall, this album might not appeal to everyone and it might not entirely appeal to anyone, but it makes me very happy and has made me think a great deal about the construction of a concept album and the progression of this band. That much thought provocation deserves massive accolades, in my opinion. Not many albums can achieve this level of inspiration. So please, give it an open-minded chance. It might surprise you.","2566":"There are many conflicting opinions about this, Muse's latest album. I have found sifting through them confusing, as I wondered why so many fans had so many varying opinions on this album. So, after listening to this album about a dozen times (at least half of that in the last two days), I believe I have discovered the reason: this is probably Muse's most complex album to date. The reason is that, while remaining true to the style of their more popular albums, this album manages to delve deeper into its theme while taking us on a roller-coaster ride of sound that ultimately demonstrates their range as a contemporary progressive rock band. The result is a musically varied but strikingly bold concept album that I believe some fans will probably not be able to understand in its entirety. Of course, by \"understand,\" I do not mean they cannot comprehend the message of the album (that is stated plainly enough), but rather it may cause some to question their own feelings in terms of how a standard progressive rock album should flow and whether or not Muse truly follows this path. Certainly, for me, this album has invoked many emotional responses ranging from shock and initial rejection, to elation at hearing Muse the way I prefer to hear them.  First, in comparing this work to Muse's previous albums, I found it to be more akin to their style as represented in \"Origin of Symmetry\" through \"Black Holes and Revelations\". This is a departure from the more experimental styles represented in \"Uprising\" and \"2nd Law\". In particular, the failings of these latter albums is in the coherence of the entire album. The first half of Uprising is brilliant, giving us such diverse and beautiful songs as \"Uprising\" and \"United States of Eurasia\" (arguably the strongest track on the album, and their most ambitious song to date). Unfortunately, the album falls apart about half-way through and, for me, is unable to maintain my interest. \"2nd Law\" was an interesting experiment in sound and style but ultimately leaves the listener wondering where their favorite band went. This intentionally pop-sounding album gave us at least one truly memorable tune in \"Madness\" but the rest is unfulfilling. \"Drones,\" on the other hand, is a solid, entirely consistent album. Not only does the theme of the album resonate in each track but the band's musical style never deviates (until the out-of-the-blue hymn-style final track). So while fans may not vibe with every single track, it is hard to argue that the band is off the rails here. While my interest slightly waned during tracks 5-8 on my initial listens, I found them satisfying upon repeated listens. I have seen several people complain that the dialogue tracks are superfluous, but I while I find \"Drill Sergeant\" a bit redundant when juxtaposed to \"Psycho\" I find these tracks functional, almost as a quick expositional monologue in a film gets the plot rolling. Ultimately, I found them to be akin to the bits of dialogue scattered throughout Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\" as a way of illustrating the points being made in accompanying songs.  The album starts out strong with \"Dead Inside\" which may be my favorite Muse song since \"Knights of Cydonia.\" It has a solid beat and the change-ups keep the song from getting stale. The lyrics are excellent, giving us the overture to the album as well as a great song about emotionally abusive relationships. The song only gets stronger as it progresses, which was what made \"Madness\" so catchy. It builds up in intensity as the lyrics become angrier and the protagonist increasingly self-critical. Next, both \"Psycho\" and \"Mercy\" elaborate, in their own ways, the gamut this album will run in terms of heaviness and melody. I find myself looking forward to these first three songs more than any others, simply because they are each so unique while still functioning side-by-side.  The next few songs are probably the kind that appeal to some people and not others. They are good, but not nearly as memorable as the latter three. They serve to drive the \"plot\" of the album through its second act as the character develops a critical, rebellious attitude. Noteworthy here is the unique beat in \"Revolt,\" which changes in interesting ways and keeps listeners on their toes. I was initially unimpressed by these songs, even jolted by how hard and abrasive they can be, but after focusing on the lyrics and couching them in terms of the album's concept, I found them satisfying, if still not my favorite songs on the album.  I've seen several complaints about the final tracks on this album. To my mind, they are some of the strongest work Muse has done in a while. Not only are they functional for creating a dynamic and dramatic final act to the album, but they incorporate many of the musical elements that have proven so popular among Muse fans. To begin, \"Aftermath\" is as beautiful a cd as I've heard from them since \"Blackout\" and will no doubt serve them well in live performances. It's rich and sing-along-inspiring chorus is a welcome respite from the dark and harsh previous tracks. Next, \"The Globalist\" is an extensive (it is long) attempt to show the self-destructive ends wrought by someone who alienates others through emotional back-lash and manipulation. In particular, an adaptation of their now-familiar \"The Whistling Man\" from their live shows invokes an Ennio Morricone-esque sound and style that calls to mind the final showdown of an old spaghetti western film. This opening serves the song well, complimented by the lyrics at the end describing the two protagonists as \"survivors\" in search of memories. Finally, \"Drones\" seems to put many people off in its pre-classical religious style, but being a fan of this kind of music, I found it enthralling. Even if I wasn't a fan of this style, Muse has a long history of using political and religious imagery to further their musical themes, so a hymn about Drones and destruction seems utterly fitting for this band.  Finally, I want to address the thematic quality of this album. Most of Muse's work contains some form of socio-political commentary.

It's evident that the file they have is just plain corrupt. I've requested a refund, but have heard nothing back. Don't acquire this CD!\n\nUPDATE: Amazon refunded my purchase price for this item soon after I had written this criticism.","2686":"\"Rainbow\" was a hard album for me to criticism. I adore Johnny Cash, and to give any one thing that he has done less than 4 stars is tough for me. \"Rainbow\" was released in 1985 and was Cash's last album for Columbia. Veteran Memphis producer Chips Moman was given the honors this time around. Chips Moman had produced some unreal R&B hits, as well as bringing Willie Nelson to the masses with \"Always on my Mind.\" Nontheless, this pairing doesn't work as well.  The material is weak and some quite ill-suited for Cash. \"Accessible Street\" sounds contrived as Johnny Cash tries to relate to being a millionaire who's having a crummy day. PLEEEEZ. On \"Adore Me Like You Used To\" Cash sounds as bored singing it as I did listening to it. Bitter. The album has three real good moments though. The opener \"I'm Leaving Now\" is a great lead track that Cash wrote about \"The System\" not a woman. Slice two is Kris Kristofferson's \"Here Comes That Rainbow Again\" which is an uplifting story told well. Cash's cover of CCR's \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain\" stands out also. This was the last digital download I needed to entire my collection. Now you know why.","2687":"I thoroughly enjoyed the Battlefield rendition of the series' many games' different themes. Battlefield 2 and Crummy Company being the most prominent, the sequences are very well integrated and recording quality is astonishing.\n\nThe reason for 4 stars rather of 5 is the very long, and very odd section of percussion only, about halfway through the song. It goes on for about 2 minutes and for a while I didn't understand what they were arduous to do. I then figured that it was probably their attempt at the Battlefield 3 and 4 theme. But no, it's not. The album came out even before Crummy Company 2 did... It doesn't ruin the overall experience entirely, but it was something that bothered me that I pondered was worth noting. Otherwise, it's a great piece!","2688":"The story itself is great. I have heard it before. But I am extremely disconcerted with Amazon's \"download\" service. I pondered I would end lp with an FLAC download that I could put on CD and listen to in the card. But rather I get a sort of referral to a website where I can hear the show but I cannot conserve it to my laptop and put it on CD. I specifically downloaded this show to listen to on a trip I will be taking in the car. I will definitely not be buying any more \"downloads\" from Amazon.","2689":"If you adore Jo Dee Messina- acquire this cd.  Simply for the fact that it's new music from her and she is a First-rate singer and artist.  As a stand alone cd, it's not crummy.  Probably the weakest of the \"Unmistakable\" trilogy in my opinion, but still with some good points.  \"Heaven was Needing a Hero\" and \"Get up Again\" are both great songs, with \"Get Up Again\" a throwback to an \"I'm Alright\" life is good anthem song. \"I like Me\" has promise but it's a bit all over the place.  \"How do you get High\" isn't as scandalous as it sounds, in fact, it really doesn't say any one thing as a song.  People get their fixes from different places.  Okay.  So..... \"Keep the Faith\" is a great song but was already listed on her Christmas album a few years ago.  \"That's God\" is well-written but not a radio hit.  As a whole, not a crummy cd, but nothing you want to sing out loud and jam to in the car.  But new music from Jo Dee Messina after waiting for four years is truly priceless....","2690":"I acquired this digital download (I would rather have a physical CD!) because I adore some of Joe Hisaishi's music from watching a few of Miyazaki's cartoons.  I am not an anime fanatic, nor do I fall in adore with every Joe Hisaishi tune.  I find that with Joe's music, I either fall helplessly in adore with it, or I just plain find it mundane as hell.  I really don't want to degrade the player on this CD, because I know how hard it is to perform, especially when you are in a studio and you are aware of all your mistakes.  This player is good, plays all the right notes.  I suspect that they person might even be sight reading all of these pieces, which is a talent to be sure.  Regrettably the playing comes off sounding very mechanical at times. Either way, there are some real gems on this album.  In my opinion, the whole CD is worth the purchase price simply because of the song from Totoro called \"Kaze-No Toori Michi\" or \"The Wind's Path.\"  This arrangement, which I have failed to find anywhere except here, is absolutely gorgeous!!  Whoever arranged this is simply brilliant!  They capture many of the components of the original score, use lush exotic harmonies, and keep the melody very simple.  The introductory repetitive left hand passage keeps the piece moving giving it an undercurrent of longing, sadness, or perchance just expressing the unbiased non-emotional qualities of nature and the wind?  I don't know, but it reminds me of what a progressive rock keyboardist might do with it like Keith Emerson, or Eddie Jobson.  The main theme from Totoro is cute, but I presume it would sound even finer taken up a few steps.  It's played without the happy qualities that it should be played with, and again, very mechanical.  Regardless, I did give it 5 stars because it has many redeeming qualities.","2691":"I acquired ZERO because I loved the Taller Children album and the FLAC download was only $5.\nSampled the songs and wasn't impressed but I pondered that after I listened a little more it would grow on me. Nope.\nBasically the album is mundane\/monotonous. Her voice is still fine but stays within a narrow range. The music is also uninspired.\nI miss the playfulness of Taller Children, the chills that Right Next To You created.","2692":"Ira and the crowd - what more need I say?","2693":"WOW I ADORE Lee's song \"Sweet Serendipity\"...astonishing, alluring, awe-inspiring! I can not stop listening to this song, my face is smiling and my feet and heart are dancing!!!  Yes I was surprised when I first heard this song because its so different from his preceding CD's and songs from American Idol (Lee is my ALL time cherished Idol).  WOW I adore and adore this \"New\" Lee...I can not wait for his new Album \"Live It Up\"...if this song is any indication to what is on his album I know it will be a great success. I am looking forward to following Lee's career and new music for many years to come.  Congratulations Lee you are such an astonishing and talented performer and person...you hit it big! You deserve it and should be extremely proud...Enjoy!","2694":"I was watching a tv series on DVD that I thoroughly enjoy (Life) and the background music for one of the episodes began to haunt me.  I caught part of a phrase in the song that went, \"breathe through it all, don't forget to smile when you fall.\"\nAnd searching for that phrase led me, without further ado, to the album, \"Game Called Life\" by Leftover Cuties.  Then it was a snap to find the album for sale in digital form at Amazon.com and acquired and downloaded it.  It's their own brand of jazz and I adore it.  Makes me imagine the prohibition days and the charleston days.  And a cover of a Lady Gaga song!  With Leftover Cuties I've been enchanted and captivated by a female vocalist that breathed new life into songs like You Are My Sunshine and the very talented musicians that together form this unreal band.  Give it a preview, odds are you'll adore it!","2695":"This is not the actual soundtrack. The audio quality is very meager and each track is only small portions of each song. I was the most disconcerted with Track 11 (From This Moment On), the main reason I wanted to purchase this album. The carefully\/deviously slice the instrumental portions of the song where there is not singing...only dancing in the film...which is some of the greatest music of the entire song. All that to say, an originally 6 minute song turned into a 2:36 song. Such a gargantuan failure.","2696":"I'm disconcerted with my purchase because I was looking to acquire the original song by the Carpenters,  but Amazon blocks music to non unlimited music members. What a bummer!","2697":"I adore this song from the movie, but after I got it, it stops playing before the music is finished.  I'm not very happy about that.

Fathom it was my fault and meager eyesite.","2699":"NOT the Carpenters... not even close to being the Carpenters.","2700":"I adore Bing's voice - in the age of crooners, he was the man.  This song takes me back (I'm not from that generation, but my imagination comes alive).  The lyrics are great as well; nice way to explain storms to a child.  Recommend for any Bing fan and to parents.","2701":"Where do I begin?\nFirst off, I really, really, really wanted to like this album. After reading the stories and criticisms I figured this was right up my alley. As a lover of all things pop and bubblegum, I pondered this would be on an equal plane of the best Ohio Express, 1910 Fruitgum Co, Association, Archies, Patridge Family all rolled into one.\nAlas, it is not to be.\nThere is nothing memorable here, nothing that will leave you humming the rest of the day. No hit singles to speak of. I've heard this was one of the most expensive albums made at the time. I think they struggled and struggled and tinkered over and over to splendid the sound and come up with a hit to no avail. The sound is fine, I have it on 180 gram vinyl. It's just the songs. They just sit there, with all their little background noises.\nThe only song I actually like is I'm With You. It sounds like the aforementioned Association crossed with The Partridge Family.\nI've struggled playing it over and over but nothing sticks. Not the song titles and not the cold, sterile tunes themselves.\nIt sounds bright and sunny but is hollow and empty beneath.","2702":"I have just transcribed the original UK vinyl(which I have treasured all these years) to FLAC and I'm shocked to find Amazon selling such a travesty as a download. The pitch is noticeably lower and the tracks all run longer. \"Adore Letters in the Sand\", for example, runs to 2'12\", not the 2'25\" Amazon claims. \"April Adore\" lasts 2'39\", not 2'54\" - yes, that's how big the difference is. As the last reviewers says, if you're buying the CD, make sure it sounds finer than these downloads. (My LP, by the way, includes all 14 tracks; I don't presume \"Capistrano\" and \"Louella\" were bonuses.)","2703":"This CD is a British London Records version of the original mono \"Pat's Great Hits\" with 2 bonus tracks added - \"When The Swallows Come Back to Capistrano\" and \"Louella\". I used to have that LP, and the speed was quite correct. Nontheless, at least the Flac samples here at Amazon are awfully slow. So, before buying the CD, make sure it sounds at normal speed.  You can also look for the \"Greatest Hits\" CD which contains 8 original mono tracks from \"Pat's Great Hits\" plus other great songs. As for myself, I made a CDR compilation of all Pat Boone main original Dot Records albums from 2 box sets of the Bear Family \"Pat Boone, The 50's Entire\" and \"The Sixties, 1960-1962\".","2704":"Adore the belief of this cd. But it's hard to understand the singers... Even after reading the lyrics I had a hard time picking out the names of the presidents and their wives in the songs...

Nontheless, the 18-track CD rather offers the 11 sides from his 1967 LP \"Alluring People\" (Vegas VS-401) together with 7 bonus track from his Vegas\/White Whale output. The good news for hits collectors is that you will get all four sides of his two Pop entries - Alluring People - # 38 Hot 100 in November\/December 1967 on Vegas 718 b\/w Flower Girl, and Springfield Plane - # 94 Hot 100 in February 1968 on Vegas 722 b\/w I'm Gonna Take It.\n\nSo, it looks like we're going to have to wait longer for a CD containing these 6 Country hits: You Bet Your Sweet, Sweet Adore - # 58 March 1974 - Capricorn 0038 b\/w Let's Go Find Some Country Music; Soulful Woman - # 18 Jan\/Feb 1975 - Capricorn 0219 b\/w Let's Get On The Road; My Honky Tonk Ways - # 37 Country and # 105 Hot 100 Bubble Under June 1975 - Capricorn 0233 b\/w Behind Closed Doors; Let's Shake Hands And Come Out Lovin' - # 9 July\/Aug 1978 - Capricorn 0301 b\/w We Might Be All Nite; As Long As I Can Wake Up In Your Arms - # 12 Dec 1978 - Capricorn 0309 b\/w Soulful Woman (re-issue); and Medicine Woman - # 32 April 1979 - Capricorn 0317 b\/w Who Do I Know In Denver?\n\nSome of the foregoing appeared in this 1974 LP \"Kenny O'Dell (Capricorn CP-0140) which contains: A1. Soulful Woman; A2. Everything I Am; A3. I'll Find Another Way (To Say I Adore You); A4. Lord, Am I Dreamin'?; A5. Let's Get On The Road; A6. Accessible Street; B1. Behind Closed Doors; B2. House Of Adore; B3. Let's Go Find Some Country Music; B4. I Take It On Home; B5. You Bet Your Sweet, Sweet Adore, and in his 1978 album \"Let's Shake Hands And Come Out Lovin'\" (Capricorn CPN-0211) which offers: A1. Let's Shake Hands And Come Out Lovin'; A2. We Can Make Music; A3. When It's Just You And Me; A4. Soulful Woman; A5. Behind Closed Doors; B1. Who Do I Know In Denver?; B2. As Long As I Can Wake Up In Your Arms; B3. We Might Be All Night; B4. Thank You Everlovin'; B5. I Take It On Home.\n\nAll we need is for some distributor to pull the different sides in these two LPs together with a bonus track to include My Honky Tonk Ways. That's the very least they could do to honour the writer inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame for writing such gems as Behind Closed Doors, a mega-hit for Charlie Rich, The Judd's Mama He's Crazy, and Loretta Lynn's Trouble in Paradise, just to name a few.","2707":"\"Speak Now\" is a fine Taylor Swift song that our granddaughter, age 8, memorized after hearing it one time, as she does any song that she likes. This is a fine song with a lot of meaning that she can relate to as we try to teach her that later in life she will have to bring her future husband to her grandfather to get his approval before she can marry him and he must be a fine suitor for such a fine granddaughter. Your cash will be well spent as it is a fine song as well as it is a good conversation piece for girls, daughters, and granddaughters and does not have any crummy language in it. Our granddaughter adores to imitate \"American Idol\" and we are the judges and she does this 100 percent and is off to Hollywood as we speak!","2708":"Liz Longley is a Pennsylvania native who studied voice at Berklee College of Music in Boston.  She has a great voice, expressive and conveying strong emotion.  \"High Loose Wire\" is her sophomore set.  \"Avery\" packs a forceful song with its story-song lyric about a thoughtless lover and the girl who still kind of adores him, \"You got so damn high, you left me in Wisconsin.  I was sound asleep as you drove my car away.  About a hundred miles south of where we were going, I was stuck in a stale motel just cursing your name.\"  \"Goodbye Adore\" slows the pace with Liz's vocals conveying hurt as a result of romantic betrayal, \"There's a place our adore remains, it's captured in time; It's still sitting by the river, your hands woven into mine.\"  This is a really alluring song.  Longley also includes two covers.  Van Morrison's \"Moondance\" and Joni Mitchell's \"River\" both are given exceptional treatments.  Liz Longley is an unreal talent, one you want to know well!  Enjoy!","2709":"The quality of the FLAC versions this album is VERY MEAGER.  It was \"ripped\" in VBR format to reduce the file size.  Amazon would lies about it, saying the record company demands they only offer low quality VBR rather than CBR.  (Variable Bit Rate vs. Constant Bit Rate)  VBR recorded MP3s are inherently lower quality even though if you complain to Amazon they will tell you that they are ripping the music that way to improve quality.  TOTAL BS!!!!!  IF you want to acquire this album in FLAC format, try a different vendor.  One positive note:  Amazon did refund my cash when I complained.","2710":"It's surprising how many magnum opus Christmas LPs have never been re-mastered for conversion to CD, none more so than Christmas Carols by Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra which first came out in 1958 as mono Dot 3148 containing: White Christmas; It Came Upon A Midnight Clear; O Holy Night; Deck The Halls; The First Noel; Joy To The World; Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful); Silent Night; God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen; O Tannenbaum (O Christmas Tree); Hark! The Herald Angels Sing; Faith Of Our Fathers; Jingle Bells; O Little Town Of Bethlehem.\n\nOver the years with subsequent reissues there were 3 different covers with the original having a mostly yellow cover and a stylized drawing of a sleigh inside a large red oval (which made it a bit odd in that Sleigh Ride itself was not among the tracks). In 1959 the same album came out in stereo (Dot 3148\/25148), with a glossy front cover, \"Billy Vaughn\" in white on a green background and gold-embossed \"Christmas Carols\" on red, with a gold embossed border. When re-issued again a few years later the cover was a flat red, the \"Dot\" logo in its usual 3 colors situated in a green circle, \"Billy Vaughn\" in white and \"Christmas Carols\" in yellow. Charting-wise it made it to # 145 on Billboard's Christmas charts in 1962 and # 101 in 1967.\n\nSome of the tracks have appeared on these CDs: Christmas With Billy Vaughn & His Yuletide Orchestra - 9 of the same tracks in a 10-track 2006 release that includes Auld Lang Syne; Christmas Classics, a 1996 release from Chicago Music Company that contains the same 10 sides; and Christmas Song, a 2012 release from Essential Media Group containing the same line-up. None of these include God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen or White Christmas, nor can I say with any certainty that they are all the same original 1958 renditions.\n\nWhy that has never been re-mastered for CD is a puzzle since Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra wasn't just some run-of-the-mill band back then. After being part of the supremely-successful Dot vocal quartet known as The Hilltoppers, who had 15 hit singles for the label from 1952 to 1954, he left to form the in-house Dot orchestra in 1954 that would go on to back the vast majority of Dot artists on so many hit singles and albums (e.g. Pat Boone, Gail Storm, The Fontane Sisters, Tab Hunter, Nick Todd (Pat Boone's brother), and many more for years to come.\n\nIn the midst of all that, he and his orchestra would rack up some 31 hit singles of their own from their first, Melody Of Adore in late 1954\/early 1955, to their last in 1967, I Adore You (And You Adore Me), while selling albums in the millions, 4 of which went Gold: The Golden Instrumentals (1956); Sail Along Silv'ry Moon (1958); Blue Hawaii (1959); and Theme From A Summer Place (1960).\n\nA great deal of his music is available on CD, so why are they dragging their heels with his premier Christmas album?","2711":"I've been sorting through boxes of old Christmas albums and commenting on most that are listed here at Amazon, lamenting the fact that many have never been re-mastered for conversion to CD, since these were the ones us old duffers recall most fondly.

Drums that stay simple but never let up. Skillful, reverberated vocals that melt steel(e). That certain air about an album that makes the discerned listener think \"80's!\" and throw up the horns instinctively....\nThese things were part of a style of metal that's now considered stale, untalented, retro, and any one thing else of the like to many people, shamefully many who are serious fans of metal. The style is straight up meat-and-potatoes heavy metal with no frills and no apologies. A forgotten flag proudly carried in the past by bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Accept, Queensryche, Saint, W.A.S.P., Stormwitch, Fifth Angel....and Sacred Warrior. Make no mistake, Sacred Warrior's debut, Rebellion, is not black metal, death metal, technical progressive algebra metal, beach metal, astral techno Jupiter moon metal, carpenter metal, symphonic metal, core-metal, coffee mug metal, or any one thing else except guitar heavy, scream filled, in your face American traditional\/power metal in the vein of the masters. In other words, this 1988 album serves as a great reminder of just why most metal fans got into metal in the first place. The songs here are simple, but extremely hooky, and always chock full of ultra great, over the top guitar playing and singing. There'll be no sheep heads flying off the stage, no deep nihilistic misanthropic whitebread message, no 'artful' avante garde snobbiness, no baloney at all to be found. What there will be is a lot of banging of head due to the solid songwriting to be found here and arduous to sing along with vocalist Rey Parra, a criminally overlooked belter in the style of Geoff Tate and Michael Kiske who can easily hold his own with the giants.\nAlthough there is a bit of variation in the overall quality of the songs on Rebellion, there are no real weak ones at all. There is a silly moment or two, such as in the opener, Black Metal - which doesn't seem to have a single thing to do with black metal at all, but does have a good line or two denouncing conformity within metal ('You try so hard to be like everyone else'). A weak melody here and there is also present, but Rey Parra's signature vibrato-drenched screams at the end close it off on a good note. Aside from the B-grade opener every single song is a winner, with some more obvious highlights in some places. Roughly half the album can be classified in the latter group, starting with the third song, Mad, Mad World. This song is simply an unbelievable piece of hard rock influenced, galloping heavy metal. The vocal layering in the chorus is enough to make the song astonishing on it's own, but there's also the shredding of guitarist Bruce Swift (easily one of the most underrated metal guitarists), the sledgehammer headbanging part after the second chorus, and some extra virtuosoic vocal work by Parra after the solo.. the man can almost be seen red-faced, singing so hard his vocal cords are sticking out of his throat. Even the lyrics (which speak out about the deceptive and superficial nature of society) are pretty great, which is a good thing. Not that the content itself of the album is crummy - there are a lot of uplifting messages of encouragement (Children of the Light, title track), warning (Master of Lies, Stay Away from Evil), and glorification of Jesus Christ (every song). The band's lyric writing ability is simply somewhat pedestrian on this album, so while there is always at least one good line to be found, overall the lyrics are almost too simple and minimalistic. Thankfully, nontheless, they never get awkward or silly, except for a little bit in the aforementioned Black Metal, with the chorus sporting the line, 'Long hair, parted between the eyes\/Silk pants, wrapped tight round your thighs\/Each day goes by, you're living a dream'. Yes, there's no questioning that it was 1988...\nGoing back to the rest of the songs, not each song is the best of them, but every song has at least one great <i>defining<\/i> moment in it (usually the chorus) that really helps make the song, which is why Rebellion is such a solid album. Then, some songs are just top quality, such as Mad, Mad World, Stay Away From Evil, which is a shorter song but has some good riffwork and one of the more infectious choruses to be found, Famine, a mid paced song that harkens directly back to Number of the Beast\/Piece of Mind era Iron Maiden and features Rey Parra doing his very best Geoff Tate impersonation, and The Heavens are Calling, another galloper with some fiery solos and more catchy vocal work. The interesting thing about the chorus vocals on this album - like on The Heavens are Calling - is that many times rather of singing different verses with a set melody, there will be only one or two actual lines in the chorus, but introduced by 'general' vocalizations, like a 'Whooaaa, ohh ohhh', which helps give Rebellion a refreshing flair. There is also Children of the Light and Master of Lies, both distinguished speed metal songs with big chorus hooks carried by Parra's gargantuan vocal range and Bruce Swift laying down riff after riff and solo after solo. On a small negative note, the drums sound a bit odd on the faster songs - that's not to say that Tony Velazquez does a crummy job behind the drumkit, but the drums just seem to be more engineered for the more midpaced, anthemic songs, and so when there's double bass pounding, the drum triggers stick out like a sore thumb. Of course, it could just be chalked up as part of the album's charm depending on your opinion.\nThe rest of the songs could be considered average, but not filler, which is important when an album has only 11 songs or under. Regardless, there's still something incredibly cool about each one, like the big riff\/solo set in the closer, Sword of Victory.\nRebellion is the kind of album everybody who enjoys metal should have at least a few of. There's nothing exactly like being refreshed with straight up well played heavy metal and that's what Sacred Warrior plays best.","2715":"I might give a finer criticism if I can ever find out how to actually listen to it.","2716":"reminds me of the great Conferring With The Moon\/Imaginary Roads time period.\n\nThose two CD's are stone classics.\n\nThis one will grow with time.\n\nI've listened all the way through once.\n\nSuperb.","2717":"Sound quality is very crummy, I might say ghastly, this is not an FLAC record, it is an MP0, nada, ghastly.

Winterhalter Goes Latin-RED cover-Hallmark label)  DO NOT ACQUIRE THIS DOWNLOAD!!! It is an insult to the talent of Mr. Winterhalter and the RCA Living Stereo technology which produced & issued this fine music 50+ years ago.  This download is made from an old scratchY LP and sounds A W F U L!  It sounds like it is in monaural, depriving the listener of the full, wide-spectrum sound the RCA LIVING STEREO line was known for.  DO NOT ACQUIRE THIS!!!\n\nOn the other side of the coin is that there are other Hugo Winterhalter  Flac collections containing the same songs currently available through Amazon. I will be investigating those other versions of this GREAT music and will post my findings here. PLEASE DO NOT ACQUIRE THIS EDITION....YOU WON'T BE HAPPY.\n\nP.S. There are many criticisms @ Amazon regarding these downloads. Regrettably, it's impossible to know which criticisms refer to which edition of this music. The \"DO NOT ACQUIRE\" version I'm speaking about was made available in 2009. There is a new issue from 2015 showing Mr. Winterhalter's face on a green background. Hopefully it's improved. That's my next attempt to get a clean copy of this music. I'll keep you informed, but............\n--------------------------------------DON'T ACQUIRE THE ONE WITH THE RED COVER---------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE AS OF JULY 12, 2016.\n\nI promised to get back to criticism ANOTHER FLAC of the same songs by Hugo Winterhalter, this time the one with the GREEN COVER and Hugo's face on that cover. Although these ARE NOT THE SAME RECORDINGS AS ON THE ORIGINAL LP WITH THE RED COVER, they are a gargantuan improvement over the FLAC reviewed above. These recordings are in true stereo, have been \"cleaned up\", and sound good! Also, this download is a buck cheaper that the HARROWING ONE WITH THE RED COVER. If you want good versions of these terrific latin tunes, go for this one, you will not be disconcerted, even though the recordings are NOT the same versions on the original RCA Hugo Winterhalter Goes Latin, which I encourage you to avoid on FLAC.","2720":"Got this CD set as an x-mas gift for our 2 yr old who adores Disney. The songs are crummy renditions of actual Disney songs. The recording quality is abhorrent.

What a misuse of $$$$. Between the vocal mistakes, amateur vocals, and lazy recording techniques this CD falls short of a professional, acceptable CD set. Shame on this Orchestra for having such low standards and shame on Hallmark records for releasing this.","2721":"Iconic cover is about the best thing about this album. San Quentin is great, but the prisoners call for an encore and Johnny obliges, but why put it on the album? Has this ever transpired before or since? I kept thinking 'perchance a riot will break out or someone will get shivved mid-song' but no, it is virtually the same. If I were locked up in San Quentin for twenty to life then I would happily sit through it forty times, but on my record player if and when I want an encore I can just lift the tonearm back a quarter inch. The version of Folsom Prison Blues is basically just Johnny thanking everyone then he sings the chorus once then leaves the stage. Ripped off - one of my favourites. Rather of San Quentin twice, Folsom once would have been great.\n\nFine rereading that now, \"extremely depressing\" is too harsh, the versions of \"Walk the Line\" and \"Boy Named Sue\" and \"San Quentin\" Version No. 1 are must haves. \"Bothersome\" is more accurate.","2722":"This FLAC download is of the original 1958 RCA VICTOR LP.\n\n.\nAs far back as 1953, RCA VICTOR experimented with two track recordings. Starting in '55, this company issued a series of stereo reel tapes and when Westrex developed a practical system for stereo LPs a couple of years later, RCA got into this format in a big way. In 1958, their first full year of LIVING STEREO album production, they issued about 200 titles. BOB AND RAY THROW A STEREO SPECTACULAR (LSP-1773) is one of these pioneering records.\n\nIt's really a chance for the label to demo this new process and offer samples of their growing stereo catalog. Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding's bits sprinkled throughout the program are excuses for various sound effects. On these segments, cross-channel panning is used to simulate movement across the sound stage. Stereo was a novelty that year, so the wider the spacial effect, the bigger the \"wow!\" factor.\n\nRANDOM NOTES\nOn \"B & R at the Castle\" we meet hunchbacked 'Gore' (Bob as Karloff) and 'Dr. Akhbar' (Bob doing Peter Lorre). He's Director of Bob and Ray Scientific Research and we're first shown Dr. A.'s experimental fly, 'Neil.'\n\nThe \"Minuet on the Rocks\" excerpt is boogiefied Paderewski, with Skitch pounding away at a honky tonk piano. Behind the creaky door of \"The Round Room  is a bagpipe marching band. Besides many unusual percussion instruments in the Schory's \"Buck Dance,\" we also hear tap shoes. Lena's \"New-Fangled Tango\" is a mono 'live' at the Waldorf performance that has the audience giggling. Within the ballroom on \"The Thing\" is a clock with a screaming human pendulum. \"Second Hungarian Rhapsody\" is an edited version of one of the most insane oompah band recordings ever made.\n\nRichard Leibert was Radio City's first-ever organist. His high output holiday song at the keys really gives your speakers a workout. If \"Song of the Volga Boatmen\" sounds like Glenn Miller, there's a good reason. Several Miller alumni play on this recreation of the original Bill Finegan arrangement. The experiments in Dr. A.'s \"Laboratory\" are samples from RCA's sound effects library.\n\nXavier's Cugat's fourth wife, Abbe Lane (\"Whatever Lola Wants\") is a Jewish girl from Brooklyn, born Abigail Lassman in 1932. \"The Ox Drivers\" reflects a popular trend of that day, folk music. Album-closing \"The End\" has shrunk-in-size Bob and Ray as the mad doctor's final experiment.\n\nPROGRAM\n\n[4:25] Bob and Ray Visit Dr. Ahkbar at the Castle\n[2:41] Riders in the Sky - George Melanchrino & his orch.\n[1:10] Minuet on the Rocks - Skitch Henderson & his orch.\n[2:23] Bob and Ray in the Round Room\n[2:29] Buck Dance - Dck Schory's New Percussion Ensemble\n[3:04] New-Fangled Tango (from the Broadway musical \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Happy-Hunting\/dp\/B00128VZKS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Happy Hunting<\/a>\") - Lena Horne\n[1:18] The Thing - Bob and Ray\n[2:07] Second Hungarian Rhapsody - Guckenheimer Sour Kraut Band\n[2:09] The First Nol - Dck Lebert at the Radio City Music Hall Organ\n[2:49] We'll Gather Lilacs in the Spring (from the London musical \"Perchance to Dream\") - Julie Andrews\n[3:28] Song of the Volga Boatman - Sauter-Finegan Orchestra\n[2:20] Bob and Ray in the Laboratory (Rifles; Surf; Cat Fight)\n[2:29] Whatever Lola Wants (from the Broadway musical \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Damn-Yankees\/dp\/B009RWUP4S\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Damn Yankees<\/a>\") - Abbe Lane w\/Tito Puente & his orch.\n[2:30] The Ox Drivers - The Belafonte Singers\n[2:10] The End - Bob and Ray\n\nTOTAL TIME: 37:32","2723":"This album, Pickwick SPC 3274 from early-mid 1971 or so, is a gem of early Glen Campbell Capitol 45 singles' stiffs that pre-date his GENTLE ON MY MIND period.

One I could recommend, of somewhat oblique Glen Campbell interest, is LOU RAWLS, COME ON IN MISTER BLUES, Pickwick SPC 3156, which is a comp of Lou Rawls pre-Lp Capitol 1962-ish 45 recordings, and in stereo, Merle Travis's \"Nine Pound Hammer\" with Glen Campbell in the session lineup.\n\nDating PC\/SPC Pickwick Lps:\n\n3\/6\/65:  3001-3012\n5\/29\/65:  3022-3024\n10\/02\/65:  3028-3040\n8\/27\/66:  3048-3054\n9\/28\/68:  3116-3133\n1\/31\/71:  3252 (JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR \"excerpts\" $1.89 album)\n7\/31\/71:  3273-3279\n10\/30\/71:  3288-3290\n7\/29\/72:  3307-3326\n8\/11\/73:  3344-3353\n8\/3\/74:  3381-3398\n\nPrior to mid-'68, Pickwick Lps were $1.98 mono list, $2.49 stereo.

This product is not available (yet) in CD so I was pleased to find it available as an FLAC download here to play for my grandson. After I downloaded the songs I was very dismayed to find the music plays at a much slower speed and lower octave than the original vinyl. This obviously transpired when the person or company who transferred the vinyl to digital used a slow playing turntable. Bob Keeshan's voice sounds like a low baritone in this download and the songs drag rather than zip along. I reported this to Amazon the next day and they refunded my cash promptly and said they would \"report it\". This should be accessible to fix and hopefully a treasured album will be \"splendid\" again, but until then avoid it!","2725":"I acquired this album because brahms no. 4 is one of my cherished, and so is bso. The amazon page lacks any description of conductor, time of performance etc. After downloading it i found the sound quality rather crummy. From the other criticism I learned it's conducted by Charles Munch, and the time of performance must be 50 yrs ago. So this album must have been remastered from LP. I would rather acquire an album more recent but sounds finer. So be aware.","2726":"Over the years I have collected several dozen \"Oktoberfest\" albums. I am of German descent, and I adore the magnum opus beer hall music, and to my ears, this is the ONE album that really makes me feel that I an \"there\". Perchance because this is the album I \"grew up with\" as a battered LP, this is my all time cherished of the genra. I had converted to old LP to cassette format, the burnit to a CD, then converted it to an FLAC. You cannot imagine my delight when I found it available as a commercial FLAC dowload (minus all of the scratches, pops, and hiss). If you are looking for \"the one\" album of German beer drinking music, look no further - you have found it!","2727":"While Noel Coward is supremely entertaining, this recording was poorly done. There is a reason this album is less than $2 -- it sounds as if someone found an old vinyl record and set up the microphone to the speaker and recorded these MP3s from that. The recording is very scratchy just like on old vinyl LP. It also sounds like was recorded in mono. The high notes cause the headphones on my iPod to play static. The orchestra sounds flat, and there is no brilliance in Noel Coward's performance.\n\nThere is a reason that this has been put into two separate MP3s rather of individual tracks -- the first one is side A from the vinyl record and the second track is side B! Do not purchase this recording until it becomes remastered by the studio. I am supremely disconcerted by this.","2728":"It's a disgrace that Amazon as actually charging cash for this amateurish reclamation of an Lp.  It's poorly transferred: lots of residual clicks and other artifacts, and, lowest of all, it's been put through a limiter!  What a failure.\n\nShame on you, Amazon.\n\nF. Reeder","2729":"Fine, loved the record.  Acquired this FLAC album thinking I could get closer to the old Capitol master tapes.  Listened to a few samples; appeared reasonable, but the samples aren't full fidelity.  Downloaded the album, only then to discover it was dubbed from a well-worn LP.  I was quite disconcerted!  Now, it is GREAT music, and if you don't have it in any format, then its hard to go wrong at $6.99.  But, the album is still common enough in flea markets if you have a record player.  So I have it two stars; great music, depressing recording.","2730":"I gave this 5 stars, because it's such a great album...but, the first reviewer was correct... quality is tolerable and finer than not having it at all.\n\nTHIS IS THE BEST CHRISTMAS ALBUM YOU'LL EVER HEAR OR ADORE! As astonishing as it is...you deserve the best possible copy\/quality of this recording as you can get!!! For now, that appears to be on used vinyl. This download will do for now and is probably worth the cash to download, but, with any luck, someone will find the masters and make us fans, all happy! Nontheless, this download will conserve you the bother of doing the transfer from vinyl yourself until a finer quality download or edition on CD comes along!\n\nThe title slice, \"Christmas Is For The Family\" and \"I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day\" are cult Christmas classics that are revered by Christmas music fans and a mandatory addition to their collection after you've heard them the first time. I've never heard another rendition of either song done so perfectly. You'll adore these two and they will easily make it into your Christmas music rotation. Frankly, either or both should have been released as a singles but, the label (Design Records) was not a \"single\" oriented label. Their catalog pertains to popular artists singing songs that are lesser known than their hits or their early recordings after an artist made it big or accomplished singers\/musicians doing covers of big tunes. Needless to say, some of these LP's, like this one were destined to become classics. Had \"Christmas Is For The Family\" or \"I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day\" been released as singles the year this LP was released, either would have done very well and would now be staples of Christmas music rotation on radio airwaves both local free and satelite radio and more than likely given Bing Crosby's \"White Christmas\" a run for it's cash as the biggest selling Christmas records of all time. \"May Santa Fill Our Hearts\" is another slice on this LP that is another cult magnum opus, and I've never heard another cover of the song. There is some great original material on this LP as well as standards.\n\nOn \"Christmas Is For The Family\", side one is \"Popular\" Christmas Classics with stunning lush arrangements wrapped around Dennis Day's voice with full studio orchestra, featuring Lou Hollingsworth at the Wurlitzer Organ, and the Vail Boys Choir. Side two is more of a \"Traditional\" Christmas Classics that you might hear in Church, mostly done with Lou at the Organ and the boys choir again, in arrangements to stir emotions in even the coldest of souls at Christmas Time.\n\nJack Benny's appearance as \"Santa\" playing the violin on the cover, as well as Jack playing, speaking and singing at the begining and the end of side one and the beginning of side two and another little cameo at the end is a nice bit of nostalgia from when Dennis used to appear regularly on Jack's Television Show that I'm sure was designed to boost LP sales.\n\nNow, aside from that, this is the finest Christmas album you'll ever hear from a man with a voice that was a gift that was meant to sing Christmas Songs, Irish Folk Songs, as well as be shared with the masses.\n\nI am on my 3rd pressing of this Christmas Magnum opus and 4 years ago, I spent over a month, finding pristine copies of this LP to give as Christmas gifts to members of my family who have fond recollections of Christmas due to this fine recording.\n\nRegrettably, IT'S NOT available on CD, YET! I just wish someone could find the masters and have enough sense to re-release it so we can all enjoy this astonishing Christmas Magnum opus. Until such time, you'll have to do like I did...get one coverted to CD to get you by till the real thing comes along.","2731":"When it does come down to it, the cast of Glee has done some really pathetic covers. When I heard them recently do a cover of Whitney Houston's I Look To You, I really pondered that they just really killed the rawness and the intimate appeal of the song. They've done the same belief when they've mixed two rock classics together into one song, by mixing Bon Jovi's Livin' On A Prayer, and the magnum opus Rolling Stones anthem Start Me Up, it feels like the killjjoy of 2 die hard fans into one badly made opus. It feels like the songs from the Rock Of Ages musical feel like a finer novelty to listen to than what the cast of Glee has done with alluring songs. I also think the producers of Glee should try and deliver more original songs than the feeling of covers being more like gags with crescent rolls.\n\nSong: F-","2732":"Mantovani's All Time Christmas Beloved - 2 LP set:\n\nThis album is a repackaging of the two US LPs #1: Mantovani - Christmas Carols, London PS 142 (1958) AND #2: Christmas Greetings From Mantovani And His Orchestra, London PS 338 [Stereo] OR LL 3338 [Mono] (1963).

While I have about 50 Mantovani LP albums, most from my parent's collection and some acquired used, most do not have dates printed on them anywhere.  The current best source of album listings that I have found is at[...].  Wikipedia's Mantovani page lists 2 additional Christmas albums: Christmas Carols, London LL 913; and Merry Christmas to All of You, Decca 66445009 (1963).  I cannot find any other references to either of these albums anywhere.  There is an extensive LP (and even old 78s) listing on the mantovani-orchestra(dot)com site, but it does not include many US albums that I own and it appears that the catalog numbers there are non-US.\n================================================================","2733":"My parents acquired this album in 1967 from Goodyear for $1.00.  I was 6 years old then...I'm 52 now.  Not ONE Christmas has gone by since without listening to this Christmas magnum opus! Every song is finer than the last. God Bless these fine artists for giving us this gem for all of the many Christmases of the past, present and future!","2734":"The 1964 RCA VICTOR LP entitled Let's Ring the Bells ALL AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE (LPM\/LST-2914) is a souvenir of the New York World's Fair. It includes an album-sized four page booklet, \"Of Bells and Carillons,\" from which comes much of the trivia here.\n\nThe RCA and Coca-Cola pavilions were close neighbors at the Fair. Victor's John Klein was also musical director for Coke and the Carillonneur of their pavilion's centerpiece, what was then the world's largest carillon: a 120-foot tower housing 610 chimes capable of many different tones: Flemish bells, Harp, Lute, Aeolian, Baroque, Celestial and several others.\n\nThe original carillons were far simpler devices that required many ringers to operate a few roped bells that weighed tons. Modern carillons are electro-mechanical marvels controlled by keyboards, stops and pedals, their sounds created by miniature bronze bells weighing mere ounces rather of pounds or tons. The secret is a series of audio amplifiers and speakers. The Coca-Cola carillon had 57 directional speakers (stentors), some four-feet across, that projected 3,000 watts of amplified sound.\n\nPrincipal recordings for \"All Around the Christmas Tree\" of Henry Ren&eacute;'s orchestra and chorus were made at Webster Hall in NYC. Master tapes, equipment and engineers then relocated to Flushing Meadow, Queens and the Coke pavilion, where Mr. Klein added his bells on a separate tape track. The results are nothing less than remarkable, what sounds like a concert of perfectly blended orchestra, voices and carillon.\n\nOne of the most unique holiday albums ever, this one gets a highest recommendation!\n\nSIDE ONE\n[3:45] Silent Night; O Little Town of Bethlehem; We Wish You a Merry Christmas\n[2:59] All Around the Christmas Tree\n[2:45] Sleigh Ride\n[3:15] Joy to the World; Adeste Fideles; Hark!

It originally appeared in the 50s on a monaural LP (Capitol T-9013).  It is that edition which I found at Amazon (Sold by Looney Geeks).  Given the rarity of the recording, one must be prepared to accept pops and crackles, and there are a goodly sprinkling of those throughout both sides.  The sound, of course, is typical of the early days of high fidelity.  That said, the record is well worth owning if you can find a copy.  The carols are played with deep and heart-felt simplicity, with no fancy arranging.  The chimes are very well used to accentuate the simple directness of Biggs' interpretations of a goodly selection of the most beloved carols.  The only drawback with regard to the copy I received is that it was plainly advertised as an audio CD (which obviously it is not).  I had fully expected the item to be a remake by someone from the original vinyl, and am somewhat disconcerted that such was not the case.  By and large, though, the quality of the disc is quite acceptable although the price ($24.95) iwas a bit steep, given that the disc is not in pristine condition.  Nevertheless, if you can find one, ACQUIRE IT!","2736":"Although there is no information about this recording on Amazon, I presume it is the 1962 D'Oyly Carte version originally issued on vinyl as London OSA 1248. At the time it was the the best recording you could acquire. Nontheless, presumably due to the constraints imposed by 4 sides of vinyl, the Finale is missing four verses starting with \"Having been a wicked baronet a week.\" I really missed them at the time since they are among my cherished parts: who wouldn't like \"For to settle in the town of Basingstoke.\" I was hoping that this rerelease would include the missing material, but it does not.\n\nI have ripped my own vinyl and I was also hoping this would be a cleaner version, but its not. The sound quality is quite meager.\n\nI wish that someone would find the missing verses (they must have been recorded) and clean up the sound and re-rerelease this. That effort would likely produce the best Ruddigore available.","2737":"I was skeptical when I heard about this compilation of music because, as a gargantuan RUSH fan, I expected it to really fall short. Apparently DARKSTAR originally had a bunch of great, magnum opus RUSH songs as the soundtrack, and due to some crappy Hollywood greed tactics by Universal, the Producers dumped the belief and replaced the songs with their own, custom scored music. It is astonishing, and truly lives up to the expectations one would expect of a AAA touring act. The music ranges from eerie, ambient tracks to full out rockers.  Jimmy Pitts on keyboards is epic, his style more aligned to virtuosic guitar work like you'd expect from Vai, but the guitar neck laid out on a table for the talented Pitts to burn up with hand-played arpeggios and leads that seem impossible on keyboards. Likewise, Bill Bruce is phenomenal with his tasteful passages, grinding rhythms, and signature classical guitar riffs mixed with well written layered leads.  If you're a fan of Vai, Zappa, TSO, Rush, Yes, and all progressive, this is the record for you.","2738":"Fats Domino was as meaningful as any other artist (except perchance for Buddy Holly) in my early music appreciation days. I didn't have a lot of 45s in those years but there was more Fats than anyone. He remains a great cherished.\nTwo things led me to buying this single. One was that I never have owned it and as such had never heard the B side until I acquired an ACE Fabulous Flips compilation years back. I don't have nearly the 45s I used to but I do have a jukebox to feed. The other is that \"Before I Grow Too Old\" is not on the 4 disc Imperial box. A bitter oversight.\nI rank \"Before I Grow Too Old\" in my top 10 Fats Domino songs. If  you still play 45s, seek this single out. The A side is no slouch either. If not I recommend the ACE Fabulous Flips Vol. 3","2739":"My brother is going to flip when he opens this gift...We had a lot of these songs on tape that we used to listen to on record or in the car when we were little kids with my mom.  My mom just passed away this October.  This gift will mean so much to my brother!\nThank you!","2740":"I acquired this FLAC thinking that it was a song. But its not a song it's just him preaching","2741":"Adore Carroll Robertson!  Adore this song!  I was so upset the first Christmas I realized I couldn't listen to this any longer since I no longer had a cassette tape player to play it!  Alluring song, great lyrics! Gotta adore digital!  Go ahead, acquire it!  You know you want to!  You'll be glad you did!","2742":"I came across this by accident because I was hoping to find a live version from Kenny Wayne Shepherd because I've heard him do this song live twice & he does an unreal job. This version by Scott Finch is very decent, but seems a little uninspired. The guitar work is great, but just isn't quite there, and the singing is certainly missing in spots, nontheless, this is a very decent version and is well worth $ .99. I'd give this a 3.5 if I could, but it doesn't deserve a 3 because it is finer than that.","2743":"Don't let the name \"Foetus\" fool you--when I was first recommended Thirlwell's music, I though it was going to be some ghastly goth or metal nonsense.  How wrong I was.\n\nEveryone who knows me knows that I am almost pathologically obsessed with Thirlwell's musical output.  Despite his proclivity it seems like nobody knows who he is--and even when you find a Foetus fan (usually online) discussing his music they focus on some of his older stuff, like NAIL or HOLE.  The dilemma here is not that Thirlwell got worse over time--the dilemma is is that he attracted lot of fans of the overly broad designation of \"industrial music.\"  The result is that many of those that do know who he is cling to the era when his sound was closer to early \"industrial\" and noise music.\n\nIf there is any one thing Thirlwell is not, it is being an artist that has the same sound over his entire career.  In some ways it's hard to presume that the same genius that created NAIL also produced this First-rate orchestral brilliance.  In fact, the Thirlwell of the past--usually wearing some guise, most famously the  \"Clint Ruin\" persona--seems radically different from the Thirlwell we see today.  Compare the pictures of Thirlwell back then standing amid impaled hog heads to him in a suit conducting for a live performance of Manorexia.  Thirlwell has never been content to stay in the same place.\n\nEvery Thirlwell album, then, is a delightful new surprise, and I had waited for this album in near-agony, and the delays only compounded by impatience.  Remember how excited you used to get near Christmas back during your childhood?  That's how I felt waiting for this album to finally arrive into my mailbox, except in this case, Christmas was delayed at least twice due to Santa Claus to finally get his sleigh painted the right color before leaving the North Pole. (This metaphor makes sense only to those that followed the delays of this album).  A little voice inside me wondered how Thirlwell could top ADORE, and how I'd probably be disconcerted after all that waiting, because I'm just negative that way.  Foetus isn't often very uplifting to listen to, so I suppose I can be forgiven for my pessimism.  Fortunately, I was glad I was wrong--this may be Thirlwell's best album yet, and it's probably my cherished.  He took what made ADORE so good and made it even finer.\n\nHIDE is a concept album with held together by the themes of fear, paranoia, and uncertainty; lyrical references throughout are apocalyptic (particularly \"Oilfields\") and numerous references to fear-stirring events that were current during the album's production (e.g., \"anthrax in the envelope\"), and it seems that Thirlwell envisioned the album as being the sountrack to a movie that exists only within his own head--which is something you may expect from an artist that already outputs First-rate cinematically-inspired pieces (check out Manorexia!) and has expressed a desire to score for a big-budget movie. Cosmetics, for example, comes across as a bombastic, operatic opening while O Putrid Sun sounds like something that would play to rolling credits after a downer of an ending.  Throughout Thirlwell adeptly mixes \"haunting\" with \"alluring\" and does so over a large range of style.  I'll let other reviewers go more in-depth over the individual songs, they're finer at describing them than I am.\n\nAlso, I forgot to describe the cover art.  For a lack of proper adjectives I'll close this criticism by stating that it's \"pretty friggin' awe-inspiring,\" which you can see for yourself.","2744":"I have this distinguished LP and my copy is in good shape. Have transfered it into a CD and now I pondered I was buying a \"Digitally Remastered\" CD transfer, as it was announced at the site. Should have stayed with my non-remastered copy that is much, really much finer than this copy. I can' really presume this was remastered, otherwise the copied LP is in an harrowing shape and, again, should not have been used for commercial purposes. Avoid it and wait for a decent copy.","2745":"Another great EP from FOF.  The guys know how to deliver forceful alternative rock to magnum opus carols.\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n-Guitars operate on FOF's well known grand scale, creating great audio landscapes, especially on \"Do you hear what I hear?\"-------really feel like a shepherd out on that unreal night.\n-Instrumental track isn't a simply filler, but is really a great intro into the epic rendition of \"Pie Jesu\".  Works great.\n-Nice balance between symphonic guitars, acoustic, vocals and piano.  \"Angels We Have Heard on High\" has a kind of coffee house feel to it, and then \"The Earth Stood Still\" nearly deliver tears to your eyes.  Astonishing musical diversity between 6 tracks.\nDRAWBACKS:\n-4 stars only because it's an EP--------------I fathom if you combine it with the 1st \"Advent\", you kind of have a full-length Christmas album.  It's just short, and you're thirsting for more by the end of \"Pie Jesu\".\n\nOverall, great EP.  Splendid for listening in and out of the season.","2746":"the first 20 seconds of the version of this song has a very high pitched tick-tick-tick sound (not in a cool way) and is very bothersome.  I did not want to hear this version repeately.  The first time was enough. Regrettably the sample music of this version does not play the song from the very beginning, so I did not see this coming.  I basically need to throw out this version of the song off my playlist, misuse $1 and try to forget about the time wasted to download this song, etc.  Hope you guys purchase a different version and not run into the same mistake I did.","2747":"Prior to listening to this album I read a few criticisms. About half of the criticisms themselves were positive and half were negative. But the comments were 90% negative, made up of people ripping this band apart for any reason from a lack of originality to their cocky personalities off-stage to their cookie-cutter image. This band must have upset quite a few people in their quest for fame.\n\nThe EP itself starts off alright. The chanting at the beginning of the first track made me a little excited, but as soon as the lead singer came in, I was immediately turned off. His voice is extremely nasally. It's a good thing that the EP is only 14 minutes (not a single song over the 3 minute mark), because his voice is painful. The guitarwork, drumming, and keyboards are all great, and it's a shame that they have such a ghastly singer. I'd really like to adore this band since their name comes from one of my cherished childhood movies Three Ninjas, but I just CANNOT get over how bothersome his voice is.","2748":"I pondered this was the original versionnot as good. Accessible to understand the lyrics though which is nice for the kids when they are arduous to sing along.","2749":"This criticism features the song Night and Day, from the album:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Vintage-Music-No-136-LP-Jo-Stafford\/dp\/B004ASZXFU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Vintage Music No. 136 - LP: Jo Stafford<\/a>\n\nBesides being a great melody this one captures the essence of Eros I pondered.  I couldn't actually tell whether either of the versions of this song I've acquired is finer quality.

One of them, in the Christmas spirit and particularly lovely is the soothing&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Star-Of-Hope\/dp\/B004AST8DI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Star Of Hope<\/a>&nbsp;.  Best wishes for Christmas and the year to come.","2750":"I acquired this (and another of their Christmas albums) based on a couple YouTube videos.  The quality on the videos was much finer than the quality of the albums.  I was hoping these would become a family cherished, but they were generally considered so-so by the family.  Oh well!","2751":"An&uacute;na's first Christmas album, \"Christmas Songs,\" did not contain one track that failed to deliver the group's signature haunting choral arrangement of folk, ecclesiastical, traditional and classical\/ancient pieces.  Listening to these initial samples of this one, I can say with a fair amount of confidence if you own that first Christmas album, I am here to tell you that you are likely to be disconcerted with \"Christmas with An&uacute;na.\"\n\nThe only tracks on this disc that fully capture that haunting beauty that we have come to adore in and expect from An&uacute;na are \"Nol Nouvelet\" and \"Sanctus,\" and this latter has already long been available on their first album.\n\nNot that all the others are crummy.  \"Angelus ad Virginam\" is a little bit different from their original arrangement - a little bit more of a tribal Celtic folk beat to it, but still enjoyable and choral.  The child solist in \"Away in a Manger\" is sweet, but set against the old backing \"Oooo\"s of the piece it feels kind of like a cheap cop-out.  \"Ding Dong Merrily on High\" and \"Codail a Linbh\" seem promising, but the arrangements start to stray almost more into the nauseous nostalgia, rather than choral, category of Christmas music.\n\nThis perchance wouldn't be so noticable except that the other tracks stray progressively further in that direction, and \"Christmas Recollections,\" \"Christmas Kisses\" and \"Angels Are Singing\" are clearly vanity puff-pieces arranged in the manner of the dreaded Christmas nostalgia soloist album.  All of them are absolute disasters, and absolutely unexpected from An&uacute;na.\n\nHad they done away with these last three tracks and gotten rid of \"O Tannenbaum\" (an upbeat carol that does NOT work with choral arrangements no matter how much you wish it did), \"The First Nol\" (a sappy song that will ALWAYS sound like nostalgia music no matter how hard you try) and \"Away in a Manger\" (which, though not crummy here, suffers terribly in comparison to the arrangement on the first album) and struggled just a little bit harder to find good ecclesiastical motets or other traditional folk songs in other European languages (and there are plenty), that might have made up for the mediocrity of the other tracks.  Regrettably, the few really good tracks make the rest of the album VERY pale by comparison.","2752":"I adore Christina Aguilera and O Holy Night is my Cherished Christmas song so what could be finer than having my cherished song sung by such an awe-inspiring artist as her. She puts her own unique twist on it with her unique voice ..I adore it and have it on repeat.","2753":"This adulation of Horowitz has been making me nauseous all life.  He has never displayed any respect for composers intentions, plays everything the way he \"likes\" and always with a tight, hypernervous and unrelaxed approach to the keyboard that makes any one thing he does fatiguing to the ear and sometimes the eye.\n\nAs crummy as his RCA recordings are, these DGG recordings makes them sound trancendantal.  I keep a few of them in my vast CD collection of mostly super quality recordings for comparison purposes only, to illustrate what a crappy pianist and musician he was.  By the time these DGG recordings were made, he was so past any considerations concerning correct style and composer's intentions that the interpretations, if you want to call them that, are absolutely haywire.  DGG must have recorded them only for the subsequent monetary rewards.  To \"musicians\" like Horowitz, the music they play is nothing more than the fancy clothes they put on to impress the intellectually vapid and ignorant.\n\nI hope all of you Horowitz fanatics are both shocked and perplexed to see their hero so trashed and ill-respected.  So unhappy, but it's long overdue.  His performances are nothing more than case studies for musical archeologists and pathologists.","2754":"I've been a gargantuan fan of Caedmon's Call for nearly a decade.  They're music was simply superior to any other Christian group out there.  In the Company of Angels remains one of my cherished all-time albums of any band.\n\nBut I agree with another reviewer that I don't know where this band is going, and it isn't good IMO.  The music and lyrics of this album are inferior to past albums.  Cliff Young is their best singer, and he's not heard much.  And worse, they're heart for worship just isn't there anymore.\nCaedmon's Call --- if you read this criticism --- I adore you guys for the great music over the past decade and more.  But this albums stinks.  Return to whatever you were doing and whoever you were working with, because I'm going to have to listen to the next album closely before I acquire it.","2755":"Criticism - Tina D.\nTZVI EREZ, piano\n\nThis album is an absolute treat for Beethoven enthusiasts. Hard to presume that on one album or CD you find four (5)  Sonatas, namely the Moonlight Sonata as well as the Sonata Pathetique, consisting of three parts each, also Sonatas No. 13 and 17, plus the well known \"Fur Elise\" and the Spring Sonata - all compliment this outstanding musical treat. The last item on his program is the lovely Sonatina Anh. 5-Romanze- Andante, which no doubt, you will adore, as I do.  This program has been carefully chosen by Mr. Erez, who interprets Beethoven in an absolute realistic  exercise. This pianist`s touch is gentle where required and temperamental  where necessary, which creates an exiting interpretation of the music, yet at all times he strictly adheres to the composer's writings. These works are  performed on a 1912 Vintage Bosendorfer, which calls for no introduction.  This certainly will be a nice addition to your Beethoven collection.","2756":"Adore it as much now as I did 35 years ago.  Like fine wine, \"Breakfast in America\" just gets finer with the years, from the haunting \"Take the Long Way Home\", to the emotional \"Child of Vision.\"  It is such a legendary album, and grows more-so each passing year.  One of the very best albums in the last 50 years.","2757":"Such a gargantuan gargantuan failure.  A alluring piece of music to meant to be played on ullean pipes, but this recording is NOT; it's a keyboard synth arduous to sound like pipes; they don't..  The beauty of this Irish piece is the ethnic authenticity of the pipes and the building music with the strings.  Just no comparison when it's faked with a keyboard.  If you can, find a recording with Davey Spillane playing the pipes; it's magical. Tears will stream down your cheeks with the beauty of the melody and alluring strings and pipe.","2758":"I was looking for Video downloaded to my laptop so I don't have to go on website.\nI can play anywhere without going to website.","2759":"This is the second album from the victorian gothic duo.

I can't write a criticism strong enough recommending this product - seriously - and I've written plenty of crummy\/good criticisms here.  This is a great value, great product, and great for kids. Purchase of the DVD entitles you to audio files you can download to play in the car - the kids (even the older 3-year old) sings them over and over again!

Visit their website to check them out - [...] - you won't regret it!","2761":"It's 1979 and the Disco trend is in full swing.  Every song on the radio features chants, funky basslines, percussive breakdowns and whistles.  Some performers of this genre of music could either make the transition to the Post-Disco format and some could not.  Thankfully, Payne DID with an underground hit in 1982 entitled, \"In Motion\" on Sutra Records.  Prior to that, her last outing was this, her Capitol swansong.\n\nOn \"Hot,\" Capitol seemed to have locked her into a chugging, Latin-flavored, Anita Ward-ish \"Ring My Bell\" sound with the first single, \"Red Hot,\" but there was only one dilemma- the only bell being rung was the gong.  This was NOT a reflection on Payne, but on Capitol, her label, with its typical lack of artist promotion.  If you're a fan of traditional Disco formats, this album may be for YOU.\n\nDespite sexy photography, festive uptempos and alluring balladry, this album as well as its two predecessors (\"Supernatural High\" and \"Stares and Whispers\") didn't even touch the Disco\/Dance chart.  All three titles are worth exploring and are supremely recommended.  Additionally, you won't need any Q-Tips for THIS kind of Payne in your ears!\n\nHere's a little trivia for ya TOO:  Prior to her signing with Capitol, who offered her a finer financial option, she was offered a deal with Philadelphia International Records under Gamble & Huff.  Sadly, she didn't opt for the latter which just MIGHT HAVE proved the more beneficial choice for her career.  :-(","2762":"THIS NOT AN INTERVIEW OF JACQUES BREL.\nI WAS LOOKING FOR THAT..\n.EVEN THE MUSIC IS FROM JAZQUES BREL...\nIT IS A SCAM...AND BECAUSE IT'S AN FLAC , I CANNOT RETURN IT...\nTHEY SHOULD NOT CALL THAT AN INTERVIEW..\nIT;S ONLY $0,99..BUT I AM HAPPY IF I CAN CONSERVE IT DOR YOU..\nDON'T BE FOOL...DON'T TOUCH IT...DON'T ACQUIRE IT..\nTHANK YOU..EDMOND...","2763":"rip off!!! These are NOT the actual singers singing the songs!! Do not misuse your cash!!","2764":"The song is soft yet upbeat.  It has a alluring message and is sung wonderfully.  I searched for the song after hearing it on a tv show.  So glad I found it at Amazon.","2765":"I just downloaded the 2010 \"remastered\" version of the song \"With A Spirit\" from the album \"The Hits\", and I was shocked by the over compression. The song was absolutely smothered by pumping and wheezing effects due to meager compression techniques. Very unprofessional approach. Whoever remastered the song had NO BELIEF what they were doing. Mastering is as much art as science, and tracks can get totally messed up if you do it wrong. Mastering is much more than just compression. And trust me, I am no GOLDEN EARS audiophile. The effect is VERY pronounced, and very detrimental to the quality of the song.\n\nBecause of the meager quality of the remastered version, I chose to download the original 2009 version of \"With A Spirit\" from the album \"009 Sound System\" to see if it might be finer, and the difference was like night and day. The original version sounds much, much finer. No extreme compression. No pumping and wheezing effect. Very good dynamics, with crisp highs and rich lows. Plus I was surprised to see that the bitrate of the original version FLAC was higher than the remastered version... 292 kbps for the original 2009 version as opposed to only 280 kbps for the 2010 remastered version.\n\nListening to them side by side, you can definitely hear a big difference. The remastered version sounds muddy and squished. The original sounds clear and dynamic. So definitely get the original 2009 version. It is a higher bitrate file, and just plain sounds finer. It is 39 seconds shorter than the remastered version, but you hardly miss 39 seconds in a 10 minute song. DO NOT get the \"remastered\" version if you enjoy about audio quality!","2766":"I acquired the FLAC of this track as a pre-Christmas tongue-in-cheek gift for my wife, who thinks this may be the lowest Christmas song in many years.  Alas, radio stations here in Iowa adore to play it.  Oh well.  (I have nothing against Mulberry Lane, who appear to be lovely young women.  It's just a really harrowing song.)","2767":"I first encountered Richard Campbell's work through the Rock Band video game, where his \"A Christmas Rock Medley\" was sold as an addon song for the game.  I loved the track and went looking for more.  I found Orpheus, listened to a few samples, and acquired the album.\n\nThis has joined my list of cherished albums in just the few weeks I've had it.  It's a progressive rock concept album, like Rush's 2112 or Dream Theater's Metropolis Part 2.  It tells the story of Orpheus and Eurydice, a Greek myth about Orpheus, a legendary musician who marries a alluring woman.  She is killed in an accident, and Orpheus goes to the underworld to beg the gods to return her to life.  Hades takes pity on him and agrees that he can have Eurydice back on the condition that he walk out of the underworld without looking behind him to see her face.  Orpheus leaves the underworld but looks back before Eurydice manages to join him, and she is condemned to the underworld.  A short snippet of another myth is brought in--Orpheus is killed by Thracians--and the chorus closes the tale.\n\nThe instrumentals are all performed by Campbell, who is veritable polymath of music: he plays drums, guitar, keyboard, and bass on this album.  He also wrote the arrangements, as well, and his enjoyment of Dream Theater shines through here; this album may not be as complicated as a typical DT track, but it could easily be mistaken for a side project from any of the members of DT.\n\nWatch the preview on YouTube at[...] and decide for yourself if this is what you want.","2768":"Zhasmin CD Da!

I also liked 6 and 13.\n\nThe CD is packaged a little differently, kind of a booklet form with some nice pictures of Zhasmin and a lot of text, but you finer know Cyrillic to read it.\n\nAll in all, if you're a Zhasmin fan, it's a good album.","2769":"I wish I would have read the other people's criticisms before purchasing it.  A bunch of karaoke caliber covers.  Ghastly.  Absolutely ghastly.","2770":"I was hoping that perchance, just perchance, I could get around 20 of the 100 songs to be to my liking.  Silly me.

The recordings cover the prime 1970 to 1974 period and feature the Marty, Eve, Paul, Peter [Doyle]and Lyn line up. A few tracks recorded in 1973 and 1974 have Peter [Oliver] replacing his name sake who quit the band in 1973.\nThe mix of Circles is a abhorrent rehersal style mix where music and vocals simply don't blend and I can only think Polydor must have lost the distinguished verson that was originally released.\nBeg, Steal or Borrow was hardly the New Seeker's greatest hit although it brought them internaational recognition as the UK 1972 Eurovision Song Contest entry.  The distinguished B side to that original single One by One features on this CD as do a few lesser known album tracks Brother Adores Travelling Salvation Show with lead vocal by Peter Oliver and the enjoyable frothy Dance Dance Dance - the first NS album track I ever heard nearly thirty years ago.\nAll together a happy journey down memory lane but the New Seekers music deserves a more ambitious compilation next time.\nRT","2774":"Great music Mr. Jackson","2775":"Abhorrent...

I think it's one of the most important things that's transpired in classical music recording in the past 20 years.  That's because Haas is a real scholar, and he has gone to great lengths to make this series as thorough as his Decca budget would allow, and to record music by a wide variety of composers  -- some who made it and some who didn't.  In fact, if you become interested in this topic, as I did, Haas has recently released an distinguished book on this topic, published by Yale, I think.\n\nThe performances are all strong. This CD gives you short cuts by lots of composers, not entire works.  But it gives you an belief of the unreal richness of the (mostly Jewish) musical scene in Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia in the 1920's and early 1930's.","2777":"Hammock has been creating unreal songs for years now, and have never stopped evolving their sound.  This EP has already become one of my cherished records of the year with its delicate arrangements and moving tones.  You can hear the trademark Hammock guitar, as it fades in and out of the songs with an almost ethereal grace.","2778":"Others have said this is his best? I wholeheartedly DISAGREE. When I acquired this, it was because I already had two of his other CD's, and I loved both of them. (There was one song on each of those CD's that I didn't like, so I assumed I would like nearly all of these ones, too.) Wish I had bothered to listen to the tracks here on Amazon first. I would have saved myself the cash. The only song on this whole CD that I liked was \"Hidden Away.\"  Everything else was Josh's gorgeous voice, singing craptacular lyrics. Oh, except for the first track... that doesn't even have Josh SINGING on it. (When I acquire a CD by a renowned VOCALIST, I expect to get his voice in every single song. Unpleasant surprise here.)\n\nI used to think that Josh would sound good, even if he were singing in Pig Latin.  This CD proves me wrong. He still has a gorgeous voice, no matter what he sings, but I just could not get past the ghastly lyrics or the odd-sounding arrangements.","2779":"As one of Michael W. Smith's biggest fans, and also a bluegrass affectionado, when I saw this in the store the other day I was genuinely excited.  Nontheless, I have been pretty disconcerted in what I've heard. Overall, the album is lackluster and has an \"accessible-listening\" feel to it.  Secondly, there are no vocals, and MWS' music really isn't his without them.  Thirdly, there are at least four tracks on the album that aren't even MWS songs.  Sure, MWS recorded \"Awe-inspiring God,\" but if I were Rich Mullins, I'd be offended that one of his most famous songs is on an MWS tribute album, since it was him that made it famous and not Smith.  The same goes for \"Breathe\" and \"Above All\", which MWS recorded, but are not necessarily \"associated\" with him.  All it would have taken was to poll some fans before hitting the studio and this would have been avoided.\n\nOn the plus side, the music is extremely meditative, as I alluded to with my \"accessible listening\" comment.  Therefore, it makes for good calming ambiance music. If that's what you're looking for, you'll not be disconcerted, but for authentic MWS and authentic bluegrass, look elsewhere.","2780":"I only ordered the FLAC of One In A Million, but I presume this song is on the same vibe as a, Michael Jackson R&B song.

I had heard the song at the skate rink and I liked the groove.  The 30 second sample does not show the rap part of the song.  After  I acquired it and really listened to it, I was disgusted by it.  Too crummy because it is a great dance track.  He had to mess it up with vile rap lyrics.  Even though I paid for it I deleted them from my FLAC player, laptop and my amazon cloud.  Next time I am going to use YouTube.com to listen to the full versions first before buying.","2783":"I have heard this song a lot lately, in various stores and pumping through the loudspeakers at the gym before I turn on my ipod.  It sounds like something that was designed by a committee to hit that splendid combination of catchy, trendy and absolutely inoffensive.  Somehow it's also gratingly bothersome and sticks in your (your here being \"my\") head for days after it's been heard.  It's worse than \"It's A Small World After All.\"  Perchance it's the familiarity of the \"Time Of My Life\" lyric that adds the hook, because the rest is comprised of a startlingly unoriginal dance track with generic lyrics about losing control on the dance floor and being freaky freaky, etc., which should, in theory, just blend in with the rest of the background noise.  I might just walk out of the next store where I hear this playing if I am near the exit and don't have a full cart of groceries which I will have to abandon. To the powers that be who decided to assault my ears with the repeated plays of this little gem, please, for the adore of all that is good in the world, pick something else.","2784":"Chrisette Michele is a true Songstress!

So Glad to have Chrisette in my music collection!!!","2785":"Sadly, a failure.  This is a charming work by the late Enlightenment polymath Francois-Andre Danican Philidor (1726-1795). From a musical family, he started as a choir boy in the Chapelle Royale, and continued to rise in the King's musical service.  But while performing and composing, Philidor apparently learned the game of chess, and over a number of years, rose up to become Europe's greatest chess player.  And Philidor was no slouch at composing either (mostly opera-comique) during the era of Gluck, Monsigny, and Gretry in Paris. \"Le Sorcier\"is a two-act work, a kind of Singspiel in French (no recitative, just spoken dialogue) somewhat in the folk-opera style of Rousseau's \"La devin du village\" from a decade earlier. The premiere of \"Le Sorcier\" in Paris in 1764 was moderately successful, and the very young Mozart was in town at the time; it's possible that \"Le Sorcier\" could have influenced Mozart in his own young Singspiel composing.\n\nThe dilemma here is the performance.  It's.....harrowing. (It pains me to say that.)  The singing is the main culprit:  sopranos wobble all over the place, and tenors sometimes can't even reach up to hit the notes they're supposed to.  The orchestral work, while not as crummy, is nothing memorable. The excuse that this is a provincial group (the Orchestre de Rennes) doesn't fly; in classical-performer-rich Europe, even local groups can often turn in distinguished performances, and there might even be a few U.S. university groups that could do finer than this.  The one minor positive here is that, since all the performers are French, pronunciation during the spoken dialogue is distinguished.  Indeed, one occasionally gets the impression that the performers believed they were putting on a play with music segments.\n\nBut \"Le Sorcier\" is a lively, saucy work that is worthy of a finer recording.  This is the ideal kind of work for Ryan Brown and his Opera Lafayette, who've turned in several distinguished performances of works from this period.","2786":"I was really excited to hear Sam Beam's newest creation mostly after seeing him live this fall and getting a preview of the upcoming album.  I took note when he covered \"Such Great Hights\" and instantly fell in adore with his voice.\n\nWalking Far from Home is a brilliant track that finally seems to give Sam a voice rather of the whisper we all know and adore.  And what a voice!  Even though the song is astonishing, this track seems to be a little over mastered.  And sadly that continues to the other two.\nSummer in Savannah when played live has such depth to its sound.  Over-mastered and flat sound on the recording.\nHearing Biting your Tail this way scares me.\n\nThere is something big that these recordings are missing. I really hope that Sam Beam comes out with a LIVE ALBUM soon to show the world these songs' true colors and sound.","2787":"My house is next to 4 lanes of major-street traffic, and to mask the sound at night, others have suggested I get a box fan.  For the volume of a box fan's noise that I'd need, I didn't want the air flow that came with it.  I've struggled a stand-alone white noise machine, but that particular one wasn't loud enough to mask any one thing, even on its highest volume.  So I looked for a CD of white noise or box fan sound effect.  Until I started looking, I didn't realize there were other \"colors\" of noise.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  It has a deeper or lower tone than white noise, so it doesn't sound as harsh, IMO.  I just wish I'd've found this cheap solution before I acquired a box fan and a white noise machine!  I can still use the box fan, but the white noise machine is history now that I have this.","2788":"I struggled to purchase this song on the Amazon App for BlackBerry but rather of getting this one song the app struggled to get me to download the whole album. I had to repurchase this song and one of the other ones I was arduous to download on my laptop. Now I'm arduous to figure out how to get a refund. Adore the song but the technology could be finer.","2789":"One of my cherished albums but the vinyls are all warped. My order was warped. They replaced it. The replacement was warped. Unless you wanna put in the work to unwarp it just acquire a cd or download","2790":"For me it is fine. Just not what I expected. I fathom it's a matter of personal appeal. Nontheless David Binion is an awe-inspiring artist","2791":"Doris is one of my beloved!  Pity her choice of songs leave a lot to be desires.  I can now chose from this album.","2792":"Being the President of the Australian Knappertsbusch Association, sometimes I take a hit for the team. That's fine. Bring on Rene Jacobs and his Freiburg Barockorchestra! Man-Permer brood of conductors (Rattle, Dudamel and Ticciati) - do your lowest! But beyond good and evil and whatever bell curves you enjoy to nominate, there lies the domain of Maximiano Cobra, the Sauron of his profession and breaker of nations. Exposition and developmental repeats, invariably observed, are his Nazgl. Who has the wherewithal to withstand his onslaughts? There are reports that Saddam Hussein loaded up on his discography as WMDs - and indeed, the Scuds that were fired off at Israel in the First Gulf War had their warheads removed and replaced with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/J-S-Bach-Die-Kunst-Der-Fuge-The-Art-of-Fugue-Bwv\/dp\/B003O9I0YM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">J.S.

With steam coming out of my ears, I cannot say for sure. The development in the finale of K 550 is reputed to represent someone going mad. Evidence is now at hand - just look in the mirror!\n\nI was once a member of the Old Firm. It's not about moral judgments or existential bets anymore. Jesus and the Blessed Virgin can only do so much. I'm beyond that. My old allegiances have been burnt away.

I do not presume that for one second. An investigative journalist (Bob Woodward) once told me that its constituents spent time in the Soviet Gulag - indeed, most of them broke bread with Alexander Solzhenitsyn in the camps beyond the Arctic Circle. Trust me: they should have stayed there.\n\nTo add to the terror, one \"George Schatzkamer\" (remember his name when the wolves howl at night) routinely claims on Amazon that Cobra is the equal of \"Furtw&auml;ngler, Knappertsbusch, Klemperer, Mengelberg (and) Golovanov.\" Under normal circumstances, I'm not a conspiracy buff but I wonder whether this Seinfeld-inspired figure is hardwired to Cobra himself.\n\nIn the remains of the day, one contemplates the half-life of Plutonium-244, the Great Dying of the Permian extinction event and the loss of legions in the Teutoburg forest. I can do all these things - and more - if you stand by me.","2793":"For those of you old enough to remember the Rumiko Takahashi anime Maison Ikkoku, this song will sound spooky familiar. That's because this is a \"21st Century Version\" of the show's original opening title theme, titled \"Hello! Sadness\" in the United States. Both the original version and this new recording are performed by Saito Yuki.\n\nThe original song was released in 1986, with this version being released in 2007. That's a 21 year gap, guys and girls. Ignoring for a moment how old that makes me feel, I have to confess that I wasn't initially very keen on the new version. There's definitely a lot of nostalgia tied to the original recording, but that's not the only dilemma. 1980s J-pop has a very particular kind of sound, one that I grew fond of over my many viewings of Japanese anime from the era. There are some great synth elements to the original recording of \"Hello! Sadness\" that are simply missing from the new arrangement, with new elements being added in for flourish (such as the occasional touch of electric guitar). I suppose this was done to give it a more modern feeling.\n\nAfter getting over the initial nostalgia shock, I really grew to appreciate the new recording. Saito's performance is still relaxed and alluring, and the new arrangement is  just as moving now as the original was then. I sort of wish the album would have included the original slice as well -- you can't currently find it for sale on Amazon -- but that aside, the song is well worth it if you like melodic J-pop or were a fan of Maison Ikkoku.","2794":"Rick Cutler's latest collection of piano instrumentals is a moody and evocative affair worthy of the album's equally atmospheric title and cover.\n\nThe 18 tracks contained on the CD are very cinematic in feel, which should come as no surprise since Cutler writes and performs music for film and television. He also served as Gregory Hines's keyboardist and musical director for 18 years and currently tours as Liza Minnelli's drummer, and has also worked with scores of other notable artists in between, giving Cutler an edge as a brilliant composer and a seasoned musician.\n\nCutler is a crafty tunesmith, always drawing you in with captivating hooks, sometimes giving you what you anticipate, and other times taking you in unexpected directions, yet leaving you musically satisfied. The compositions, which include tips of the hat to such classical and jazz influences as Debussy and McCoy Tyner, are subtle and understated and function as a sort of tonic for the psyche.\n\nInterspersed throughout the album are three \"Alien Landscapes\" that exemplify Cutler's simultaneously adventurous and eerie sensibilities. With the CD as a whole, Cutler has definitely cultivated an artistically and intellectually stimulating sonic landscape for inner reflection and deep reverie.","2795":"I had heard the opening fragment of the first track 'Red House' somewhere and pondered this promises to be an interesting, modern, arrangement of an eighteenth-century country dance. Buying the CD proved to be a big failure.  It is as though they do not think the melodies are able to stand on their own; from the very start of each track the tunes are decorated in, to my mind, a rather sickly fashion, where all the musicians must play something, nontheless fragmented, all the time.  The pianist comes in for most of the blame here, vigorously scaling, arpeggiating and trilling all over the place so that the humbler wind and string players are relegated to the background even if they have the principal theme : not that the principal theme stays constant for very long as previously mentioned.  There is an overall impression of improvisation which, praiseworthy when done well, often results here in strange harmonies and overlaps which undermine the shape and feeling of the piece so that major or minor tonality has barely any effect.  Incessant decorative twiddles and runs of the piano in a higher register than the main theme trivialise all the pieces and become very tiresome thoughout.  The pianist is obviously a dominant member of the group and quite skilled, but should have been toned down in the recording for overall balance.  String and wind players play tiny irrelevant fragments when the piano has what should be a solo.  It seems as though they reach a consensus about a chord and as long as each plays something vaguely belonging to that chord it will be FINE.  Inevitably, the rhythms suffer, indeed, are sometimes lost in this jumble.  As a country dancer of nearly 40 years experience I have survived many dances where live music has failed to live up to its expectation: this is the first commercially produced CD of country dance music I have acquired which leaves me with the same feelings.","2796":"Michael Milton\nThrough the Open Door (Music For Missions)\nReleased January 2011\nRobert Ham\nStyle: Acoustic folk\/country; compare to Neil Young, Steven Curtis Chapman, Dan Fogelberg\n\nTop tracks: \"Eclogue for the Church Triumphant,\" \"Mississippi-Louisiana Line,\" \"The Gadarene\"\n\nIs there any one thing Michael Milton can't do? He's written numerous books, leads the Reformed Theological Seminary, and hosts a Bible study program on DIRECTV. And he has now released three CDs of plaintive spiritual folk that are musically opulent and emotionally stirring. Milton and his collaborators--including singer\/songwriter Michael Card--have crafted an uncommonly varied set of songs, ably tackling bluegrass, lite rock, and country. It skews too heavily on the side of mellow, leisurely paced material, but still pulls off some unexpected moments like the arresting strings and piano that mark the closing track, \"Eclogue for the Church Triumphant,\" which, heard free of Milton's reading from Revelations 21:5, reminded me of no less than the Lou Reed\/John Cale collaboration Songs for Drella.\n\nThis criticism is Copyright  2011 Christianity Today ([...])","2797":"I played my way through 2 LPs of this concert and loved every minute of it. When the technology became available, I transferred one of the LPs to a CD. Since this set never came out in any other format, I strongly urge lovers of French-Canadian ballads and of chorale music to purchase a vinyl disc and do the transferring themselves.\n\nOne side is devoted to Christmas music, the other to adore ballads. If the Chorale Bach de Montreal is perchance a bit starchy for a few of these selections, this does not detract from the beauty of the overall product. Tres bien all the way.","2798":"Adore this album when it came out years ago, regrettably what I received was a major failure.  First the album covered was in very meager condition which I can live with given I acquired this used.  The real bummer came when I pulled the album out and noticed that it was not Tom Jones Live in Las Vegas, but some other album!  Misuse of $$$.","2799":"I adore the music on this album (especially the first and last tracks), and the playing of Goldberg, Coryell and Subramaniam is First-rate throughout. Nontheless, the reason for my low rating has to do with the audio quality of the FLAC version. It's basically ripped from a scratchy vinyl version! Seriously, if they really needed to make an FLAC version from a vinyl copy, they couldn't find one to use that was in finer condition?? The vinyl copy I have sounds superior.\nIf you are a fan of these musicians and have a turntable, try to get a vinyl copy rather. Otherwise, the FLAC version is finer than nothing, but definitely not as good.","2800":"Amazon's new cloud music system or whatever it's called apparently struggled to take over all my stored FLAC files during the download and is so convoluted that I could never locate the downloaded file on my laptop.  So I've never played it.

This is bothersome. Listen if you can before purchasing. It may just be my preference, but it sounds like someone wadding up paper or a fire crackling....I had to look around before I discovered it was the audio. I pondered there was a fire in my house. I pondered perchance I should just listen and see if it got finer.\n\nIt did not. It was abhorrent. If you are used to the more soothing type binaural beats or subliminal audios, skip this one. It did not make me more positive....it made me annoyed.","2802":"While the sounds are astonishing, I have one REALLY big gripe that should be a gargantuan deal breaker for most people.\n\nHERE'S MY DEAL BREAKER:\nAbout four seconds in, a narrator comes on to read a disclosure.

Essentially, it's ambient sounds to drown out any other, distracting, sounds.  Extremely bothersome and very distracting.  Imagine being absolutely relaxed, you're feeling good; daydreaming even.

It was fortuitous. I had this CD, a gift my freshman year in college, that I kept on rotation so much that I wore it out. I have been searching for a new copy to call my own for about 7 years, looking everywhere. Not even Metropolis Records, the label, could help me. (Curious.) Of course I acquired it about 45 seconds after I read my email. It arrived in a timely fashion and I have felt entire ever since. The only dilemma is that, for whatever reason. when I get to Track 3 (Project Pitchfork) the CD catches about halfway through the song (a real travesty) and I am unable to listen to the rest of it. It is strange because #1 the CD was still in the plastic when it arrived, #2 I have a boss CD player in my car, and #3 it is only at that certain part on this one CD. I have no problems with any one thing else I own. So, hmmm. Not enough to ruin my enjoyment. Overall I would absolutely acquire this again. And again. And again, and you should too. Best compilation CD in the history of compilation CDs.","2805":"I play it for background soothingness....my guy friend who plays the piano also, adores it and this copy is for him.

Well, here are my terms - I have an expectation that the quality of the downloaded music will be good according to most people's standard of digital music.

I am also very connected to Angels, and I presume that through meditation, visualization, listening, praying and envoking the Archangels and Guardian Angels, that they can be with us at all times, under all circumstances, and helping us with every aspect of our lives. I presume we can heal Physically and Emotionally by communicating with our angels on a daily basis from a place of adore and gratitude.\n\nI Do a lot of Angel Work, Crystal Therapy, Color Therapy, Chakra Clearing and Centering,, meditation, Visualization, Guided Imagery, Yoga etc..and they are all connected. I also spend as much time in Nature as possible, spending time in nature with the living breathing spirit of Mother Earth and her wisdom, with trees, fresh air, flowers, water, sunshine, moon, grass, rock formation etc.. is just another way to reinforce the healing energies that are available to us if we can just tap into them.\n\nI have a lot of Audio CD's of guided meditations, imagery and visualizations that I adore that mostly encorporate Angels and\/or nature into them since that is what resonates with me personally.\n\nThe reason I am so impressed with Danielle Dove's \"Meditating with Angels\" and gave it 5 stars, is because she encorporated  the aspects of healing with BOTH Angels AND Nature. She manages to sooth and relax you with her alluring Angelic calming voice, while explaining why nature and Angels are so important to our health and well being, and how they can heal us.  Danielle leads you through alluring, peaceful meditations focusing on each Chakra,one at a time, to help you Clear and open your Chakras energies for more adore, light and healing.\n\nAnother thing that I really liked about Danielle's Chakra meditations, is that she does focus on each one seperately for a nice amount of time, yet, they all seamlessly transition into one another. Danielle starts with the Root Chakra, and then as she progresses upward to each additional Chakra, incorporates the new clearing and openess from the preceding one you just worked on, into the next one, then those two into the next one, and so forth, so you can really feel how they are not just all seperate energy centers within us, but are in fact all connected on a very fundamental level.\n\nI have heard some CD's where you feel almost 'rushed' to move from one pondered to another, or one feeling to another, having to transition and visualize quickly in order to keep up with the speaker... which in my opinion, no matter how good the content is, is not relaxing or effective, because without being able to fully relax and open, you cannot get to the place of inner work you need to get to. I have several CD's that I adore the content of, but listen to during the day while working or so forth rather, because they cannot relax me for a meditation sessiion do to the fast pace of the content.\nDanielle does a fine job of not talking, or 'moving' through her explanations or guided meditations too quickly, thus allowing you time to fully relax, \"sink\" into the comfort of her voice. and become still in mind and body, to be able to focus absolutely on what she is saying, and visualize it, and literally feel it.\n\nDanielle's CD \"Meditating with Angel's\" also has the most glorious backround water sounds that plays at just the right volume. It doesn't overpower her voice, or distract you from the meditations, nontheless, you can hear it softly in the backround which is just splendid, and adds the extra element of relaxation and connection with nature.\n\nI supremely recommend this CD! Thank you Danielle, for a wonderfully enlightening CD that I will treasure as one of the very best in my entire collectiion. I hope to see much more related content from you in the months and years to come!\n\nAngel Blessings!","2814":"Kat Craig is one of my cherished singers on YouTube so of course I am happies that she finally has a song on amazon dot com.  A haunting ballad by a talented singer with a hauntingly lovely voice, and not to be overlooked!  It was worth the wait.","2815":"FINE, everybody knows the deal with Charlie Hunter.  He plays either a 7 or 8 string custom guitar (mostly 7 these days) with some bass strings and some regular guitar strings, and fanned frets.  The set-up allows him to play the bass line and the guitar line simultaneously like some freak of nature.  Usually, though, he plays with a band and if you didn't know what was going on, you wouldn't realize that the guitarist and the bassist are the same guy, playing without overdubs.  On Public Domain, he plays unaccompanied, so there is nobody else to distract from the shear genius of his instrumental work.  The title of the album refers to the contents-- all of the tracks are old pieces that exist in the \"public domain,\" meaning that nobody holds the copyrights, so anyone can record them.  If you are a fan of traditional blues, jazz and folk, you will know most of the songs.  The cool thing is, though, that if you don't look at the track list, you will still have to think hard about what some of the songs are while listening to them because Hunter updates and personalizes the pieces so well.  The mood is lively, and the guitar work is as good as any one thing Hunter has ever recorded.  If you are looking for the more funk-influenced stuff he has done lately on albums like Mistico and Copperopolis, you won't find as much of that here.  This is more like his Duo album with Leon Parker, both in the stripped-down nature and the more straight jazz aesthetic.  Hunter is channeling his Joe Pass\/Lenny Breau influences more than his John Scofield influences.  I wish Hunter would record more like this.  His only other unaccompanied album (Solo Eight-String Guitar) isn't exactly a widely available cd.  That puts Public Domain up there with the Leon Parker Duo album as one of my cherished Hunter recordings.\n\nFurther listening: Phil DeGruy.  DeGruy plays a 17-string guitar.  No, that's not a typo.  He plays unaccompanied, and frequently records wildly re-imagined old gems, kind of like Hunter does on this album.","2816":"Four stars for recording quality. Four stars for Maria Da F, although it's probably not fair to knock off a star because she's not Amlia. But so far in my investigations of female fadistas, I like her second best. Which is saying a lot, because I've struggled a generous hunk of them. (I'm not a fan of Mariza, but that's another story entirely.)\n\nNontheless--two stars off because every one of these tracks is present on the 2014 release, \"Fado Essencial,\" and \"Essencial\" has four more tracks. I can't swear that the versions are the same and don't have time right now to check fado by fado, but I've listened to the one track that's titled somewhat differently, and it seems to be identical with the one on \"Essencial.\"\n\nSo unhappy not to be able to give a more detailed criticism of voice and fados, but I haven't time right now and pondered I'd get this up quickly in case it would conserve someone else $10 or so.","2817":"Je ne peux &eacute;valuer ce produit ainsi que les 3 autres que j'avais commend&eacute;s en mme temps car je ne les ai pas reu.

Nontheless, the hook is just ridiculous, and the beat is so driving that this deserves to be a hit in clubs.

I have no use for this song so it was a misuse of cash.","2825":"This album is an unreal acquire, having most of the music Rooster Teeth had created for their 8th season of Red vs. Blue. It's also got a few extra tracks that are sure to please any fan of the series. Who can't adore Sarge and Caboose singing in character? Just a word of warning to something I encountered: this soundtrack does not include a clean version of the music played during the final fights in the show. Two versions are included under the title of \"Red vs. Blue\", but they have vocals attached. Not that I entirely mind, but if you're arduous to find that particular track in a clean form, it won't be here.\n\nRegardless, this is an unreal soundtrack, and well worth the cash.","2826":"Redman has been my cherished rapper since he guest featured on EPMD's \"Hardcore\" on their sophomore album \"Business As Usual\". \"Muddy Waters\" is still one of my cherished albums of all time. I'm extremely disconcerted with \"Reggie\". If Red was arduous to figure out a way to alienate his loyal target audience he accomplished it with this album. Lyrically he is still \"Red\" but those tracks are straight junk. I would expect one of these new \"Here Today, Gone Tomorrow\" artists (and there are many)to use tracks like this not a Hip Hop legend. The one thing I've always loved about Redman(his loyal followers would probably agree with me on this) is that he was always in his own lane-a lane he created. His sound was unique to him and there was no one else like him. He has gotten away from the sound and style that made him Redman. He is still one of my cherished rappers I just hope he comes correct on his next project.","2827":"It is obvious that Def Jam did not put much effort into producing or marketing this album.  It is clear that this album was the last of the contract and they're fine with putting out a meager product. If you're hoping for another magnum opus like Whut? Thee Album, this is more like What Iz This Ablum? Redman has sub par lyrics that are rarely clever or pondered provoking, and the disc is absolutely devoid of any lively even with Method Man's appearance where the two just do a verse rather of riffing off each other with their witty repartee? This should have been halted in production? Redman wasn't into it and it's a bitter finale for a Def Jam great.  True fans will listen and enjoy little sparks of the old Red, but Doc is so much more than this.  Nontheless, The one thing I can say is that he at least struggled to stick to his roots.  At least it's not rediculous autotuned metaphors worthy of a 12 year old which is what has become of the bitter state of mainstream rap music today, referring to it as Hip Hop would be just too kind.","2828":"The music is alluring and I adore it.  BUT THE TITLES DON'T MATCH THE MUSIC.  HOW BLOODY HARD IS IT?!","2829":"I had high hopes for this, lord knows my husband doesn't help, but sadly there is still no boom to my bada.

This is particularly egregious in the case of \"one hit wonders,\" as the artist's one brief moment of fame is hidden from unsuspecting listeners by these soundalikes. In a few cases, such as the Spiral Starecase's \"More Today Than Yesterday,\" truth in advertising wins out by relabeling the artist \"Pat Upton Formerly of Spiral Starecase,\" but for most of the cuts the artist is listed by their original name, and no notation is made that these are modern re-recordings. As with all such compilations, some of the new versions are truer to the originals than others; a few may even be the originals, but without clearer documentation, it's hard to know what's what.\n\nThe version of \"Liar, Liar\" that opens the set sounds like the original, in wide stereo, and Ian Whitcomb's \"You Turn Me On\" also sounds like the real deal. But it's quickly downhill from there. \"Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah\" doesn't approach the grandiosity of the Phil Spector-produced Wall of Sound, and \"Incense and Peppermints\" sounds more like a MIDI-arrangement with worn vocals than a psych-pop masterpiece. \"Rhythm of the Rain\" is sung as a folk song rather than latter-day doo-wop, and it's missing the signature celeste; several other tracks, despite good performances and solid vocals, shade the tempos a hair fast or slow, and have modern production that's too clean to reproduce the feel of the hit singles.\n\nNo doubt many of these recreations offer artists a chance to reconnect with royalties signed away in a flush of youthful innocence; they also offer die-hard fans an opportunity to hear an alternate to the well-known hits.

I adore audio books since I can listen while driving, working out, or right before bed with I-Pod.  This entire work is the unabridged (24 cds!) of his Law of Success volume.  The content is distinguished and more thorough than \"Think and Grow Rich\" so allows for deeper understanding and application.\n\nThe length of volume and readers limited inflections (I assume he is not arduous to color content) makes this monotonous for listening in long stretches.  That said, for 8.99 this is a truly great value and I would supremely reccommend!\n\nI would also reccomend Napleon Hill -\"In His Own Word\" which is the author in is \"own voice\"!","2832":"This is the 1950 Furtwangler\/La Scala RING with Flagstad in a new remastering.  The sound is spectacular and we now have a new remastering that truly reveals the genius of Furtwangler in all its myriad orchestral colors.  The sound stage for both singers and orchestra is unprecedented for this 1950 Historic RING.  Never before have we heard such clear orchestra detail in such well balanced clean sound between the singers and pit.  Any other mastering of this RING, including Gebhardt, is left in the so called \"starting gate\" to use a horse race term.  It is truly SPECTACULAR!  It's as if, like AUDITE with their RIAS new radio master tapes of both Furtwangler and now Knappertsbusch live concerts of the 50's ARCHIPEL has been given new first generation distinguished radio broadcast tapes; and with many of these broadcasts now being legal to distribute (public domain), that could be the case.  Whatever the case, this new transfer or remastering is a gargantuan audio advance.  I don't need to repeat all the raves about this historic performance; except to say, NOW IT SONICALLY LIVES UP TO ITS REPUTATION.  The sound is now almost like distinguished studio MONO of the first tier.  Furtwangler is the true star of this RING. You hear things in the orchestra that no other conductor finds; yet, everything seems so natural and just right.  All the motives are so clear and all the climaxes just overwhelming.  Flagstad is magnificent.  Lorenz is great just at the end of a great career.  SUPREMELY, SUPREMELY RECOMMENDED!!!","2833":"First of all, I did not like the musical instruments and nothing seemed to be to my liking. That is it.","2834":"Actually John O'Banion's best album is the Japanese release \"Close Up\" which is an distinguished example of how sometimes less is more.  That album had a different arrangement of some of the tracks listed on this album and some of the tracks here are not on that album and yet it still had a very nice flow and appeared a much more cohesive and hence much more enjoyable to listen to album.  Until we get a similar release of that album then \"Danger\" will hold the mantle as The Great Voice's best album.\n\nMy introduction to The Great Voice was years ago as a child watching a program on tv called \"Solid Gold\" which was a big hit at the time. I was blown away when this unassuming chap came on and belted out in an unbelievable display of vocal range, tone and forceful delivery an extremely well written song called \"Adore You Like I Never Loved Before.\" I just loved the way the song combined forceful rock power chords with tender balladic lyrics which wasn't very common at the time but which was quickly imitated ever since. I remember ever since that night I spent many days arduous to find that track somewhere on cassette but with no success. I finally found it on a bootleg copy of a various hits compilation (there were many of these in those days).  What my brother managed to find in the meantime though was an original, legal version of \"Close-Up\" or the Japanese version of \"Danger\" on cassette which between ourselves we listened to until all the oxide fell off the tape.  It was just that enjoyable an album and although \"Danger\" is no \"Close-Up\" I fathom it'll have to do until we also get a mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version of \"Close-Up\" too.\n\nPleasant results usually follow the collaboration of great songwriters and great singers and we get no exception here. The Joey Carbone\/Richie Zito\/Kathi Pinto partnership on one side and The Great Voice on the other has resulted in a very strong release of adore song crooning in one of its finer incarnations.  Unlike the debut album which had one cover all the tracks here are originals.  There are many standout tracks here that show a vast improvement over the debut album release.  Tracks like my favourite \"Our Adore\", \"I'm The One\", \"Deep In the Night\", \"I Don't Want To Adore Your Adore\", \"Through the Eyes of Adore\", \"Take Me Back\" and the bonus track \"Inside This Heart of Mine\" are just very well written songs and the other 3 bonus tracks of live material add to the overall enjoyment of the main course.\n\nThe mlps release itself is not much to shout about not being one of the finer designs and assembly that I have ever seen but the sound quality is very good. Also included is a foldout containing all the lyrics in English.\n\nFor fans of the early 80s romantic ballad genre ala Jim Photoglo, Paul Davis, Dan Fogelberg etc this release comes supremely recommended!","2835":"I have been a big fan of Chris Cain for 20 years, buying any one thing of his I could find. When I saw his new cd \"So Many Miles\" on presale on amazon, I ordered it right-a-way.  When I first listened to the cd, I pondered it can't really be this crummy, so I listened to it three straight times on a trip to Kansas City.  It really is this crummy.  Chris still has a strong voice and his playing, as always, is great.  It's just that his vocals and guitar are stuck in some of the lowest songs I have ever heard.  The lyrics will make your cringe, and the horn tracks sound like a junior high band concert.  I'll never listen to this cd again, and I hope I can get $2 at the used cd store.","2836":"I acquired this because of the criticisms. Obviously the people who reviewed haven't had it for a year. The hose at the base split open so there was no suction. so like other users I duct taped it! Tacky I know but I didn't want to have to replace the stupid thing if the motor was still working! Then the roller stopped spinning. I called the company and they said they'd replace it but I had to pay to ship it to (probably $40 - $50) and pay to get a new one sent($20). So basically I could pay almost what you'd pay for a new one to get it replaced !!! I am beyond sick of buying a new vacuum every year! Everything is cheap and made for baloney!!!! They are made cheaply so you'll have to keep replacing them! Buyer beware!","2837":"Vivacity, warmth and lyricism will take you a long way in Mozart - a long, long way - but not to the end of the line. That's the terminal of artists who contest his kerygma in their marrow.\n\nFor all her merits - and dammit, I enjoy this venture - Annerose Schmidtt (ARS) is not in that class. She's too Via Media for her own good. Ornamentation is feeble and contrived. More rubato would go astray - why be so literal and so often at that? Metaphysics is a rarity in this cycle - and ever so worryingly, one could extend this comment to introspection per se. Nevertheless, ARS is so much lively, if you're prepared to accept her limitations (and the not uncommon let's-sight-read-the-score moments from Uncle Kurt Masur on the podium), this survey from the mid-Seventies is compulsive. The full-blooded symphonic contribution of the Dresden Philharmonic is reparatory.\n\nK 175 - The Pocket Rocket derives much of its mojo from timpani. Here it is obscured by the (silky) strings. In summary, this is a thumper in its outer movements whereas the Andante is unimaginative. This is Three Stars at best.\n\nK 238 - This is a well-proportioned reading. Nevertheless, the slow movement is under-characterised - and who would have pondered that such a thing was possible? This is a Three Stars job.\n\nK 246 - This is how to play the Ltnow! Indeed, it's the most symphonic version I've ever heard. While the slow movement could be more reflective, it does not detract from the wider affair. This is Four Stars easily. Great stuff!\n\nK 271 - This is the first real test (as some would say). Again, the recording is superb even if the piano prevails over the orchestra. The first movement is vibrancy itself but not much more than that (the same comment is applicable of the finale). While it might appeal to the Taliban, the slow movement is too fast and unreflective for my liking. This is Three Stars where the recording is solid analogue and nothing more.\n\nK 413 - Big bold and brassy - this is a performance of the F major Concerto like none other. It's almost a sinfonia concertante. That being said, the poetic elements are not lost. Four Stars in a canter. Great recording too\n\nK 414 - This masterpiece is played with ardour and delight with a piano-centric recording to match. I cannot fault this. What expectancy is on offer in the slow movement! How the orchestra sings in its prelude! It's enough to melt the sun. This could be the highlight of the set. Four Stars!\n\nK 415 - Oh for a more prominent timpani and brass - but man, everyone is betting the house here so who cares? Four Stars for sure!\n\nK 449 - Here is another massive test. Some - yours truly included - regard it as Mozart's greatest piano concerto. The Dresden Philharmonic offers a symphonic and yet-lithe-on-its-feet contribution. ARS could be more insightful but she's still great lively. This is Four Stars and enjoyable enough.\n\nK 450 - Lively, vivacious and perceptive, what's there not to adore? What a graceful opening to the Andante! Again, a virile bass-line underwrites this venture. This is a Four Stars job.\n\nK 451 - Again, timpani could be more prominent. Nevertheless, this unproblematic work is aligned with ARS's skill-set and she does not fail. Four Stars!\n\nK 453 - This is another Olympian test. To a certain extent, the vivacity of the music-making masks the lack of interpretative depth (for instance, the episode-in-the-minor of the Andante is feigned). This is a solid Three Stars job. There are no complaints re the recording.\n\nK 456 - This side of the Pearly Gates, no-one owns this concerto. Anda comes damn close. Again, I cannot fault the outer movements - and I adore the beefy involvement of the Dresden Philharmonic. The slow movement, played literally, is not the last word in tragedy. This is a Three Stars job even if it held my attention. The recording is FINE.\n\nK 459 - Again, I adore the symphonic opening with strong bass line - and much the same could be said of the finale wherein double basses and cellos bestride like colossi. This arrangement is not to the detriment of woodwind. The opening of the slow movement could be more nuanced (blame Big Kurt as ARS seems to follow his literalism). This is a Four Stars recommendation (just), underwritten by a fine recording.\n\nK 466 - Notwithstanding its musicality, there's no sense of menace here. ARS is far too literal. The Romance is on the fast side. Three Stars and I`m being generous.\n\nK 467 - I can appreciate Mozart as Bruckner - that's what we get in the opening prelude of the first movement from the strings which are vividly recorded - but reportedly there's a timpani and brass in the score and one would like to hear them in this masterpiece.  The slow movement is enjoyable at its breezy pace. This is a solid, musical Three Stars job. Its outer movements in particular held my attention.\n\nK 482 - this performance is Plain Jane on a crummy hair-day with zits. Come the big moments, nothing further eventuates - this could have been the genesis of Masur's reputation as a serial-deflator of tyres. The soloist does little to deepen the affair; the Greek Tragedy of the Andante is more like a satyr play. One Star is warranted.\n\nK 488 - the mojo is back in the outer movements which are great lively. Notwithstanding ARS's musicality, the Adagio is devoid of tragedy. This is a Three Star recommendation, underwritten by a fine recording.\n\nK 491 - a great recording and full blooded orchestral response are not going to redeem this semi-tough reckoning with the kerygma of the C Minor Concerto where Uncle Kurt sight-read the score on the day. Being devoid of introspection, this is a Two Stars job.\n\nK 503 - From the perspective of strings and woodwind, this is a great recording even if the meager timpanist down the back gets little airtime. If the symphonic response of the Dresden Philharmonic was ever going to resonate, it would be in K 503 - and it does so imperiously. ARS is a delight. Four stars all the way.\n\nK 537 - This performance features a great recording - for strings. Calling all timpani and brass - can you please make your way to the microphone! Enjoyable as this is, this performance accepts the Coronation's gallant credentials at face-value and does little with them; experience tells us that there's greater richness to be mined. Three Stars at best!\n\nK 595, as I undertook this survey, I became more and more worried for K 595 as it approached: at their lowest, ARS and Big Kurt can be as brainless as headless chickens.  While I adore the recording and symphonic response of the Dresden Philharmonic, this K 595 is as elegiac as a McHappy Meal. A solitary star is warranted.\n\nTo summarise, this is a middling endeavour. It has a place in the scheme of things. I can understand the viewpoint of the four-star reviewers: one cannot impugn its baseline musicality even if operates in a restricted sphere and its longevity is open to debate. This is damming in its own way, but if you're about to undertake an exacting road-trip, buddy up ARS and Uncle Kurt.\n\nThink not and be!","2838":"The choir sounds distinguished, but the female soloist is below par.  Regrettably, Amazon does not give enough pondered to what part of the classical song you are hearing.  Please have the technician loading the song for prospective buyer's criticisms actually ensure that you can hear the primary vocalist during the selection's play.","2839":"\"Black Crow Blue,\" the title track from Nathan Bell's most recent album on Stone Barn Records, opens with the question: \"Have you ever seen a sky so wide\/That you could fit the whole world inside. I have.\" He then inquires, \"Baby, can you see me now?\" Here in this tender ballad, inspired by writer Glen Hirshberg's Book of Bunk, Nathan displays his sensitive and attuned eye for poetic metaphors that are sparse yet accurate descriptors of adore, hardship, and what is, at times, the inexplicable journey we're all on in our lives.\n\nHe captures what it means to be alone and, particularly, what it means to put adore at the forefront of any one thing else that we think matters.\n\nIt is in this, with Nathan's sharp gaze at life, that his songs illuminate how we all are taken in and either worn smooth or left ragged by this journey. Nathan credits much of his inspiration for songs from the works of well-established writers: Hirshberg, Sebastian Matthews, and his father: poet, Marvin Bell, amongst others.\nYet, his songs stand as unique creative works in their own right as well. One doesn't need to know all of the literary references to still get his music.\n\nIn \"American Crow,\" Nathan describes his character Crow as a man who never stays put, symbolized by \" . . . tattooed wings beneath [his] skin.\" In this opening line, I hear echoes of the \"Crow's\" who have passed through my life. I acknowledge my own impulse to take flight at various junctures. When he sings, \"Black feathers\/Hollow bones\/Nowhere left\/For the light to go\/ Sitting on a fence post at the side of the road, American Crow,\" I'm reminded of Paul D in Toni Morrison's Beloved who \" . . . didn't presume he could live with a woman---any woman---for over two out of three months. That was as long as he could abide in one place.\"  I suspect that Crow, like Paul D, leaves because it's the only way he feels free, and it's a liberation that dodges heartache.\n\nNathan's songs lay bare the inclination to wrap ourselves in deceits so that we might avoid facing our own mortality and flaws. In \"Me and Larry,\" Nathan reminisces on his connection with the late-writer, Larry Brown. He sings, \"Somehow always in the end\/We become the tales we tell.\"  Later, he reflects, \"It was twenty years ago my friend\/When I pondered that we weren't mortal men.\"  He traces the trajectory of believing in time eternal just where it fades as we approach middle age, an age when we begin to experience the loss of others, once young with us.\n\nBlack Crow Blue, nontheless, isn't a bleak album.\n\nYes, Nathan writes about tough times, exploitation, and unfair treatment. But he never neglects the thread of adore or shard of hope that holds us together. We hear this in \"A Stone's Throw\" when he sings of a man barely getting by, reeling from a crummy economy and poverty. While others want to turn their heads in shame, the singer tells us, \"But I look them in the eyes\/Say man, it's me, don't you realize\/We're all we've got if we're going to survive.\" Ultimately, the song stresses that type of survival: through community, even in the face of unjustness.\n\n(A notable mention here: \"Stone's Throw Away\" was picked up by singer Lizanne Knott for her upcoming 2013 release Standing in the English Rain. She does a kick-ass rendition and arrangement, worthy of checking out.)\n\nOn the album's closing track, \"We All Get Gone,\" Nathan digs into a strict blues groove, his wailing harmonica getting as much play time as his vocals.  He moans, \" . . . I'm just traveling\/Watch me traveling away\/Cause get it right or get wrong, sooner or later\/We all get gone.\" Despite the resolute attitude of the singer, Nathan conveys a candor that is welcoming and intimate. I'm feeling as though I'm sitting at a coffeehouse table one dusky evening while Nathan strums, picks, toots his harmonica, and lights up the stage with his voice.\n\nThroughout Black Crow Blue, Nathan's vocals, measured and at times with a grittiness reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen, deliver the lyrics with clear-headed certainty of the stories he tells. His descriptive guitar playing, forceful when necessary, provides the clean well-structured melodies that turn his poems to song. In Nathan's writing are songs that encourage the listeners to claim the poetry of our own lives and to find the songs in others'. It's a good way to think about being in this world.","2840":"I am a fan of Frontline Assembly and KMFDM. This band is harrowing. I would never recommend to fans of those artists previously mentioned. This is bottom of the barrel music. From the generic non-clever L.S.D. name to the music to their image. It's like Hot Topic b.s. An insult to the electro\/industrial\/EBM music from the 80s.\nThe cover lookls like a F.L.A. rip off from their Wax Trax days.\nBe original! Again, the music is so harrowing that only the lowest of the lowest in horror movies would use and that's not a compliment. They're worse live. I never heard so many people say they wanted their cash back. Only people who seemed interested were the drunks.","2841":"CD quality is so crummy some of the songs are barely distinguishable. Tony Sandler and the late Ralph Young were a fine duo, incredibly talented, great chemistry--if you loved their act, DO NOT acquire this CD.","2842":"Yanni creates great music and this collection is not depressing. Nontheless, the quality of the recording itself is very depressing. The treble is not crummy, but there is no fullness or presence of sound. The recording itself calls for more amplification, mid range and bass. I have been satisfied with Sony recording before but this one is very very depressing.","2843":"The church I attend regularly plays a lot of contemporary music.  I like that, but I also enjoy hearing some of the music I grew up with.  When I visited another church we sang a hymn that I was not familiar with but the words were distinguished:\n\nMay the mind of Christ my Savior\nLive in me from day to day,\nBy His adore and pow'r controlling all I do and say.\n\nSo when I was back home I searched for a CD with this hymn and came across \"Everything Is Sacred.\"\n\nThe whole CD turned out to be a gem.  My cherished is the first hymn, \"Praise to the Lord, the Almighty\" but all of the songs are great.  I listen to this while I am out for a quiet run in the morning.","2844":"Basically just two guys talking about how they made millions but nothing really about how you can do it, I found it quite mundane and useless.","2845":"This is based on the magnificent one-man play, THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING OSCAR, written and performed by Micheal macLiammoir (1899-1978).  This present recording is an abridgment of the text (which I have in published form from Colin Smythe Ltd), and it cannot compare to the original because no one had as alluring a voice as macLiammoir (who portrayed Iago in the 1952 Orson Wells cinematic production of Shakespeare's OTHELLO.  I have never found the original recording on cassette or cd (I borrowed the lps from Library and recorded them onto cassette, but this recording by Gerard Plunkett is very good indeed, and it tells, as dramatic performance, the Life and Works of Oscar Wilde.  Wilde is, perchance, finer known today for the story of his life, and there are many fine biographies that tell the tale, as does Peter Ackroyd's debut novel of 1983, THE LAST TESTAMENT OF OSCAR WILDE.  Fascinating as Oscar's life is, it is good to see that his writings are now being taken seriously as works of literary worth (especially with the alluring hardcover editions from Oxford University Press).  This recording pays as much attention to the writings of Wilde as it does with the story of his life, and the readings from poems, stories, plays and epistles are delightfully performed.  Plunkett's voice is alluring and dramatic, and Wilde comes to life in this recording.  Supremely recommended.","2846":"This is the kind of album that I listen to when I need a good laugh. Songs like \"Unless You Call\" and \"Lonely\" are golden opportunities for this. The lyrics are just that ridiculous. To be fair, I accidently acquired this album while attempting to acquire an album by Kim Walker who is associated with Jesus Culture. Therefore, I am not the typical listener for this Kim Walker of \"Lifetimes.\" Regardless, this is music that makes me shocked he can make cash from it. I have no belief why two other people rated this album four stars. But hey, whatever floats your boat! If you enjoy, then go for it. But I recommend to listen to a few samples before purchasing.","2847":"Absolutely loathe this version of the song.  How in the world did this version get on the best of album?  The original version is a million times finer than this, yet, the original version is not available anywhere.  What a sham.","2848":"Let me start by advising people who are new to Mogwai, to not judge them by this song.\n\nI'm a big Mogwai fan, which is why it pains me to say that I don't really dig this track. I just think it's messy and unpleasant sounding, which is the polar opposite of their preceding work. I've always been drawn to Mogwai for their cinematic soundtrack-to-your-life kind of sound... but perchance they've gone a little more experimental than usual. Still getting the album, but this first single doesn't get me too excited.\n\nIn the meantime, please check out their other albums, like Rock Action, Young Team, and Mr. Beast.","2849":"In many ways I tend to view Klaus Doldinger in a similar way that I do Miles Davis. During his years with the fusion rhythm section Passport Klaus not only played saxaphone and composed all of the music but he also played the other melodic instruments as well such as the electric piano and meletron. Associated with the European music scene to such a degree they never got the type of international audience they probably deserved,Passport began their fifth album on the note of their creatively defining&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Hand-Made\/dp\/B001DJ7QC2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hand Made<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Looking-Thru\/dp\/B00005RZX4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Looking Thru<\/a>&nbsp;albums. The majority of those recordings were journeys to find what they came across here. A lot of people who have managed to discover Passport's fine and imaginative type of electric jazz  often describe this as their finest album. Don't know how I feel about that. But I can certainly see why someone might think so.\n\n  For one this album embodies just about all the qualities that make Passport special. There's the dreamy and often abstract nature of the arrangements in these compositions. Also the instrumental choices. The title song is the first example. Clocking in at over thirteen minutes it's an exciting journey from progressive rock type theatrics,into blues and than out and out funk. When Klaus comes in on sax,the sound he produces is rather soft and melodic compared to the phased electric keyboards,synthesizers providing the harmony. It's a alluring contrast of melody and rhythm. \"Homunculus\" is very rhythmically flamboyant but again never loses that center of instrumental control either. \"Jadoo\" and \"Will-O-Whisp\" on the other hand,perchance anticipating Doldinger's interest in film scores provide us with blacksploitation influence cinematic funk with a heavy dance orientation as well.\n\n  \"Albatross Song\",with it's breezier rhythm and the spare ballad \"Damals\" showcase the band itself playing in a somewhat more understated manner more in the league of how Klaus himself is playing here. Doldinger is a very moody player\/composer. Capble of being brooding and low key one moment and flamboyant to the point of being supremely aggressive the next.  The rhythm section of keyboardist Kristian Schultze,bassist\/guitarist Wolfgang Schmid and drummer Curt Cress are perfectly attuned to these shifting musical passions he tends to have. Even though they are European and tend to be localized in that area of the world,I still have trouble understanding why their sound never caught on. Perchance it was more that electric jazz\/fusion\/funk-jazz anywhere had a bit of trouble catching in,on many levels. On the other hand if one is interested in this type of music this definitely stands as an important part of that genre as well as being a strong and important release for Passport as a group.","2850":"Vendor MR. MAGAZINE is asking $109.99 for a USED(!) copy of Everest's pseudo-stereo re-issue of Cetra set 1248, which offers a radio concert performance of Puccini's MADAMA BUTTERFLY broadcast live from the studio of Radiotelevisione Italiana on 7\/26\/1954.  The performance itself deserves at least 4 stars;  the original monural Cetra transcription, at least 3 stars.  The Everest product on offer, nontheless, is notoriously EL-STINKO.  And MR. MAGAZINE's asking price of $109.99 is altogether preposterous.  Buyer, beware!","2851":"I am a gargantuan fan of the Inception soundtrack. I was royally disgusted after purchasing it that \"Mind Heist\" was not included. So I got really excited when I stumbled across this single .FLAC you can acquire.\n\nIt was depressing, and here's why:\n\nIt's got the same general tune (and is quite orchestral and alluring in-and-of itself). But if you want the exact, original feel of the trailer, do NOT acquire this one. This one is nice in its own right, but it's definitely a re-recording and not the original from the trailer.\n\nThe actual original \"Mind Heist\" can be acquired on Zack Hemsey's website.","2852":"depressing. it is also not part of the inception album. sample appeared finer than whole FLAC so I acquired it, but the whole FLAC was depressing. i would rather acquire from the inception album.","2853":"If you are a James Blunt fan then you surely already own this album. His newest album he explores some songs with a different twist. Moon Landing has a few songs which explore the space race, (Not a new topic, of course) with some interesting songs and interesting messages. You don't need to enjoy space exploration to enjoy the new album. The music in this album is astonishing and I play it over and over with the rest of his awe-inspiring albums. I have most on my cloud and they play for ever and I'm a happy happy fan.","2854":"I didn't get there last cd, but I heard some songs from this on youtube and on a whim acquired it, I had no belief what to expect, but what I am playing all the time at home, in my car and at work is pure bliss, this cd blends the brutality with soft passages perfectly, there is no weak track on this cd, music like this does not come around very often, i'm mesmerized at the brilliance of the cd, you don't have to like this band to acquire this, you just have to like metal... if you do not end up liking this cd at the end of your first spin, your the one with issues .. lol.. unless something else comes out of left field and surprises the heck out of me, this is gonna end up being my Cd of the year, I know Amon Amarth is coming out soon and so is Mercenary but damn if they don't have there work slice out for them, this cd is a monster, it's epic, it's everything you hope for when you acquire any cd and it's all on this one... Thank you Omnium Gatherum...","2855":"Obviously just my opinion, but you'd think that someone as acclaimed as Bailey is and who's been around as long as he has could make finer music.  It truly sounds like something a kid made in his basement - sort of a talented, but mindless wankery. I've heard play-along tracks that were way finer musically, and had finer groove. Seriously. It's just pathetic.\n\nReally trite, predictable stuff. Plus the titles are ghastly. Who names a song Ape School? I fathom it's all subjective though. If you want to hear Victor Bailey play, go acquire a copy of Weather Report's - Procession, or check out his Trio stuff with Larry Coryell and Lenny White.  This stuff, you can truly pass on.\n\nJaco, I miss you so...","2856":"Loved it and supremely recommend it for anybody into Destini Beard and Midnight Syndicate.","2857":"Posted this on a smaller release of this EP so I pondered I would share the same results here, as this is just a more expanded version of the release.\n\nI acquired \"Conserve Yourself\" on iTunes to give it a listen and check it out. It was the most abhorrent version of the song I have ever heard.\n\nAfter some research, I found out that it is indeed Christopher on vocals, but the ones performing the music has no ties with the band, Stabbing Westward. I even contacted Cleopatra Records, who informed me that it is Chris but not the remaining members.\n\nI'm unhappy I acquired just the one song. The lowest song purchase I have ever made.\n\nCleopatra Records has a history of releasing stuff like this. They just recently released a \"Trapt\" album titled \"Headstrong.\" Again, the vocalist, but doesn't sound like the band.\n\nThis EP is not only an insult to the band, as they really had no hand it's release, but an insult to the fans.","2858":"This is one of those rare cd's that you can put it on the first track and listen absolutely through it without skipping one song. also you can listen to these songs over and over, i've all of them 100 times accessible and i still adore listening to them. also a little side note, their concerts are amazingly lively and i can't wait for the 31st.","2859":"I'd adore to be able to criticism this, but I haven't been able to listen to it. I acquired this as an FLAC album. When I try to click on Download, Amazon tells me I've already downloaded it. And arduous to get through to their (Lack of) Help Center is next to impossible. But Amazon got my cash, so I fathom that's all that matters.","2860":"I am a baseball fan so this is entertaining to me.  While I enjoy the music, it is not my style.  Nontheless I enjoy the Baseball Project simply for the story in the song.  This song is no different.  It is a good story and a person can learn a little about baseball by listening to their songs.  Nontheless as I listen to it when I write this criticism, I find myself cringing about the music but sucked into listening to the lyrics.  This is a four star criticism simply becuase I am a baseball fan and enjoy hearing a good baseball story.  If this song had lyrics about barbies or trucks I would simply loathe it.  I have heard their entire first album and enjoyed the songs but I do not remember the singing being this depressing.","2861":"I first heard this alluring song at The Seraphim Center. We sang it to one person at a time as we walked around the church, looking into each other's eyes while holding their hands. It's only 4 lines long, sung over and over. It was a forceful exercise to remind us that we are more alike than we are different. \"I'm willing to open my eyes, to see your innocence, to see the child you are, a mirror of myself.\" This is on an older album of Donna Marie Cary's  and one of my beloved.","2862":"This CD consists ONLY of the chaconne, that is of 9 or 11 minutes of music. Nothing more!!! That is nuts. It cost $16!\nI think it was T S Eliot or W H Auden, perchance both, or Ezra Pound. Anyway someone said to be a convincing writer, be judicious in your use of exclamation points. But this ripoff elicits exclamations!\np.s. The music itself is stunning. Four star.","2863":"I remember this as being the best prtformance of the Fetite Suite.  Gut only 28 minutes on a CD???  I can think of lots of things that would increase the value. The lack of notes is not a dilemma for me.  Anyone who is going to seek this item out doesn't enjoy about notes.\n\nWhat would be an absolutely fine thing for this label to do is the first performance of Sheherazade by the conductor Issay Dobrowen.  It is 58 minutes of unmatcheable interpretation including a 20 minute second movement which because of its total spontaniety doesn't sound slow at all.  In fact its the best movement of a fabulously natural performance.  What EMI reissued a couple of years ago is the more politically correct 47 minute performance which still is very good indeed.  But, if you want the ultimate by a conductor steeped in this music . . . . . . . ?\n\nAnd then, there are the Glazounov 2nd, 3rd and 5th symphonies conducted by the vastly underrated Boris Khaikin.  the 2nd and 3rd, for sure, are superior to any one thing done since. Released in the 70s by EMI records in distinguished stereo.\n\nAnd for more, the first recordings ever of the Prokofiev 2nd and 3rd symphonies with Charles Bruck conducting a razor edged French Orchestra seemingly made to order for this overwhelmingly forceful music which has since been tamed by many conductors but never presented as excitingly as this! A French Columbia recording c1960.\n\nNeedless to say I would acquire these without hesitation as my LPs are kind of worn.","2864":"I acquired this product because Amazon had given me a two dollar credit for an FLAC.  I was disconcerted that I can only download the FLAC if I download the Amazon music player.  I already have three music players on my laptop, so I don't need another one.  Until they allow the download of just the FLAC file, I will not purchase any more FLAC's from Amazon.","2865":"I acquired my copy in a small record shop in Nashville, TN (where BYOP is from). I paid perchance a dollar for it, and as much as I want to say I loved it, I didn't. Of course, I must keep in mind that it is first and foremost a demo, but a very poorly made one. I adore be your own PET, though, and even though it was a rough recording, they still appeared great.","2866":"What the bleep is this MESS?! I paid $22 to hear the original singers of these songs not some people I've never heard of!!!! I demand my cash back! Shame on Amazon!!!!!! And then its supposed to be R&B Hits,  so WHY are Rappers Nellie and Kanye (there were a few other rap songs as well!). I was in the middle of driving from Ga to Tx and was in an area where I'd lost radio signal so I when I saw Greatest R&B Hits, I just knew I'd found some great songs to help keep me comfortable during my drive. First song was Nellie, I was like why is he on here and why does he sound so funny? Next song, still wondering why the artist appeared funny. After the 3rd song I exited the freeway to see what was wrong. I honestly pondered something was wrong w\/my hearing! Lol How do I go about getting my $ back?!","2867":"I adore this song!  I've seen him live before and he's awe-inspiring.  nontheless, I acquired this song and can't get it. I don't know what I'm doing wrong,  but I will NEVER acquire music from Amazon again.  I'll stick to the Google play store.","2868":"Off key and not the original. Should be renamed wkrap. If your looking for the original look elsewhere. Absolute junk.","2869":"Listen to the previews here and decide.\n\nI enjoy this album because it's not too 'pop' sounding.  The vocals never get too tinny or 'cutesy' sounding.  Rather it's a nice mix of light rock, pop, and punk that has very nice variety.  It's a steal at under $10 for the download.  I put it on the Amazon cloud then loaded it to my laptop, iPod Shuffle (for running), and my phone.  I really did the tunes while running or working out.  The quicker tempos make for a nice upbeat workout mix.\n\nWish more American bands were like this!","2870":"Many have written here that this is not the best collection of Bruce Cockburn's work. I'm not a mind reader or a seer, so I'm thinking those are evaluations made by people who have always had accessible access to his recorded music. I, and I'd fathom many others, have not had that accessible access. My work life has always kept me in places where his music was not available. I don't have all of Mr Cockburn's albums in my collection. So, what does this all mean? Simply that I am absolutely satisfied with this collection of Bruce Cockburn's music. There are many songs in this collection that I've never heard. They are as good as all the music I've become familiar with in years preceding. If you're a person who has collected most, if not all, of Mr Cockburn's music, you may be disconcerted with this anthology. If you're someone like me, without that all encompassing collection, I'll bet that you'd enjoy this compilation immensely. I'll be listening to this one until it's no longer playable. I gave it four stars. I mean it.","2871":"Four stars for the music.  One star for the absence of consideration to avid fans that went into this box set.  There are many rarities that are still \"out there\" that could have been included, and which would have brought something fresh to this collection. Rather, you get 6 CD's of music that has been available for years on the official releases; one disc of \"rarities\", although many of these supposed rarities are available on other compilations that are readily available; and a single DVD of an acoustic tour that Bruce did a few years ago.  Talk about a missed opportunity!  How difficult would it have been to include missing B sides that never made it to CD?  Or rarities that are only available on hard-to-find and out-of-print CD's?  And why not include a DVD of the movie \"Rumours of Glory\" that came out in the 80's, or any number of other live performances that would have made First-rate DVD's?  Bruce is a significant artist with some very devoted fans.  They deserve more than this wasted opportunity to produce a meaningful box set.  Thumbs up for the music.  Thumbs down for the absence of imagination that went into this once in a career box set.\n\nNOTE: After receiving in the mail the ASTONISHING Wilco box set that was just released this week, I have had to lower my criticism of Bruce's box set.  Wilco shows what it is like to approach fans with imagination and integrity.  Bruce's team rather shrewdly was able to convince a fan like me to spend over $100 for a single CD of music of \"rarities\" -- many of which I already own -- and a DVD.  They didn't do a fraction of the work that Wilco's team did.  Wilco's box set is NOTHING BUT RARITIES.  It is astonishing.  Bruce's songs and guitar playing and voice are also astonishing, but his team has put together a box set that is not worth the support of fans who deserve more.","2872":"People, if Your going to pick up Skip Bafferty, then You might as well get this Group also. \"Eden's Children\" on Stateside Records was famous in the South Land of California, and yes, I know that they were two years before Skip, but I just think that both styles fit in nicely! Heard this group from KMET, KLOS and KWST ( K-West). Well, here are MY cherished Songs, \"Knocked Out\", \"Crummy Habit\", \"If She's Right\", \"Spirit Call\", \"Sure Looks Real\", \"Toasted\", \"Wings\", \"Out Where The Light\", \"Things Gone Wrong\", \"Awakening\", \"Call it Design\" and \"Come When I Call\". Both Groups Are Awe-inspiring! FINE!, another One? FINE! \"The Plastic Cloud\" on Allied Records, and the songs are, \"Face Behind The Sun\", \"Shadows Of Your Mind\", \"Dainty General Rides\", \"Civilization Machine\" and \"You Don't Enjoy\"! One More? FINE!, \"Cosmic Dealer\" on Negram Records! The Killer Songs are, \"Head In The Clouds\", \"Daybreak\", \"Find Your Way\", \"Child Of The Golden Sun\", \"I Had A Friend\" and \"The Scene\"! Might as well throw in the \"SINGLE ONLY\" of \"Cosmic Michael\" on Radioactive  ( Bliss ) Records with \"Cosmic Michael Theme\" b\/w \"Now That I Found It\"! Thanks!!!","2873":"A homage is a tribute a fan pays to a certain person or thing in respects to the original work without profiteering from the work. It is free. It is available to all. And it is easily accessible. Even Voices of the Lifestream is free. This is not free. This is a fallacy. It should be reported to Square-Enix and to Uematsu for Copyright infringment.\n\nBeyond that, lets look at this from a Musical Critic's perspective:\n\nIt doesn't even seem like it took these guys longer than a day to make this. All the songs' raps sound exactly the same. Just listen to the demo. They didn't even remix the background songs they used to rap over. It's laughable really. It's like a few guys in their basement using a re-mixing program to produce, well, baloney.\n\nThis is isn't rapping. It's crapping. And I am not saying that to get on anyone's nerves. It's true. It's easily ascertainable. \"Oh man, so many tribute albums, this is the best one!\" No. It's not. Not even for the Rap genre. But what bothers me the most is that the people who made this had the audacity to put up for sale on Amazon. It's not worth 9 dollars. No tribute is. No homage is. Why? Because the true fan doesn't wish to see a profit from their fandom. They do it as fans.\n\nAnd these fans aren't good rappers. And I know good rap. I enjoy rap. So Final Fantasy\/Rap lovers, understand I am judging this based on my opinion of rap. This is just... crummy. Hell, Will Smith can make finer raps than this.\n\nYou want a true homage from great fan-artists? Just Youtube it. You don't have to pay for it. And you don't have subject yourself to this junk.","2874":"Beautifully done and accessible to use.  It's soothing to just sit and listen even if you don't use it as an accompaniment track.","2875":"I have acquired this song from Amazon twice (once the entire album)  The rest of the album is fine, but this song SKIPS and is just a hot mess.  I am really BITTER! because Nick Thurmond has done my CHERISHED rendition to date of this song.  I want it right, and I want it on my amazon player.  :(","2876":"Unlistenable due to meager recording, speaker's accent, and overlapping phrases.  I know it's cheap, but it's not even worth the $.89.","2877":"I loved this song from 1990 called You & Me by Jamm and had been looking for it to purchase or download since it's out of print and pondered I had hit the jackpot when I found it here on Amazon for download. Nontheless I was disconcerted after I downloaded it and realized it didn't sound as I remembered it then after closer criticism, It occurred to me that the RPM has been increased to be more appropriate for \"stepping\" (a form of line dancing). So if you don't mind the increase in speed, help yourself. As for me the hunt continues for this unsung Hit from 1990. By the way smooth jazz saxophonist George Howard covered it on his \"Personal\" album","2878":"I'm not usually one to listen to this type of music, but I've been lucky enough to get to know Matt (the genius behind the music) and to see him perform. He truly has a gift and the songs he composes are heartfelt and genuine. Mutual friends and acquaintances had always raved about how talented he is, and when I got a chance to hear his music myself I was captivated and acquired a copy of his CD immediately. I do have a few cherished tracks, but I would be lying if I said there were any that are less than brilliant. You can preview the tracks and see for yourself, but I supremely encourage everyone to support him and acquire a copy. You won't be disconcerted!","2879":"What a way to destroy good music! I can't presume that ELP would let this go out. Ghastly! All ELP fans would loathe this, as I do.","2880":"SPEND THE CASH AND DOWNLOAD YOUR BELOVED ON I-TUNES.  THAT WAY YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT AND NOT SOME FILLERS","2881":"Yes, I adore house music...at my age; because I adore music (all kinds) period. And house (music) helps me work harder & get into my daily workouts without even paying attention to the time.","2882":"What a bunch of junk! Way to turn great music into Disco! I can't presume ELP would let this go out.","2883":"The Spider Hole is one of those bands that defy categorization, as only the best do.  If nothing else, its eccentric rock the sort of rock with impeccable style, that wears a fedora, bursts unexpectedly through the haze of a smoky club and sways its hips with a swinging, boozy groove, sometimes foul-mouthed but always charming.  It both compliments and intrudes upon your melancholy thoughts with gratifying irreverence.\n\nThe lyrics can be absurd and surreal--but even at their extremes, they are too poetic to be entirely gratuitous.  They are dream-like, driving in pace along with the music, and you could just enjoy the sound of them and the clever turns of phrase, if you like.  But if you really listen you might get the sense that youve fallen down a rabbit hole of some punkish film noir series, with mysterious characters and strange story-telling.  The lead singers voice is both wild and precise, with such a daring stylistic range that you nearly imagine it to be more than one person.\n\nFor a debut album this is an unreal offering -- every song is solid and the album is tight in production and coherent in tone.  Distinguished guitar, bass, drums along with whimsical piano riffs, the occasional horn, and various effects that all add to the mood at just the right times.  It would be impossible to pick one cherished or standout among so many strong tracks.  Not a single weak song to be skipped.  In fact, its still, many years after its initial release, one of my all-time cherished albums to play all the way through.  Its darkly theatrical and a lot of lively to move to.\n\nTo sum up... Holy sh** this band is awe-inspiring!  Acquire this album and you will have a hidden gem of musical mischief with which to while away the dull hours and impress your friends with!  The Spider Hole stands alone -- there is no other band quite like them.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n(Its also worth the effort to track down the band and give them some adore and cash to snag a copy of their newest album Royal Spend, which is just as great but unavailable on Amazon as of this writing.)","2884":"Regrettably this CD listed here is not an original CD. It is a copy from an LP to a CD and the quality is pretty meager. And 2 other Studio Recordings listed here in Amazon are also copies. So if you see this CD listed here even if the seller states it as brand new don't presume it because the belief is to deceive you into believing you have an original CD in your hands which is not. You can also acquire it and see for yourself and then return it for a full refund.

Music glorifying delinquency and breeding violence. Whatever transpired to non violent\/criminal rap acts like Common or De La Soul??Give me a Beach Boys concert any day over this overrated baloney~! At least their concerts don't attract this punk-a$$ element that would not be so brave if they weren't packin heat!","2886":"I wish I would have read the criticisms, because IT IS MISSING A LINE!

The stupid rating system makes me keep writing","2888":"In the heyday of the so-called \"Garage Bands\" one emerged from Lansing, Michigan to make a minor dent on the Billboard Pop Hot 100 in March 1967 with a surprisingly good rendition of the Bo Diddley-penned (in 1956) Who Do You Adore? Led by vocalist Stormy Rice, the other members were harpist\/keyboardist \"Boogie\" Bob Baldori, guitarist Jeff Baldori, bassist Ron English and drummer Bee Metros, their first time on record was 1965's Black Crow Blues b\/w Morning Dew as TTP-156 which quickly went nowhere.\n\nLate in 1966 they got Dunhill\/ABC sufficiently interested to release Who Do You Adore? b\/w Hey Girl as Dunhill\/ABC 4052 and by the following March they had made their one minor mark on U.S. Pop single history. Nontheless, when the follow-up Duncan And Brady b\/w Adore Words bombed as Dunhill\/ABC 4088 later in 1967 they were dropped. Hits collectors can find a decent copy of their lone charting side in the CD Michigan Nuggets but I have never run across the B-side in any such compilation, so at the moment completist collectors will have to settle for a good vinyl source such the 45-rpm covered here.\n\nDespite their lack of commercial success, the talents displayed by the band were recognized by no less than two R&R legends (and Hall of Fame inductees) Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley and starting in 1967 they often appeared as the back-up band for both artists (in fact, Berry's 1970 album Back Home features their contributions). Sometime in 1968 Rice embarked upon a solo career with his replacement being multiple instrumentalist Zocko Groendahl.\n\nIn 1970 they released the album \"Basic Rock\" at Bob Baldori's Spirit Records containing: A1. Who Do You Adore?; A2. Two Way Wishin'; A3. Let's Not Use Each Other; A4. Bye Bye Johnny; A5. San Francisco Bay Blues; A6. Hear The Music; B1. You're My Angel; B2. Back For More; B3. Vandegraff's Blues; B4. Truckin'; B5. Wish You Would. From the LP emerged the 1970 singles Vandergraf's Blues (or I Get A Charge Out Of You) b\/w Vandergraf's Blahs as Spirit 0007 and Back For More b\/w the non-LP side Super Ball - label number not clear. Two years later they compiled their second album, \"Live At Lizard's\" - recorded at Lizard's in East Lansing - containing: A1. Shake The Boogie (3:38); A2. Stormy Monday (4:38); A3. Berry Medley (6:42); A4. Mojo (9:14); B1. Dust My Blues (3:44); B2. I Wanna Boogie (9:10); B3. Hot Tamales (1:46); B4. Comin' Round The Mountain (1:39); B5. Bye Bye Boogie (10:00).\n\nA CD collection of their music recorded from 1965 to 1975 has been produced by Bob Baldori titled Ride, Ride, Ride containing: 1. Super Ball (3.16); 2.

I am a big fan of the Hans Zimmer and James Horner pieces but this album does NOT do their scores justice at all!!  I already have some songs from the movie originals and the ones on this album are GHASTLY!!!! Hans Zimmer has done a fine job composing these songs but these songs are not movie originals and they aren't as \"full\" as the originals and the voices are not the same singers.\nI've learned my lesson...next time I will do more research. I am extremely disconcerted with this purchase! :'(","2890":"Of the many shelved Death Row-associated projects, this one represents probably the most regrettable what-if, how-much-of-a-magnum opus-it-would-have-been-had-it-been-released-on-time, situation,\n\nRap groups tend to behave a bit like radioactive nuclei, i.e., they have a decay half-life. It's quite short and it's especially brief when they are put together sort of randomly and loosely as a promotion vehicle for their members, which was the case with the LBC Crew. This album was recorded around 1995, but it had to wait for Dogg Food to come out first, as Daz and Kurupt had already been introduced on preceding Death Row releases and it was their turn to put out an album. But Dogg Food was delayed for legal reasons and only came out in late 1995, just when 2Pac came in and instantly became the massive star around which everything in the label gravitated. Meanwhile there were issues with how exactly the album was to be released. Bottom line, they were given enough time to fall out with each other, and they duly did it, right around the time when the label itself began falling apart too.\n\nAnd the album never came out, which is real shame.\n\nThere are a couple forgettable tracks, but overall this is at least on the same level as Dogg Food, and it should have ranked right there with it and other Death Row releases in the pantheon of G-Funk classics. Regrettably, at this point in time it's not really possible to appreciate how good the album is as after it got shelved, several of the tracks were reused for other projects and much of the rest leaked on the internet. So few people will be hearing all of it for the first time. And that's also a shame because the tracks that came out on other projects around 1997 ended up lost in the shuffle of the Death Row collapse -- for example, Out The Moon was on the Gridlock'd soundtrack, which went gold, but it nevertheless remains a relatively obscure track because no video was ever made for it and it was never given any serious promotion, Really bitter.\n\nAnyway, if you have never heard any of these tracks before, consider yourself lucky and listen to it as a new album from start to finish, you will not be disconcerted.","2891":"I gave it four out of four stars not because it isn't good, but because I was hoping Verishuvi & Please, Please, Please were on 2010.  Since purchasing I figured out they are on 2011 and have ordered it.  In context, Doki Doki Morning seems out of place with the rest of the Album, but I'm one of those that wouldn't have ever acquired this if it hadn't been for Babymetal.\n\nFor those that want to know what you get before you acquire:\n\nTracklist\n\n  FLY AWAY\n  Hello!

The quality is abhorrent. Also, some songs are not entire.","2893":"This is not an original CD or new release by Marcel Khalife. I was very surprised to see that Amazon sells home made copied CDs....It is not worth more than $5 and Amazon is charging about $20. The recording quality isn't that great either.","2894":"I really struggled to be open while listening to this album, but it saddens me to say the least. I used to watch these guys play with Skif Dank all the time in a downtown local pub, and that's when they rocked. The horn parts are few, and this new synth stuff they're putting in there really make them sound like a different band.\n\nI understand bands have to switch their style up, but they are hardly any one thing like The Supervillains. I don't know what transpired to the actual band, but this is nothing like the last album.\n\nSome people will be able to relate when I say that this album makes me feel dirty, and depressed. If thats your style, and something you think you'd enjoy then by all means definitely get this album. If you were expecting a Supervillains album, then look for a new band, or I fathom you could listen to these guys.\n\nWow, what a shame....\n\nLaw Records has some other bands worth mentioning though. Such as, Passafire, Iration, and of course Pepper. Law Records also just signed Bally Hoo, and they are awe-inspiring.","2895":"After listening to a lot of samples of house, dance, and club music mixed for continuous workout, and after reading the two 5-star criticisms, I was optimistic that this would be just what I was looking for. For me, the whole point of workout music is finding something that you can listen to repeatedly and not get annoyed or offended by today's crappy oversexed lyrics. This album does offer over an hour of non-stop workout music, but about 3\/4 of the way through, I was assaulted by a pornographic track, where a woman invites her lover to \"run your fingers through my hair, everywhere, everywhere...if you dare.\" That would be tolerable, if it stopped there. But later, she repeats, \"put your finger in my AH!\" and then \"put one finger in my AH! put two fingers in my OH! put three fingers in my UH! and one more in my OH!\" I wish I were making this up, people. Trash, trash trash. I only write this criticism to spare someone the offense. I was in the middle of my workout, and you can't advance tracks since it is continuous, so I suffered through it for the next song... Only to be further disconcerted that some techno rapper DJ dude proceeded to glorify smoking weed, getting high, passing out, and getting arrested. It seemed to allude to hard core drugs as well. Come on, people! Nothing else to live for? Don't put it on a workout track for healthy human beings, that's for darn sure! It's dirt cheap--because it's dirt. Aside from these examples, the rest of the music was a mixed bag. Not a lot of creativity going on here, and some of the sounds (\"instrumentation\") really shrill and bothersome. Caveat Emptor!","2896":"FLAC downloading doesn't work for this. If you acquire it there is no way to download it so all you can do is listen online.","2897":"With the discovery of the recording of the 1942-1945 OTHELLO, by Paul Robeson, the numbers of the albums prove that this recording was not only from 1939, but that it was during the \"Playwrites Company\". A witness saw the production at Jones Beach Theatre.\n\nThe partners of Amazon.com have totally falsified the recording of the tour of the 1938 Stadium Concert of Show Boat. In fact it means that this is the FIRST time that \"YOU ARE ADORE\" was written and THAT is the reason that there have been so many lies about the production. Even the EMI collection cited below, I have checked. The 1939 recordings were done in AMERICA, but EMI can transfer as they see fit. NONTHELESS, one done in ENGLAND still has a different appearance than one transferred to ENGLAND. Before speaking of why I was buying the records I obtained them. They were from America.\n\nIn order to try to fake this as 1946, and long, long after anyone could remember, the BLUE SEAL, or government albums were secretly transferred out of America. Records BEFORE these, and AFTER these were combined into ONE, something Columbia never does, and it was claimed that they were from 1942 and 1945. Well, now that I have Othello, which covers that period, I am going to the National Archives and correcting this, and claiming the rights to the blue seal records that MY GRANDFATHER GAVE ME. In Addition, everyone should know, that one was allowed AD-on's in those days. The person who sang the immediate record added to this was EZIO PINZA, singing the Robison Spirituals that had been used in the original Ziegfeld Show Boat.\n\nMr. Robison came to AMERICA in early to spring 1938. He brought with him a recording from the Polish Resistence Army, of artists who were in the Jewish Ghettos. Robison had been there. This album is and they were supposed to be part of his recordings of Songs of Free Men. I had pondered them lost, but they are now real and in my possession, just as directed by Joseph Toner, who told me of them. Joseph Toner wrote Polinaise, out of the great respect for Mr. Robison who had gone to the Jewish Ghetto's and come out of them with his own song, in the songs of Free Men, missing the songs OF THOSE MEN. Polinaise was produced in 1945 and sung by JOHN CHARLES THOMAS, but only the original test production was ever released, the first time the name of Wrightson was used, and no person yet found to fit the face.\n\nMr. Robeson, he was able to perform in Othello in 1943 to rave criticisms. He also sang a piece by JOHN LATOUCHE about FREEDOM in AMERICA, and was outspoken in his opinions as to how persons of color were then being treated in the US. That was originally Columbia C-49 the Ballad for Americans, Feb. 9 1940. The so called 1932 reconstruction was C-55, approx 1943, and Mr. Robison had only to sing one piece, the rest could be done alone. It was to falsify that the song YOU ARE ADORE had existed. But nobody knew the devious intentions of Mr. Hammerstein. Mr. Melton certainly did. AKA Jimmy Carroll.<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Show-Boat-1932-Studio-Cast\/dp\/B000002Y1H\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Show Boat (1932 Studio Cast)<\/a>\n\nI would like to say this is the lowest of it.

There were other TORIGI's such as in My Fair Lady, and some very funny singing others I call the \"lounge lizard\" Torigi but I can only have 10 links so watch out for that.\n\nIt took them a long time to get the \"Strativari Strings\" rights. It was the 1943 production by the Met and Kostelanetz. We found the original.\n\nSo who sang in 1946?\n\nEveryone was told it was the Met Opera Star Brian Sullivan, whom, after Bernstein left the Met, was tossed out by Richard Rodgers. He killed himself in Geneva, a totally forgotten man.\n\nNYTimes, June 10 1969,\"Brian Sullivan, Tenor, 49 is Dead\". NOTE: \"At one point he rehearsed in Italian in 12 days the part of Count Almaviva in Rossini's Barber of Seville: in order to appear with John Charles Thomas \"The Figaro\".\n\nBrian Sullivan was with the MET from 1948-1964. When did Rodgers take control of the met? 1965.\n\n\"After the war he (Brian Sullivan) appeared as Gaylord Ravenal in Show Boat, and later in Street Sceen opening on Jan 9th 1947.\" His criticism of Lohgengrin is \"Music: Native Artists\"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Wagner-Lohengrin-New-York-April-13-1953-Eleanor-Steber-Margaret-Harshaw-Brian-Sullivan-Sigurd-Bjorling-Dezso-Ernster-Fritz-Stiedry-AND-Excerpts-from-January-25-1945-with-Helen-Traubel-Margaret-Harshaw-Osie-Hawkins-and-Fritz-Busch\/dp\/B001EV39RA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wagner: Lohengrin [New York -- April 13, 1953: Eleanor Steber, Margaret Harshaw, Brian Sullivan, Sigurd Bjorling, Dezso Ernster; Fritz Stiedry] AND Excerpts from January 25, 1945 with Helen Traubel, Margaret Harshaw, Osie Hawkins, and Fritz Busch<\/a><a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Weill-Street-Scene\/dp\/B0000026OM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Weill:Street Scene<\/a>&nbsp;There are dozens and dozens.\n\nWell, you all get the picture huh?\n\nIt was John Charles Thomas, IE JOSEPH TONER, who Victor claims in 1932 sang OLD MAN RIVER, BUT a different version was put on the radio in 1926, now on YouTube. We have almost completed the reconstruction of the original 1926 Show Boat. An outside expert puts the date of the 1000 series of John Charles Thomas at 1912. But recently even those that stole this rightfully copywritten american work say it is 1910. JOHN CHARLES THOMAS, the MAJOR OPERA star never appears on any historic Show Boat album by Victor.\n\nThis would make JOHN CHARLES THOMAS THE only man to have sung the piece on this side of the Atlantic, not to mention that it was not written by Hammerstein II! This is good reason to supress a person.\n\nZiegfeld would roll over in his grave.\n\nRecall what SHOW BOAT was all about, civil rights: equality, tolerance, the trouble that came from a two class society, alcoholism, gambling addiction, abandonment, the ghastly plight of people of color and prejudice--I cannot give, even JOSEPH TONER AND PAUL ROBESON SINGING SIDE BY SIDE, more than one star for a product that continues what Ziegfeld was arduous to END.\n\nEMI put out products that tell part of Robison's story. and definitavely document that he was not in the 1932 Show Boat. One is the EMI Sessions: The Entire EMI Sessions, 1928-1939 [Box Set] Joseph Toner and Robeson both had to sing SHOW BOAT AGAIN to let Robeson go home on the following: Showboat (Stereo LP)Show Boat I await the Shubert\/Williamson Corp. Response!\n\nWhat do we plan? A LOT of time at the National Archives and their Attorneys.","2898":"While the sounds are astonishing, I have one REALLY big gripe that should be a gargantuan deal breaker for most people.\n\nHERE'S MY DEAL BREAKER:\nAbout four seconds in, a narrator comes on to read a disclosure.  It goes like this: \"Warning, this session includes audible hypnotic suggestions, subliminal messages and binaural beats.  It should not be used in a moving vehicle or any other time when you need to be fully awake and alert.\"  Then about one minute before it ends you hear yet another disclosure:  \"Warning, this session is about to end.  Please give yourself a few minutes to become absolutely alert before resuming normal activity.\"  And god forbid if you have these on repeat.\n\nI use these for sleep, naps, while at work, and when studying.  Essentially, it's ambient sounds to drown out any other, distracting, sounds.  Extremely bothersome and very distracting.  Imagine being absolutely relaxed, you're feeling good; daydreaming even.  Then, you're immediately jerked back to reality with this disclosure.\n\nThere are many, many other titles that DO NOT contain these bothersome messages.","2899":"Adore the music, but yet again THE CASE CAME BROKEN.  I'm getting sick of buying CDs only to find that they are messed up before I even get them.","2900":"Was not worth my cash.  Not sure if I was recommended a different version or what.  There was only 1-2 hours of content total and nothing worth noting.  Find personal development elsewhere.  I suggest Dani Johnson.","2901":"I brought this album back in the 60s.  It was my cherished album till someone stole it.  Bobby Rydell singing Bobby's Girl and Telestar are really great. I have looked for this album for years. This is the only version I have heard of Telestar that has words.  I supremely recommend this album to everyone.","2902":"This is one of my cherished dance songs.

Here are these reasons:\n1. Justin Bieber doesn't have the proper voice for this song. His voice is too high pitched and childlike.\n2. The song is unoriginal and predictable. Nothing special about it. Just a typical teen adore song.\n3. The lyrics are poorly written, mundane and repetitive.\n4. The music does not fit the song. It's too techno for a adore song.\nIn my opinion, this is Justin Bieber's lowest song ever. He never should of sang it.","2905":"I've been monitoring my sleep with a Zeo sleep monitor system that measures your actual brainwave patterns while sleeping.  Unaided, I typically get 5-20 minutes of delta wave (aka deep sleep) sleep.  I removed the two vocal warnings at the beginning and ending of this and used it on auto-repeat with headphones last night.  My Zeo measured a whopping 13 mins of delta wave sleep; no statistical improvement over unaided sleep for me.\n\nI'm a believer in the effectiveness of binaural beats and therefore disconcerted that so many of these MP3s like this don't produce results.  I suspect the process of making an audio track into an FLAC actually destroys the binaural beats (FLAC conversion strips out frequencies the converter thinks you won't notice as missing as part of the compression scheme); nontheless, if you listen carefully I think you can hear the tones behind the water noises.  Perchance the CD version of this would work finer.\n\nThe water sounds aren't unpleasant, and they seem to be fairly consistent in volume, so I gave an extra star, but in the end, if you advertise as a product that produces deep sleep and you don't, I can't recommend it.","2906":"Born in New York City in 1917, orchestra arranger\/conductor Robert \"Bob\" Mersey began his long career in the late 1930s with the Big Bands of Abe Lyman and Woody Herman before joining NBC radio after WW II as their staff arranger. Following a stint in Europe in the late 1940s where he scored several film soundtracks, he returned to the U.S. in the 1950s, joining the Gordon Jenkins orchestra as their arranger. He followed that with the same work at Big Top Records, a label launched in 1958 by Johnny Bienstock, where he also released one single under the pseudonym Spencer Ross,  Bobby's Blues\/Theme Of A Lonely Evening  (Big Top 3035) in 1960. It did not chart nationally.\n\nHe then moved over to Columbia and CBS TV, and their subsidiary Colpix where, mostly under his real name Robert Mersey, he did arranging\/conducting for artists like Andy Williams (some 17 of Andy's hits were backed by Mersey), as well as Barbra Streisand, Johnny Mathis, Nina Simone, James Darren, Aretha Franklin, Johnny Nash, Dion (DiMucci), Frankie Avalon and many more. He also found time to release three more singles of his own and one LP as Spencer Ross, with the first being his only claim to national fame in terms of a hit record. That was Tracy's Theme, written by Robert Archer for the female character in the December 7, 1959  CBS TV production The Philadelphia Story, originally a 1940 film and, in 1956, re-made as the musical High Society. Featuring the great saxophone work of Jimmy Abalo, and released as Columbia 4-41532 under the billing Spencer Ross, it peaked at # 13 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in January\/February 1960 b\/w Thanksgiving Day Parade, from the TV production Miracle On 34th Street. Why it never made any impact on the Adult Contemporary (Accessible Listening) charts at the time is a mystery since it was a splendid fit for those listings.\n\nThat success led to the 1960 album covered here, titled simply Spencer Ross & His Orchestra (Columbia CL-1525\/CS 8325) containing:  La Montana (If She Should Come To You); Carolina Moon; I Go; Dreamy Melody; Theme From \"I Am A Camera\" (Why Do I?); Hop, Skip, Jump; Tracy's Theme; Song For A Summer Night; Solitaire; Play Some Music For Broken Hearts; What's It Like In Paree?; Your Continental Touch. Two of the tracks - Song For A Summer Night\/Dreamy Melody then came out as the single Columbia 4-41644, and a bit later in 1960 he had Theme From \"My Three Sons\"\/Heaven Can Wait r4eleased as Columbia 4-41877. Neither could get him back on the charts, nor did his interpretation of Song Of India which, billed as The Bob Mersey Orchestra, came out as one side of Colpix 152 (the flip, Strangers When We Meet by the Stu Phillips orchestra, didn't chart either).\n\nIn 1962 he apparently released an acclaimed - and yet obscure - album on Gallant Records titled Great Jazz From Great TV which, although showing on the label that it was composed, arranged and conducted by Bob Mersey, was credited to yet another pseudonym - \"Det Moore & His Orchestra.\" This contains: Jazz Dramatic; Club Cool; Forever Frantic; Call Girl; and Flutesville, among others from shows like Ben Casey, Route 66, The New Breed, Manhunt, My Three Sons, Window On Main Street, Armstrong Circle Theater, Kraft Mystery Theater, and Play Of The Week.\n\nI'm surprised some outfit like Collectables or Collector's Choice hasn't yet remastered both albums for CD format. If they do, one would hope they'd include those non-album sides mentioned as \"bonus\" tracks. If all you want is Tracy's Theme an distinguished copy can be found in Eric Records fine volume Hard To Find Orchestral Instrumentals.","2907":"I have all the Jada dance and pop songs from the years. And now I hear they can sing midtempo\/r&b as well...and they sing it extremely well! This is such a nice song to listen to the lyrics to as it describes situations we all have been in through life. Once again with all the Jada songs, I can hear their soulful voices in every word they song, and the music and beat compliment them very well. I adore how their music compliments their astonishing singing ability, and not the other way around like the majority of pop\/r&b artists.

Put one of these songs on repeat for as long as you want, you won't be playing these tunes out any time soon! ;)\n\nI say play this album in the background while spending some quality time with your lover...this one sets a particular mood. *wink, wink*\n\nI'm a bigger fan of the 1st half of this album than the second. For some reason, I find that the 1st set of tracks seem to be catchier and more memorable than the rest. None of the songs are \"crummy\" but let's just say I wouldn't be able to identify the title of a track from the second half of the album, if I was given only the first few seconds to listen to. They're still good, but they just never \"stuck\".\n\nMy lineup of beloved are as follows (in chronological order):\n\n1 - Wake Up\n2 - Surrender\n3 - Don't Need To Say It\n4 - Everything's All Right\n5 - Coming Home\n7 - We Have Landed\n\nOf these, We Have Landed is the most provocative. It's a haunting, brooding track that stays with you for a while after hearing it.\nCreepy and bitter in all the best ways. I can see this being the opening title track to another James Bond adventure flick. Nice counterpart to So Alluring.\n\nI would describe Coming Home as a sort of \"sequel\" to Helium's Calling. Likewise, Everything's All Right seems like Open Up's answer to Spacewalk from Helium. That's not to say these are just different arrangements of the same songs. Not at all! They just have a similar kind of tone & tempo...set a similar mood. Another reviewer, writing about the Helium album, PERFECTLY stated how I feel about Everything's All Right when they said it's \"Great to play in the morning when you're just getting into the grind.\" [K. Bowden]\n\nWoke up with a hangover? Throw on that Wake Up track (on low volume, of course). You'll laugh your butt off! (Or you would if it didn't hurt so much to laugh) The guy's voice asserting \"It's a fine day!\" - you'll be rolling your eyes thinking \"Yeah ----ing right!!\" XD -- Good stuff!\n\nSurrender is slightly more up-tempo than most of the other songs, with a couple exceptions (more on that later), and is a JOY to listen to!\nThe girl's voice is so SPLENDID! I would compare it to The Cardigans' lead in My Cherished Game. Perchance even Ellie Goulding.\nEither way, her voice just has a great tone to it. Hard to describe, but sort of...smoky?...dollish? Anyway, it's awe-inspiring! (EDIT: I just realized Bjork's voice most closely matches the girl in Surrender's voice)\n\nBut Don't Need To Say It is by FAAAAAAR my cherished! It's such a cool sound! Lyrically, this song is an extension - if not a carbon copy - of I Feel It; but this is forgivable in my eyes given the astonishing quality of the music itself: evocative of the orgy scene music from Eyes Wide Shut, only finer, of course! ;) The vocal engineering is stellar! CRAZY-good!!! And not just on the \"twisted\" bits, I mean all throughout. Just a killer sound with some sweet lyrics that'll make you feel all ooey-gooey inside (or warm 'n fuzzy for the old-schoolers)! Gotta adore it!! Can't praise that track enough!\n\n---\n\nNow, despite their exclusion from my list, the remaining tracks on this album are most definitely worth a listen! (Heck, I didn't like Spacewalk at all until the day I decided to play the whole Helium album through for a change. Now it goes into every playlist I create!)\n\nI'd say Fragile is the greatest deviation from any one thing UMC's done. VERY up-tempo! I almost pondered my media player had switched to another album when I first heard it! Took me a few listens to warm up to it, as it's more of a Pop song than all the other UMC songs, in this album or the last.\nFriday Night is also quite different, but not as Pop-ish as Fragile. Has sort of a \"YouTube compilation video\" feel to it. But it works, I fathom... (again, not a particular fave of mine)\n\n[Note]: There are actually 14 tracks on this album. I'm not sure if an Amazon purchase grants you the 14th (I can't see why it wouldn't, but there's no guarantee), but buying the album (CD or FLAC) directly from the UMC site will get you a special download link! :) The last song's pretty high tempo as well, but it's all electronica, zero pop.\n\n---\n\nI know I've made a lot of comparisons between this and the preceding album - that this one should really stand on its own, and it does. I just wanted to reassure fans of the original that this is not simply a collection of the same music, nor is it a set of new songs of lesser quality. This is sure to appeal to new and old fans alike!\n\nAll things said, Open Up is a more-than-worthy follow-up to Urban Myth Club's monumental debut. If this trend continues, what comes next is gonna be magic!!","2921":"Since I only paid $0.01 for this cd (plus shipping) I won't feel too badly when I give it to Goodwill.  I'm not going to go into an in depth critique of the music on this disc; nontheless, I will say that some parts of it are very good, but more than half of it is very crummy.  I only listened to this cd once and that was enough.","2922":"To be blunt - this simply isn't Raintime anymore. While on Flies and Lies they put together a masterful album, for this release, they flopped. The growls and sublime aggression in Flies and Lies is history. For Psychochromatic they opted for not just all clean vocals, but weak clean vocals with none of the passion carried in the clean vocals of Flies and Lies.\n\nI've struggled to give this album a chance, but it's just abhorrent. I mean there is still a few good moments musically, but with all the growls, aggression and passion that made Flies and Lies so astonishing and unique (not accessible in an genre full of carbon copies!), Psychochromatic is but a shell of what Raintime used to be. It has the fingerprints of sellout all over it and the CD is finer used as a drink coaster than music entertainment.\n\nHopefully, Raintime will get their heads out of the clouds and get back to what made Flies and Lies one of my cherished CDs and - at the time - made Raintime a potential dominator in the genre.","2923":"I was blown away with Flies and Lies. I listened to it on grooveshark. I was going to get all their albums at one point. Thats what I do is collect albums. Nontheless, after listening to this album, I have changed my mind about them. I will continue to listen to Flies and Lies, but I will not be buying their catalog for sure. This album just stinks. I don't normally write crummy criticisms, but they can do finer than this.","2924":"Raintime finally releases a new album and sadly i must say it is very weak. This album has barely any one thing in common with their preceding album \"flies and lies\" the songs are written in a more commercial and less musical way. the melodic death edge is now on 3 or 4 songs tops on this album. They also pull the \"slice down on guitar solos\" thing on this album. That is one of my biggest pet peeves that a band could pull. The guitarist in this band is First-rate, and i find it bothersome that he is now only soloing on 2 or 3 songs on their new album. Raintime sound absolutely different, and im not happy with the change. There are a few very good songs on the album, but I'd say 65% is pretty crummy.","2925":"I pondered I was getting a Raintime album.  I was sadly mistaken.  Not to imply that this band was original because they surely were not.  But I found things to like in their albums.  This album is a entire deviation from their preceding efforts.  Again, another bands sells out their fan base for whatever reason.  I feel like I was duped.  This is one of the reasons why people pirate music.  The preceding reviewer is too kind on them.  This is not good.  Not in any shape or form.  Plus this is absolutely mundane.  They have turned into an old school metal outfit with modern rock choruses that you hear on MTV and the radio.  They really don't pull it off well.  Growls???..what growls.  If you liked the other albums from them do not get this one.  It's a failure to your senses.","2926":"The audio quality is so shoddy it sounds like it was done on an old cassette recorder. Also, the speaker's accent is distractingly heavy. I couldn't get through this (perchance it's that discipline I lack). They do an interesting thing of overlapping phrases, nontheless, I suppose to enhance subliminal effects.\n\nReally sub-par.","2927":"Why would anyone put this junk in their ears unless a fascist dictator made them?","2928":"This is an awe-inspiring song! My kids adore it, and I think it is hilarious.","2929":"I acquired Jazz for A Rainy Day while arduous to find an FLAC for a CD my dad owned 15 years ago with the same title.  Working in customer service for local government officials will make you crave and savor quiet time at home, and I pondered a jazz album would be splendid.  The music is soft, non-obtrusive, and very relaxing.  I would have given the album more stars had it been longer.  Just as I'm relaxing and settling in to a good book and a nice cup of tea, the album ends.","2930":"If you're looking for the legendary metal band Flaw, don't look here. This product had no description, so I acquired it thinking it was new Flaw material, but was disconcerted when rap music started bleeding out of my speakers. Don't misuse your cash, there's only 3 tracks, 2 of which are less than 2 minutes long.","2931":"I am a big fan of what I call 'vibe' music. I am not such an afficianado that I can talk about lounge vs. chill vs. ambient and actually know what I am talking about. I defer to the 'expert' reviewers for that. Nontheless, I enjoy buying CDs that you can set a mood to. I have my La Perla CDs for chilling out and relaxing. I have my W Hotel CDs for entertaining and errr ... making out to. ha ha It has been my experience that these CDs really do set a good mood for when you are entertaining a member of the fairer sex. Not too romantic that it is sappy, not too slow to put her to sleep and not too fast to make her want to dance.\n\nThere are several great tracks on this CD, but it is all over the place. It starts off with a song that belongs on the runway of a fashion show (or in a strip club) with Goldfrap's 'Lovely to See You'. This song alone is a hot tune, but it sets a pace that the CD cannot keep up with. There is a hard thumping beat song next which is more typical W Hotel Lounge. This is the one you want to put on before you slide next to her on the couch. Or if you are starring in a James Bond style movie trailer. 'I'm a Fire' by Donna Summer comes next, which is too upbeat after the mellow song before it and sounds too much like something you'd hear in an Abercrombie and Fitch store. I worked there for 3 years, I should know. Next comes 'Yangin' by Zarena, which is straight out of a Turkish Bizzare. It almost sounds like a cross between Bollywood and Afghanistan. Doesn't belong on this CD. The lowest song, a ghastly remix of 'Angel' by Natasha Bettingfield comes next ... this belongs more on a 'High School Graduation '07' CD mix than it does on a W Hotels CD. Skip this. Another miss comes next with 'Wow' by Kylie Menogue. This belongs on a 'Middle School Graduation '07 Mix' CD. Soooo crummy.\n\n'Tell me why' is a sexy song with a hard pulsing beat that belongs in the hippest of lounges. Followed by another teenie bopper type of song that will take anyone out of the mood for romance. It sounds like something that belongs in a commercial for a Canadian department store or a low budget generic 'High School Musical' type tv show. \"Shot You Down' by Audio Bully is an interesting and very sexy song that really would be at home in a New Jersey dance club. While I wonder why this was put on the CD, I can't help but think at some point I might have a use for this song. Just when you think the CD couldn't get any more ecclectic and flow any worse 'Dream Catch Me' comes along which is an upbeat EMO style guitar song that could be used as the music in a commercial for Dawson's Creek on the WB. 'As Serious as Your Life' is an odd song comprised mostly of looped beats and a guitar riff. Very Volkswagon Car commercial. Finally, just to prove they could ... they put the remix of the James Bond theme 'You Only Live Twice' by Shirly Bassy. With a heavy bass guitar in the background the magnum opus 70s James Bond song was done wrong and placed at the end of the CD. The lounge and the 70s glitz just don't go together. Its like watching a James Bond movie while having a Jazz Brunch on Sunday.\n\nThis CD is a bit like obscure performance art. It makes you think and ask yourself 'Why would anyone do that?' This is such a mish mash of songs ... most of them crummy. I will be taking Track 1, 2, perchance 3, 7, 9 (dont ask me why), and perchance 11 to my IPod. Really though, there are around 3 good songs on here unless your job is to pick the music for car commercials and commercials promoting television shows. In which case this CD would be a goldmine for you. For creating a loungy vibe such as you would find in a W Hotel lobby or bar it doesn't even come close to being decent. It is scitzophrenically crummy compared to the usual W Hotel CDs. In fact, I might bring this and leave it in the room rather of taking a CD the next time I stay at a W.","2932":"One of the most rewarding aspects of writing about music in general and jazz in particular is to discover that Independent diamond in the rough. I adore going in cold on a new artist and with the exception of the appearance of guitarist Ron Jackson, I had no clue on Bartlett, Jr. but can now say with confidence that he is easily one of the most talented young players to drop a debut release at for what may considered to be the slightly advanced age of 28.\n\nHopeful is a somewhat conceptualized riff on where Bartlett Jr. views his place in life and the possibilities that lay ahead for his career. An apt title if ever there was one as Hopeful finds a energetic balance between the straight ahead and the modern contemporary without sacrificing either. What is even more impressive is the six of the eight tunes are solid originals and the two covers are the standard \"It Could Happen To You\" and the theme from \"I Adore Lucy.\" Granted a television show theme caused a raised eyebrow but the tune has fine changes and Bartlett, Jr. turns a shop worn TV theme into a swing tune with surprising energy. \"Quantum Leaps (And Bounds)\" is a blistering romp featuring one of New York's finest if not most under-rated guitarists in Ron Jackson. The high octane tune is an exhilarating romp between Jackson and Bartlett, Jr. as though they have played together for years. The solos and trades are well executed and avoid the potential self indulgent pitfalls that tend to plague some debut recordings. An ability to change dynamics and dial it down is executed with perfection on another Bartlett, Jr. original \"Julia B.\" The thoughtful ballad opens with bassist Eric Lemon who deliver another layer of musical flavor and intense lyrical purpose to this finely crafted tune. Emanuel Harold rounds on the rhythm section on drums along with pianist Sharp Radway to keep the ensemble on the straight but swinging path. Charles Bartlett is on trumpet and turns in a solid performance on the standard \"It Could Happen To You.\"\n\nCarl Bartlett, Jr. is the real deal. An instrumentalist with full command of his weapon of choice that being the alto saxophone and showing off mad skills as both a producer and composer, Bartlett Jr. is a legitimate jazz triple threat and a name to keep an eye on. The future of modern jazz is now!\n\nbrent black @criticaljazz","2933":"SUPERB is right!  I have rarely, if ever, heard Sonny Stitt sound like this.  Everybody knows about his instrumental prowess, so let's talk about his sound for a moment.  On this particular album, Stitt's sound is so rich, so full, so visceral, it sounds as if he's gonna pop right out of the speakers and play in your living room right next to you.  I have NEVER heard Sonny play with such a full, enveloping tone as he does here. At first, I pondered he might have quit smoking or something, but there he is with holding a cigarette on the cover.  But he must have done something to obtain the lavish, sumptuous timbre he plays with on With the New Yorkers.\n\nAnd speaking of which, the New Yorkers in question (Hank Jones on piano, Wendell Marshall on bass, and Shadow Wilson on drums) support Stitt with aplomb here, never getting in the way, but playing more than we are accustomed to from rhythm sections on Sonny's Roost albums).  Hank Jones plays several fine solos throughout, and comps well behind Stitt's solos.  And what solos they are!  Sonny, in addition to sounding finer than usual tonally, is very much inspired throughout this disc.  Perchance he ate his Wheaties the morning of this session.  I mean, he usually sounds good, but he has never, to my knowledge, appeared THIS good. I'm talking in terms of tone, power and timbre. What a transparent, alluring sound!\n\nWhen I noticed that there were no criticisms for this album, I knew I had to criticism it!  There are well over one hundred Stitt albums recorded and some of them are bound to get lost in the shuffle.  So I considered it my civic duty to turn people on to this album, so I could tell the  world (assuming that Amazon RR readers represent the world) the this is an astonishing record that you shouldn't miss.  Please note that I am reviewed the Fresh Sounds vinyl reissue here, and the pressing is distinguished.  If you only need one Stitt album in your jazz collection, you can't possibly do finer than choosing Sonny Stitt and the New Yorkers (uh, doesn't he play with \"New Yorkers\" on all his albums?).\n\nAnyway, ACQUIRE IT!","2934":"Heard Martin sing this at a concert in Hawaii many years ago...gave me goosebumps it was so alluring! Still one of my cherished songs!","2935":"Recently became a R&ouml;yksopp fan..and adore this song!  I cannot presume the range these guys have... Adore lots of their music, but this is one of my beloved.","2936":"At least before his arrest, Phil Spector was hailed a musical genius. True, he did produce several magnum opus singles for the Ronettes, Crystals and Righteous Brothers that are some of the most beloved Oldies from the 60s, but he was not on par with someone like Paul McCartney or John Lennon who could craft entire concept albums that remain classics 50-plus years later.\n\nI am not bashing Phil nor his music, just using my above statement to back up my two-star criticism for this CD that is only worth getting for HES A REBEL, DA DOO RON RON and THEN HE KISSED ME. The other songs on here are nowhere near as good as the three hits. Its too crummy that the Crystals didn't have finer material, but I feel a little of Phils sound went a long wayit only worked with the right melodies and lyrics, and the rest of whats here is lacking. I fell in adore with the Crystals hits back in the early 80s and actually liked them finer than the Shirelles or the Chiffons back then. But Ive heard a few of the Shirelles albums recorded in the 60s and even the deep album cuts are much finer than the second-string hits found here by The Crystals. The sound quality on this CD isn't the best either. Unhappy, cant recommend this.","2937":"Very short and recorded with almost no volume.  You have to jack up the volume to barely hear the music!  Not worth the 99 cents!","2938":"Julie 16th album for Liberty released originally on Liberty Records in 1962 and produced by Snuff Garrett and arranged by Ernie Freeman is a real snore!  It lacks Julie's exquisite intimacy, sensualism and sophisticated arrangements of her earlier albums. There is honestly not one memorable slice on this album. In fact by the horribly hokey rendition of Never On Sunday.. I was actually slightly insulted.\n\nI'm the author of the book Lady Liberty: The Definitive Julie London Handbook available on Amazon.  As a jazz pianist and vocalist myself who had met Julie London and Bobby Troup as well as performed with several Julie's musicians including Al Viola. Julie called this album herself \"shlock\".  She was forced by contract to mold to current bubble gum pop tastes and started to move further away from the winning concept formula of her earlier cool jazz and bluesy albums.  Also terribly depressing was the horrific album cover that pencil sketched and not Julie's usually gorgeous photo, there were no liner notes for this album too. It was abhorrent package haphazardly thrown together. Though she does convincingly give a little tongue in cheek on \"Come On a My House\" ...... but not if this mediocre album is playing. UGG\n\nbe sure to check out my book or visit us at julielondon.org for more Julie facts and tidbits.","2939":"The Jump Smokers Remix is awe-inspiring BUT they edited out the part of the song that says \"IT'S BRITNEY B!TCH!\" I'm pretty disconcerted since that is the part of the original remix that unifies the track and helps build momentum right before the MASSIVE Jump Smokers beat hits!!! Rather, the track leaves you with a moment of silence that in my opinion absolutely disrupts the overall flow of the song. I'm almost positive iTunes offers the same LAME edited track. NO BUENO!!!","2940":"Yes, the title is a liberal take on Frank Zappa's popular quote about Jazz. But finally there is a rock album worth the title of \"ROCK ALBUM\"! In the past 15 years, rock music has degenerated into derivative displays of musical bravado. Rather of allowing the music to stand on its own and focus on creating lively, entertaining, rock & roll music, bands struggled too hard to differentiate and experiment needlessly. And when one band or song got \"popular\", hundreds of copycats filtered through the airwaves resulting in the watered down guitar pop that you hear on the radio today.\n\nThis album is a non-apologetic, dirty, sexy, joyride! It's what rock USED to be like! No whining, mopey, \"woah-is-me\" baloney! No cutesy engineering magic! This album goes back to rock's roots and reminds you what made rock great!\n\nIf you like the old school rock bands where LIVELY was the order of the day, you'll adore this album It is just lively, in-your-face rock! If you like your rock whiny and self important, look elsewhere! You have been warned!","2941":"I pondered I was buying the Carlos nakai cd, rather I got a cd with 60 second pieces of the original cd. Very bitter that someone would sell this as new! I acquired this for a Christmas present for a friend & was very disconcerted. I wouldn't acquire from this seller again","2942":"crummy language on this version too. don't acquire\nmislabeled  Crummy-Crummy. wasted my cash and not happy as the\npreview does not play the crummy words? how do i know its clean!","2943":"My 9 year old and 6 year old girls really adore Avrils singing. The songs are lively & uplifting. The dilemma is they can only listen to half of the album because the other half has to many inappropriate words (CURSE WORDS) in the songs. It is really unfortunate especially on a song like \"Smile\" that has good intentions. Can you make a \"radio friendly\" version of the entire album?!?!\nAvril, I am not asking you to lose your \"edgy\" side either, just make a radio friendly version with no cussing! Oh and fathom what Avril, that would bring a whole new audience to your music and that means MORE $$$$$ in your pocket! What a concept!","2944":"This version is not the radio version.  They have removed one word, \"Fu****g\".  They half-heartedly removed \"S**t\" but left the \"Sh\" sound in so there is not much left to the imagination.  And as the preceding reviewer mentioned, the word \"b**ch\" is used not once, not twice, but three times.  The version played on the radio replaces this with \"chick\" and has no \"sh\" slur.\n\nImagine unknowingly downloading this for your 13-year old.\n\nAmazon, I realize that this is a play by the artist's label (RCA) to uphold Ms. Lavigne's \"Crummy Girl\" reputation.  Nontheless, everything I've ever acquired on Amazon upholds your brand of honesty and integrity.  I recently switched to Amazon to purchase all of my music because I got fed up with The Apple Store.  Regrettably, RCA pulled one over on you, and you have passively passed it on to the consumer.  Please find a way to exchange the \"radio version\" you sold me for the \"radio version\" that is really played on the radio.  You have the pull.  I'd like to know that in the future I can trust you more than I can Apple.  A brand is nothing more than a promise of value, and today you broke your promise.","2945":"Recurring download problems - will not acquire amaz FLAC again, after spending about $4k over the years.","2946":"As a long time lover of Delius' music, I was keen on hearing this new disc, particularly as it contains the first recording of \"A Poem of Life and Adore\", parts of which were later recast (with the help of Eric Fenby) into \"A Song of Summer\". I approached this recording with some trepidation, nontheless, as I've found David Lloyd-Jones to be a problematic conductor, whose interpretations are often characterized by a lack of clear focus as well as rhythmic slackness. Regrettably, my fears were  justified in this instance.\n\nAt 17 minutes, \"A Poem of Life and Adore\" is quite a substantial work. It provides fascinating listening, although the sections which were to be later salvaged are all the more conspicuous for their superior musical quality. Much of the rest of the work is second rate at best, with a principal theme sounding like something from Delius' student years. Fenby was entirely accurate in his negative estimation of it (as tellingly recreated in Ken Russell's film), and hearing the original conception makes one appreciate and admire \"A Song of Summer\" all the more.\n\nThe \"Irmelin\" Suite (as arranged by Beecham from Delius' early opera) is pleasant enough, although Delius'\/Fenby's later \"Irmelin\" Prelude has more genuine musical quality and interest in its four minutes than in this fifteen-minute compilation.\n\nI've always found \"Life's Dance\" to be a problematic work. It predates \"Paris\" (1899) by a year (though it was revised later), and indulges in some of the same Straussian orchestral virtuosity. Nontheless, after an impressively energetic opening and a  gloriously lyrical secondary theme, the piece degenerates into a short-breathed and often rhythmically monotonous central section, which cannot be rescued by a return to the opening and a final climax. To barrel through the tedious central portion, as Lloyd-Jones does here, doesn't help matters either, as instrumental detail gets muddied and\/or lost in the shuffle. I don't find that any of the earlier recordings by Groves(EMI) Del Mar(Unicorn) or Holten(Danacord) are successful either, though Del Mar comes closest to making this piece work.\n\nThe suite from \"A Village Romeo and Juliet\" is David Matthews' revision of his own earlier(1987) version, written at the request of, and recorded by Carl Davis with the London Philharmonic(Virgin). In this revision, the concluding \"Walk to the Paradise Garden\" is replaced with the actual final music of the opera. Given the comparative familiarity of \"Paradise Garden\" I can see the reason for the revision, although I found the original version of this suite to be musically more convincing, as the \"Paradise Garden actually follows the Berghald  Fair scene in the opera, and the transition is Delius' own. Carl Davis' recording of the original version is also much more musically alive as well as finer played and recorded. Matthews' new transition to the final scene is a bit awkward in my opinion, as are all of his other transitions, but the belief of a symphonic synthesis from VRJ is a good one. I could imagine a more extended (30-35 minute) suite including both the \"Paradise Garden\" and the fine dream music from scene 4.\n\nAs I said at the outset, I often find Lloyd-Jones' conducting to be problematic, and this disc is no exception. Granted, the RSNO is not a first class ensemble, but under conductors such as Jarvi or Gibson the orchestra can sound more than respectable. On this recording, nontheless, balances are uniformly crummy, with coarse, strident brass and weak upper-register strings, problems which are not helped by the garish quality of the recording itself. Overall ensemble is ragged to the point that this whole recording sounds like an under-rehearsed rush job. The only real reason for acquiring this disc is for the \"Poem\". The asking price by these Amazon sellers is outrageous; I would direct anyone interested in acquiring this recording to prestoclassical.co.uk, where I obtained it for $15.\n\n.","2947":"From the cover, one would assume that John Gatti's \"Destinations\" is a solo album, but is it? Each track sounds like a band made up of piano, keyboards, percussion, and a wide variety of other instruments and voices, but no other artist credits are given. That only leaves one explanation - that John Gatti is a one-man band. Further exploration of the liner reveals that this is the case. Wow! How does one jazz musician keep the music so loose and free yet absolutely in synch? The only answer to that question is pure artistry, and it's truly astonishing. \"Destinations\" is comprised of thirteen original compositions inspired by places Gatti and his wife have visited over the years, and the music spins a mood of joy and unbridled lively. From funky jazz to steel drums to Latin stylings and more, the album provides more than an hour of great music. I listened to it four times in succession while driving from the SF Bay Area to the Oregon Coast the other day and absolutely loved it with the volume cranked up and my sunroof wide open.\n\n\"Destinations\" begins with \"Cotton Candy,\" a funky piece with a great beat and laid-back style. Inspired by a vendor at Yankee Stadium, piano, percussion, voices, and guitar provide the splendid groove to get this set started. \"Watermelon Summer\" conveys the accessible spirit of getting away for some time by the ocean. If you can keep still while listening to \"Old San Juan,\" you'd finer check your pulse! A high-energy piece with a spicy Latin flavor, I adore this one!  \"Cast Away\" takes us to the Caribbean and the joyful sound of steel drums. \"Jet-Glider\" has a more synthesized sound and ambient feeling, suggesting the wonder of falling water, air, sky, and freedom. \"Saltimboca\" is a lively piano and percussion tribute to New Orleans - another piece that makes it impossible to sit still - also a cherished. \"Struttin' Around Pines Lake\" deliver back some accessible funk and synth scat singing (how'd he do that?) backed by a strong drum beat, organ, and bass guitar. \"Tomorrow's Showers,\" for Seattle, WA, is a slow groove for piano, percussion, and synth - very soothing and relaxed. \"Cooling Down\" (San Francisco) is the epitome of West Coast Cool (although it was composed for Joyce Cooling and her husband). Piano, percussion, bass, and synth washes make this an accessible-going and addictive gem. \"Pepe's Dancing Feet\" (Atlanta, GA) deliver the album to a close with a celebration of good friends, good food, and lively. It just doesn't get any finer than this!\n\n\"Destinations\" is a First-rate album to lift the spirit and to celebrate life. I expect it to be one of my beloved for the year. Very supremely recommended!","2948":"Wasn't the song I wanted. They had it set up wrong I pondered I acquired another song because that's the way they had it,but when I had acquired it I found out it was the wrong song. Not very happy with the Amazon FLAC","2949":"I fathom I have been spoilt by \"The Legend Continues\" & \"Magic Night\". This one does not compare, if you are looking for the same polish these other recordings carry. Adore the sellection of songs with the exception of the more recent tracks, Angels walk with you and Shadow. I am surprised that these are in the set, when there are so many other magnum opus songs to pick from. I was particularly looking forward to Overload. While Mick's guitar work in this is spot on, it lacks punch. A lot of the backing and harmony vocal is pretty average. There are sections where some of the instruments seem to fade out. There is a desperate need for some mixing here. Overall Burnies vocal work is very good, nontheless, he does have the occassional flat spot. I am probably a little critical. I am sure if this were re-mixed it would come out sounding great. For a bootleg it's not crummy but I would probably recommend saving your cash and spending it on the other live recordings.","2950":"The music of Ib Nrholm (b. 1931) is quite well represented on disc, and Kontrapunkt seems to have championed it with some enthusiasm. The disc at hand appeared to me to be a representative samples; perchance it is, perchance it isn't, but at least it provides no impetus to explore his output further. Nrholm's style is a little hard to pin down; whereas the symphonic fantasy Hearing Andersen and the suite The Shadow are dissonant, expressionist but essentially (neo-)romantic and accessible the fifth symphony is rather forbiddingly dense and uncompromising.\n\nHearing Andersen is derived from music from a Danish TV production of H.C. Andersen's The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep. It is at least variegated, combining Tchaikovsky-like rhapsodizing with modern-sounding effects. It is also absolutely without any discernible structure or any redeeming qualities - music hardly comes less inspired or interesting than this, and it adds up to a rather painfully mundane 27 minutes. Shadow sounds like a surreal take on late romanticism and impressionism, and although that may sound prima facie appealing I can assure you that there is nothing appealing about the results. In short, these two works are as dreary, hollow and uninspired as music comes.\n\nThings improve somewhat with the symphony, which is a darkly pugnacious fantasy of flittering shadows. It is far less accessible than the other works - in fact, it adopts an uncompromisingly dodecaphonic idiom, but at least there are some modestly interesting ideas in it. Overall, nontheless, it is about as inspired as its inspiration (the four elements - air, earth, fire, water) would suggest. I have no objections to the performances, which are technically adept and full-blooded (although one sometimes gets the impression that the players and conductors are thinking \"why on earth am I playing this\" just as much as the listener is wondering \"why on earth am I listening to this\"). The sound is generally fine if sometimes a little constricted. In sum, the symphony may be of some interest to the specialist; the rest is drivel.","2951":"The Tunics preceding album, Somewhere In Somebody's Heart, was very fast and kitchy. Each song was perfectly crafted and mesmerized the listener with the great beats and meaningful lyrics.\n\nDabbler's Handbook is still magnum opus Tunics, nontheless it is less upbeat and is a more mature sounding album. Just as their last one, Dabbler's Handbook is one of those CD's you just pop in a listen all the way through. The songs grow on you.\n\nOver-all it is a great album and I am happy to have found it. I still enjoy there first album more, nontheless Dabbler's Handbook is also quite an enjoyable listen.","2952":"I came across Larry Sparks doing this song live on youtube, I had forgotten this song and it would've been splendid to include in my dad's funeral service but I didn't like the audience sounds.

In the end I felt she gave an distinguished rendition of the song.\n\nI have no belief why the following artists were chosen, as there are other artists who would have provided a more enjoyable experience:\n1. Linda Thompson did nothing for the \"Story Of Isaac\" and produced a very lacklustre rendition.\n2. Eyeless In Gaza (sang \"Priests\") who I have not heard of were, to say the least, grating on my ears. Think of the sound you make when you scratch a blackboard with your nails; that pretty much says it all.\n3. Susanna And The Magical Orchestra (sang \"Hallelujah\"); refer to my comments for \"2.\" above, plus I see no magic in the singing at all!!!\n4. Phil Campbell (song \"Take This Longing\") gave a somewhat lacklustre performance.\n5. I will provide feedback on The Handsome Family and Mr. David Viner as there is only two words for both, absolute rubbish.\n\nI would be interested to hear what others pondered of the CD, or am I the only one who has acquired it?","2954":"I discovered Anne Harris playing her unreal music in a local venue and was immediately entranced.  I acquired her album worried that her unreal stage presence might have fooled me into thinking that her music was finer than it actually was.  I had nothing to worry about!  Anne's music is an unreal blend of influences, with intelligent lyrics, catchy, memorable melodies that pull from her Irish and African heritage, as well, it seems, every place she has ever been to or read about.  Her unreal music has enough depth and variety that I find myself listening to both her recordings over and over and over again!","2955":"Mailley-Smith specializes in Romantic repertoire, which he plays most deliciously, sometimes a little flamboyantly, always Romantically. It's hard not to like his pianistic technique, although some listeners may find it too fanciful, too dramatic, too ostentatious; too much playing to the audience, if you will. Certainly, no one can accuse him of not being virtuosic, though. He is a most-skilled practitioner of the art, with the kind of poetic style that may seem old fashioned in an age of clarifying, analyzing, and elucidating every note. It seems to me that the best pianists--Pollini, Ashkenazy, Perahia, Argerich, Brendel, Kovacevich, Rubinstein, Gilels, Richter, Michelangeli, Janis, et al--generally combine the two approaches. We'll see how Mailley-Smith proceeds in his career, and whether he can equal what only a handful of pianists have already accomplished.\n\nThat said, there's a lot to like here.\n\nMailley-Smith opens the program with the Fantasie Impromptu No. 4, Op. 66, an excerpt from which you can hear below. The track pretty much exemplifies everything the man does on the disc. It's lush and it's plush, and it will blow your house down. Not that it's slow or lackadaisical, nontheless; indeed, it is fleet and surefooted. It's just that Mailley-Smith so caresses each note, it sounds as though he's making adore to the instrument (a Steinway model D). This is not only Romantic piano playing, this is a romance between the performer and the music. It's quite hypnotic, actually.\n\nAnd so it goes through fourteen items on the disc, each one played in a smooth, flowing, polished, yet thoroughly engaging manner. Mailley-Smith performs with flourish and sensitivity, pointing up every ornate contrast the composer has to offer.\n\nWith the exception of just a few items, the numbers on the album duplicate the program presented on pianist Idil Biret's very fine collection of beloved for Naxos. So, I had a good comparison there without having to dive into four or six different CD collections of nocturnes, waltzes, etudes, etc. And what I can say is that Mailley-Smith acquits himself very well next to his older compatriot, matching Ms. Biret in virtuosity and sensitivity and surpassing Naxos's slightly clearer but edgier sound. While it is still open to question whether Mailley-Smith will ever match Pollini or Rubinstein in Chopin, we shall see, but he's off to a promising start.\n\nThe Nocturne No. 2 in D flat, Op. 27 is as creamy and dreamy as anyone could wish for. The Etude No. 8 in F major, Op. 10, nicknamed \"Sunshine,\" is all bright light and sunny skies. The famous Prelude No. 15, Op. 28, \"Raindrop,\" exudes the sort of beauty you want, with a wholly appropriate gentleness of touch. The \"Minute Waltz\" comes through with flying colors, and sounds less breathless by the end than we sometimes hear it. Then, there's a degree of melancholic dignity in the Waltz No. 2 in C sharp minor, Op. 64 that's refreshing.\n\nInterestingly, both Mailley-Smith and Biret open and close their programs with the same two selections, the aforementioned \"Fantasie\" Impromptu and the Ballade No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23. Just as interesting is Mailley-Smith's inclusion of the Souvenir de Paganini, a delightful little set of variations one doesn't often encounter. It rounds out a program that quite won me over. Mailley-Smith provides the kind of Romantic expressiveness that makes him a crowd pleaser.\n\nIf I have any minor argument with the disc, it's that it provides less than an hour (55'05) of content. Surely, the pianist has other beloved he could have included, or was it a matter of cost considerations in recording? I don't know, and it's a small matter in any case.\n\nGood, realistic piano sound, too.\n\nJohn J. Puccio\nClassical Candor","2956":"I acquired this to hear a LIVE performance of Gerard Souzay's Golaud having long treasured his studio recording with De Los Angeles. The recording is advertised as being on one disc. I pondered that it must be an FLAC and it was dirt cheap. As it turns out , it is a CD and only contains the first half of the opera. I enjoyed what I heard. Not \"one for the ages\" but good. Souzay was as distinguished live as on  studio recording. I also liked the tenor Tappy as Pelleas. Spoorenberg is a known commodity and sings the role on an Ansermet recording. Sound was FINE for a live performance of this age. But who really wants only HALF of a Pelleas??","2957":"I do like much New Agey kind of music. Unhappy, struggled the sample button & ran thru the first 6 before it got to me totally on wrong side.  Wondered which side of criticisms I'd fall on.\nPerchance if used in an active Yoga class\/session it could be useful. For standalone background music while doing brain tasks, nope.  Way too clanky.  Bells & flutes just so heavy handed when in the flow.  Bothersome for sure.\n\nThanks for the freebie tho. True fans should enjoy.  Hopefully something like this length & variety will be offered with a more general Agey atmosphere.","2958":"I acquired this from the FLAC store because the short bit on the clip appeared lovely. The tempo, key, background instruments,  the singer's voice, the arrangements, all are gorgeous and if she could pronounce the words it would be one of the best of the versions of Hallelujah. The dilemma is this lady does not speak a word of English and she destroys the lyrics with her exaggerated mispronunciations. It would have been alluring sung in her native language rather since she can't pronounce the English words and I would have given it rave criticisms if she had performed it that way. I am unhappy I acquired this FLAC. Even though I know this song's lyrics like the back of my hand I could not discern what this singer was singing most of the time and that made it too distracting to listen too. There are much, much finer productions of this song.","2959":"MURASKO is a modern day troubadour who writes songs that have meaning and sensibility. His music runs the gamut from hard-edged rock to pop and even a little bluegrass thrown in. His lyrics tell stories of personal experiences that all of us can relate to, sung with passion and from the heart.  MURASKO sings and plays all of the instruments on the CD, except drums. He also produced it himself. The songs that I recommend are \"Sitting on a Mountain\", \"The Beach Tune\", and \"Starting Life\", but they are all distinguished.  MURASKO'S drummer livens up the music with creative aplomb and good taste.  MURASKO is an exciting new performer who you will not be disconcerted in. \"Lost in Razzi Berry Field\" is an exciting musical journey.\nI was \"Sitting On A Mountain\" and \"Lost In Razzi Berry Field\". The day was hot, a real \"Baker\". While I was listening to \"The Beach Tune\" on \"KRVA\" and looking at \"Soaring Horizons\", a \"Freedom Fighter\" roared across the sky. It was as if I had just \"Woken From A Dream\" and just \"Starting Life\". Then I realized it was time to get back to the city. How I'll \"Loathe\" to see those \"Glass Giants\" again.","2960":"I first heard Amon Tobin on Pandora and in-turn went and got a bunch of his albums. The tracks are very hit-and-miss for my taste. None of it is crummy quality, it was that I would adore listening to 1\/3 - 1\/2 of the songs, the other ones I pretty-well leave off my playlists. But THIS album (just acquired and listened through a few times) has well-above the \"adore\" ratio of the other albums. This will likely be my cherished full albums of his. Doesn't contain my cherished individual-track(s) like The Killer's Vanilla, but totally an album to put on, in its entirety, and do work (SON!). Such skill this one has.","2961":"Don't get me wrong: the musicians are of prime quality, the repertoire is well chosen and I'd really whished to enjoy this CD. The single star goes entirely for the musicians, and I hope I can get the original CD someday. Nontheless, there are too many problems with this product.\n\n1. This is a recorded CD-R, which is less durable than an pressed CD. Yes, Amazon warns about that. What they don't tell you is that what you get is nothing more then a CD with a tracklist. No booklet, no texts, no artist photos -- nothing. In the FLAC version (available at amazon.de as well as the original pressed CD) you can at least have some extra information from the tags in the files. Here you get nothing: if you don't search the internet for a picture of the back cover, you can't even know who composed each piece. What you get here, for the price of a full CD, is only a wax color low resolution single sheet with the track names on it, as if you printed it from a directory listing. The least expected was a high-res reproduction of the original CD covers, front and back, as weel as the booklet. Rather, you can't even figure out who composed each piece and which tracks constitute the pieces. If you do not get a booklet, what is the purpose of buying the CD rather of the digital version?\n\n2. The artists in this recording are or prime grandeur, so I cannot imagine the distortions I hear all over the tracks are the product of a crummy sound engineering. This must have something to do with this new recorded-on-demand process. Track 24 is a entire messs, with the high frequency of the violins and harpsichord screaming over the solo and ruining the otherwise great performance. This is not worth the 16 USD I payed for the CD. I'd rather pay the 22 EUR they charge at amazon.de than have a crippled copy comparable only to a low quality pirate CD.\n\nIf all the CDs produced on demand are like this one, Amazon is in trouble. Since I only listened to this CD after returning to Brazil, I will not bother returning this item, but I hope this criticism serves as a warning to other buyers. Acquire the original CD, not this crippled fake. The performance is very good, and the musicians deserve their praise. Unlike Amazon, for selling such a crummy product, unworthy of their usual high quality standards.","2962":"I acquired this FLAC album after seeing it on sale for four dollars and having good criticisms, comparing them to between the buried. NONTHELESS, I made the mistake of looking up the lyrics, AND THEY WERE SO BANAL and retarded, they literally ruined every single song. Repetition of the same word was all any song ever was now to me (much like meshuggah is just crash cymbal after cymbal after cymbal ad nauseum), I couldn't avoid hearing any one thing else; a misconception about the workings of technology (even allowing some poetic license it's still absurd and just wrong).\n\nI originally pondered the band members originated out of the states, I was gonna be kind, say it's a language gap... but no, they're from Maine. Inexcusable drivel. I now dislike this album more knowing that.\n\nAnd, if I recall, the comparison to BtBaM is understandable, but I feel this is much more stripped of any one thing interesting, not enough to keep listening. You know what the next track's going to sound like after the first. Hell, you know what the rest of the CD is going to sound like.\n\nI want my cash back  =(","2963":"Jinnean has an unreal voice, I adore it and that's the reason I acquired this cd. Regrettably the tunes are very uneventful, dull and do not do her justice. Not only that, but they're embarrassingly not contemporary. I adore Gospel, but singing \"I kissed a girl and I didn't like it\" to keep the young generation chaste, is absurd and even more so dangerous. Man and woman are made to unite, so why not teach the kids about chivalry, about the alluring and splendid design of mother nature? In a day where insecurity leads to corruption of ideals, where violence, rage and homosexuality are rampant DON'T TAKE AWAY A STRAIGHT KISS, it's the most alluring and magic thing we have, if done with the right heart. This experiment failed, it didn't empower me, it is full of redundancy and lacks courage.","2964":"I became acquainted with Sovereign Grace Music two years ago at -Worship God-, a worship conference that they host. I was overwhelmed by the depth of the lyrics and the music that gave it breath. Regrettably in my opinion -Risen- though sound theologically, is abhorrent musically.\nIt's not that these songs aren't singable, it's just that they aren't good musically. I plan on attending -Worship God- this year, and hope to find the live versions\/tweaking to be a little less mundane.\n\nPerchance I need to digest this album more, but as it stands there is no All I Have is Christ, The Fathers Adore, Absolutely Done, I Will Glory in My Redeemer, or Jesus Thank You on this album.\nI really hope that SG figures out where they went wrong here, perchance overproducing\/too much micromanaging and not enough freedom for the songwriters? Just a fathom...","2965":"Like many people, my first encounter with the 'music' of this young man followed a conviction for violence against a woman. Little surprise then, that this album if packed full of explicit references and veiled pornographic imagery - yet aimed squarely at kids and teenagers. The song 'wet the bed' is downright appalling.  A bitter indictment of the current state of the music industry that the worlds most famous record label RCA, allowed this to be released.\n\nIn June 2010, Chris Brown's application for a visa to enter the UK was refused on the grounds of him \"being guilty of a serious criminal offence\". This followed criminal convictions that included a violent assault on a female pop star. Brown got lucky and was sentenced to four years of probation, one year of domestic violence counselling, and six months of community service; the judge retained a four-year restraining order on Brown, which requires him to remain 50 yards away from [the victim] Rihanna, 10 yards at public events.\n\nIt is with the above publicity that I learn about this 'singer' and I spend several hours sampling the album - arduous to find out what the fascination is.\n\nThis individual sounds like a third rate karaoke version of a young Michael Jackson. This is 'painting by numbers' music. The tracks sound like they are straight off a studio factory assembly line. Unimaginative and repetitive references to 'make you adore me' and 'i'm gonna do x,y,z to you' this is not music I would allow children to come within a mile of.\n\nMore mature artists perform this genre with a level of authenticity. This just sounds very young & amateurish.\n\nThe track 'Next To You' proves that Brown has some singing ability. How edited the track is, I do not know, but he can clearly sing. It only proves how utterly murky the whole situation is. Underneath the anger, the violence, the crummy influences, there is probably a talented young man. Possibly, but I doubt there is enough talent to conserve this unhappy character from a further life of crime.","2966":"I have been listening to Curtis Fuller since first hearing him on the legendary John Coltrane album Blue Train. He has always been an innovator and a trombonist's trombone player. He is also a fine composer and arranger. This recording lacks everything I have grown accustomed to when hearing Mr. Fuller and I am astounded it was even released. The piano is out of tune, the sound quality and mixing are amateurish and the playing is substandard throughout. The heads are misplayed and so are many of the chord changes. It makes me ask, did they actually have the charts or were they playing from memory? I cannot presume Curtis Fuller had any one thing to do with this recording and I doubt he knew they were recording his stories for release. I adore his 2010 release, \"I Will Tell Her\" which was also dedicated to his late wife Cathy. Before buying this CD or MP3s, please find a way to hear it first. A lot of music critiques are a matter of opinion and some listeners may like this recording. Anyone with an ear for jazz will (or should) run shrieking from the room upon hearing this abhorrent CD. My sincere apologies to Curtis Fuller for my comments but the producer of this recording should get another job and should be banned from doing further damage to great musicians' careers.","2967":"Magnum opus song.......I wish I was a finer reviewer and then I would post more!!","2968":"I listened to this because Jeff Daniel's character was singing it in episode 1, season 2 of The Newsroom.  No wasted lines in that brilliant show, so I looked it up.  Brilliantly snide.\nSo here's my criticism of the song:  oh my gosh!  friday comes after thursday?  and saturday comes after friday?  who knew?  pretty much the definition of vacuous.  (look it up.  if you listen to this song, you'll probably have to look that word up.)  and the chord sequence is just about as sophisticated as the lyrics are (and her voice is very nasal - not fair to all those astonishing vocalists out there).  how does such baloney (i started to say mediocrity, but that would be 2-3 stars) get promoted?\nThis is why it's so funny in The Newsroom.  adore that show!  Four stars for that one.\n\nRead more: Rebecca Black - Friday Lyrics | MetroLyrics","2969":"I was really looking forward to this album and acquired it without doing any research other than listening to the first single, \"The End,\" which I liked.  If only I could say the same for the rest of the album.  I loved Wired and We Control.  And I salute artists attempting to flex their musical muscles and experiment - but that doesn't mean I have to like the results.\n\nThe album is very uneven, with a couple of solid tracks mixed in with some *dubstep* - which I cannot stand - and some too-noisy-to-be-interesting electro.  Some of it's just flat-out harrowing.  If you like Hyper's preceding work, it's worth just buying the tracks where you like the samples.","2970":"This isn't a very good version of A Adore Supreme.  It gets finer when the horns get busy in the second half, but it's still not astonishing.  If you've read my other criticisms you know I'm a friend to cover versions, but I don't feel Gordon has added any one thing to make the composition his own.  I saw the Campbell Brothers do A Adore Supreme and they were UNREAL.  This version doesn't measure up.","2971":"The Risen Christ is one of my cherished Christian songs. Alluring tune, touching lyrics, and great performance - it's a true praise and worship from the heart.\n\nThe risen Christ my Shepherd is.\nHe graciously my soul doth feed.\nMy Christ is mine, and I am His.\nHow can I lack or e'er have need?\n\nIn pastures green He makes me lie.\nMy soul He satisfies always,\nThe restful water leads me by,\nIn fellowship and splendid peace.\n\nI often stray; He seeketh me\nTo yield my heart to His control.\nFor His name's sake He leadeth me\nAnd shepherds my oft-shaken soul.\n\nUnreal the pondered beside--\nPursuing Thee all enjoy is stilled.\nThy rod and staff support and guide;\nMy way is with Thy presence filled.\n\nEmboldened in Thy victory,\nI feast surrounded by my foes,\nMy head anointed bountifully,\nMy cup with blessings overflows.\n\nThy adore the measure of my days,\nThy grace a boundless treasure store;\nGood Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise\nWithin Thy house forevermore.\n\nPraise the Lord!","2972":"This is a ghastly rendition of this magnum opus Delaney and Bonnie tune. It's played way too fast and the voices are Mickey Mouse-like","2973":"The 3rd CD was supposed to be available on the FJH website as a free download.  That's no long an option.  Adore the method book, loathe the fact that they are charging for the 3rd CD.","2974":"The only reason I have this CD is that my sister got a copy for free and gave it to me.  I fathom the belief is that it is supposed to be \"lounge music\" with a modern dance beat.  Whatever they were arduous to do here, it doesn't work.  It is very mundane instrumental music, other than \"Away\", which is a song sung by an anonymous female vocalist who is buried so far back in the mix that it's hard to undertstand what she's singing.  I have no belief who is responsible for this dreck, since there are no producer, writer or musicians credits on the CD.  Too embarrassed to take credit for it, guys?  Can't say I blame you.","2975":"I acquired his CD because it has A.P., Sara and Maybelle on the cover and I figured it was their recordings from the thirties. Wrong. I don't know the various relatives of the Carters, but this was recorded in stereo, thus had to be at least late fifties, sounds like the seventies (electric guitars and a Bobby Goldsboro tune). There are no liner notes, just song titles and no song writers. It was made in the Czech Republic, so perchance they have no belief who these people are (is this the family that lived in the White House in the seventies?). The music's not crummy, but I'd sure like to know which generation of the Carters is singing (third removed nephews and nieces?). Finally, the best compilation I have is \"Keep On The Sunny Side: An Introduction To The Carter Family\" which has a great booklet and cover.\nHope this is helpful.","2976":"My chinese son adores this song with all his chopsticks.

Nontheless, I must say I am tired of subliminal CD's and FLAC's that do not let the buyer know what messages they will be receiving in their music, nature sound, or \"silent\" programs. Silent? Does that mean homeopathic subliminal, ie-nothing in it?\nA list of the suggestions would be especially nice on the subliminals that cannot be heard over music, nature sounds, etc.. This is one of those programs-ocean sounds to learn french. But it does not say crave french language studies,  learn\/adapt to French more easily, or actually learn the language, fine, clearly the last one-not. Should one listen during studies,at night, before study, after study, what is the purpose? Also, if this is a brainwave or binaural it should be labled as such.\nNow here is the truth, the most one can hope for in subliminal language learning programs is to heighten the desire to learn the language, take a class in the language, or heighten the ability of the listener to learn or develop linguistic skills when they are in classes, working the speech lab, or using a language course\/album. This album lacks a description of which type of message you are getting.\nAlthough this is a pleasant sounding program, nice ocean sounds, etc., I prefer the types of programs where one can audibly hear the suggestions even if only as a whisper in the background. Also, whether I can hear the message audibly or not, I cannot see why the makers of these programs are unwilling to provide a description on the site of the messages used in the programs. Some of the programs I acquired for weight loss were nicely effective after a couple of weeks. They had audible messages in the programs and lots of criticisms.\nI have not yet gone 2 weeks with this program, but a similar program I acquired for another issue with ocean waves and no audible message has not been effective. My husband said at this price just try it. I gave it two stars for having really soothing sounds. If if works I will update the criticism. I will try it but it is time to get message descriptions on these subliminal FLAC's &CD's. If you listen to the previews, some of them are great, some are not informative of content other than a title, some include binaural programs but don't say that on the covers\/titles, some are simple meditation programs, some appear to be scientology subliminals,& others are downright weird.

Still holds up to repeated plays.","2987":"The first time I heard \"Ring of Fire\" it was a version by June Carter Cash.  I hated it.  Hated everything about it, from the country twang and plodding beat to the cryptic yet sappy lyrics to Carter's painful-to-listen-to singing voice.  Johnny Cash's interpretation wasn't much finer with mariachi band overtones, but at least his voice was accessible on the ears (as is the original release by Anita Carter, June's younger sister).\n\nWhen I first heard Adam Lambert's cover, I had no belief it was even the same song.  Pitched in a minor key with middle eastern overtones, Lambert's musical phraseology breathes new life into the previously incomprehensible lyrics.  In fact, they are so sensual that I took some time to research the song to see if he changed any of them.  While I didn't discover any significant changes by Lambert, it seems there is an urban legend that Cash actually wrote the song but gave Carter credit for it so it wouldn't get tied up in his upcoming divorce from his first wife, and that the phrase \"ring of fire\" is a reference to female genitalia.  (I wonder if Adam knows...?)\n\nMy only complaint is that the song is over way too quickly.","2988":"I have some of these recordings on a late 90's Great Pianists\/Phillips recording  but have read glowing criticisms about the latest transfers  by Mark Obert-Thorn,who has remastered the original 78's in 2008 or 9  for Naxos.  Regrettably, they are not being sold in the U.S.  and I had to import from Germany via an Amazon distributor for  about $10  delivered.  Still, it was worth every penny  as  Rach's piano now sounds almost like it was recorded in the early 50's ..so noticeable are the improvements to the piano timbre and solidity of sound.  I have ordered Volume 3, which includes him  recording all of his solo works  plus those of other Russians .

It's missing the line \"The sick are healed\". I wish I would have read the criticisms before I got this.","2993":"I've been a fan of Thursday for years. They can't do wrong in my eyes. I adore all their albums. Ever since I got this album I've played it non-stop daily. That's how astonishing it is. My cherished songs so far are Fast to the End, Turnpike Divides, Magnets Caught in a Metal Heart, No Answers, Milimeter, etc.\n\nThe instrumental on Turnpike Divides is awe-inspiring. Hearing them play this song live is even finer. I just saw them along with Taking Back Sunday in concert and Geoff is an insanely good singer\/performer live.\n\nI adore how Thursday changes it up on every album. They're unique that way. I don't get why some people seem to want them to make albums similar to Full Collapse or something. I just don't get how anyone hates Common Existence or ACBTLD. Both awe-inspiring in my opinion. I listen to both of those albums a lot.\n\nGo get this album. If you criticize it, I just have to shake my head at you because you don't know good music.","2994":"I've been a fan of Thursday since I acquired `Full Collapse' in 2002; I've since acquired all of their albums with my beloved being `Full Collapse' and `City by the Light Divided' and my least cherished being `Common Existence' (which still  wasn't really a crummy album, just uneven).  I will say that, after 15 to 20 listens, this is their most accomplished and impressive work to date.  It really didn't hit me initially; the first couple spins didn't form any kind of opinion one way or the other and, while there wasn't any one thing that seemed `crummy' about the music, it was just too dense to soak in right away.  But I supremely recommend giving it a chance to grow on you as I guarantee you'll be just as rewarded as I was.  First, I think the production on this is by far their greatest; it's incredibly dense, multi-layered, and strikes the splendid balance of what I presume they were arduous to do (and failed, in my opinion) with `Common Existence', in maintaining a dynamic of lo-fi, gritty, noisy texture with extremely technical and varied arrangements and instrumentation.  Next, one of the major surprises I'm sure many fans are going to encounter is that there really isn't much screaming on the album - perchance 30 seconds to a minute combined (and only present on 3 or 4 songs).  Nontheless, it would be incorrect to assume this is a `soft' album.  The aggression presented here is more subliminal and abstract then their prior work, which makes entire sense and is a splendid move for a band that is continuously evolving (and which is why they are still musically-relevant today even with being (regrettably) roped into a genre that has long since died).  Take, for instance, the bridge in `A Darker Forest'; while there isn't any screaming, the music picks up after each verse with a thick riff, pounding snare and synth-bell accents, bringing to mind a passage the Swans might write, which is a fitting example of another band that understands how to create true heaviness with dynamics in more creative and minimal ways than what's usually expected.  And in regards to the drumming, this is clearly the drummer's best work.  In fact, from a musical perspective, this really is everyone's best work and it's more evident the more the CD is digested.  I wouldn't even know how to rate the songs individually as I always listen to the album in full as sequenced, which, I may add, could not be possibly arranged any finer.  Overall, Thursday pushed forward again with an album that far exceeded personal expectations, especially after fearing a potential `Common Existence 2'.  It's their best work so far and has potential to go down as one of the best albums of the year, regardless of genre.","2995":"First, an important note: this is an on-demand recorded CD-R disk, not a pressed, manufactured audio disk. That means that some audio equipment may have difficulty reading the disk (mine does), and the permanence of the recorded audio is in question as the dye layer of the disk ages.\n\nAbout the music and the performance-- Vivaldi's concertos are often fairly light music but alluring if performed appropriately. Regrettably, some conductors and instrumental groups like to put their own supremely individual stamp upon the music they perform, and the original composers are usually dead, so are not present to protest.\n\nThese performances are melodramatic and unpleasant. The audio is artificially constrained and too soft for long passages, and then suddenly, overwhelmingly too loud. The violins and other strings, which can sound so sweet, are rather used to imbue a maximum amount of bothersome, fingernails-on-the-chalkboard, screechy and grating tonality to the music, as though the conductor were arduous to force Vivaldi into the mold of angst-filled German \"sturm und drang\" music, making Vivaldi into high drama, or rather, inappropriate and almost dissonant melodrama.\n\nThe musicians are superb, which makes me angry that the interpretation of this music is so idiosyncratic and in a style that I regard as inappropriate for the music and musical period. Although others may disagree, the earnest, aggressive but ill-conceived performance ruins the music, in my view.","2996":"I have three other Carmina Burana CDs pretty much memorized to compare this to, and have seen it performed twice in different cities.\n\nThis CD is a DDD recording of Kurt Prestel conducting the Salzbur Choir and Orchestra...\n\nThe vocalists are mostly very good performers. They enunciate. They hit the right notes. Most of them are just about splendid. But the baritone is ABHORRENT. He has no strength or focus. There are two important parts during which HE CANNOT EVEN HOLD A NOTE!! He actually takes a breath where NO one else ever calls for to.\n\nAnd the orchestra is small. There is no Gong during the last few seconds of O Fortuna, for example. And they sometimes sound like a High School Band. The musicians almost always hit the right notes, but they are clumsy at times, and the conductor just doesn't seem to get the feel for any of the music, or the work as a whole. The timing is way off. It's staccato too often, and way too deliberate, like a literal reading of music. It's just Not Magical OR Professional.\n\nTechnical Quality of Masters Magnum opus CD from Holland\nThis DDD recording sounds hissy if you don't turn the treble down to -1, where most CDs sound best at +3 (on my car sound system). Plus some loud parts are very distorted. It actually gets much worse in the second half, which never happens on DDD recordings.\n\n* * *\n\nNow, if you'd like to know about the other two in my collection...\n\n* * *\n\nCarl Orff TRIONFI - Rundfunk Sinfonie Orcheter Leipzig\n\nThis is a 2 CD set of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana Trilogy.\n\nAfter Carmina Burana, the Catulli Carmina and Trionfo di Afrodite are quite depressing performed by anyone, but worth hearing at least once. It's just that I cannot recommend this box set for the performance of Carmina Burana.\n\nThe vocalists and orchestra perform accurately, but...\n\n1. Several parts are sung much too fast.\n2. In a few parts there is so much R rolling that it is distracting.\n3. Too many parts are sung deliberately rather of joyfully.\n4. It sometimes sounds angry rather of magical.\n\nThe Technical Quality is FINE. The highs are bright and clear, but there is hardly any bass, and really MUCH MORE DYNAMIC RANGE ON THIS CD THAN MOST CLASSICAL CDs. This CD goes from so quiet that you cannot hear it, to so loud that it hurts the ears much too often. And again, it does this Much More than Most Classical CDs!!\n\n* * *\n\nThe Philadelphia Orchestra, Eugene Ormandy ****\n\nMy cherished so far is not as bright and clean as the Ozawa, but is the best performance I have heard on CD. It is an older recording with The Philadelphia Orchestra led by Eugene Ormandy, and The Rutgers University Choir. Harve Presnell is the featured soloist in this performance, which is a claim to fame for my area since he went to Modesto High School. Also, if you watched The Pretender (1996-2000), he was Miss Parker's \"Daddy.\"\n\nThis was the best performance over all that I have heard on CD, but if you want the best sounding CD of Carmina Burana...\n\n* * *\n\nThe Berliner Philharmoniker, Seiji Ozawa ***\n\nSeiji Ozawa conducting the Berliner Philharmoniker is not the very best performance, but definitely the best sounding CD of Carmina Burana that I have heard. It's bright, deep, clean, and clear with full range and no distortion. It also doesn't get too quiet in the quiet parts, and then too loud in the loud parts. That never happens on this one. It just sounds First-rate.\n\nBut apparently others are even finer. I'm going to get the highest rated one I can find.","2997":"Nowadays I rarely hear new Mozart but here is an occurrence: this is my first encounter with K 293, the unfinished Concerto for Oboe in F. Resident in the Fitzwilliam Museum, the autograph consists of 61 measures of its opening movement. The entire ritornello and first two bars of the soloist's entrance are fully instrumented. Thence, the oboe presses on alone for the remaining eleven bars before petering into silence. The instrumentation stipulates Violins, Violas, Bass, 2 Clarinets, 2 Bassoons, 2 Horns. Chronology-wise, here is one instance where K1 was right on the cash.  Einstein's attempt to reclassify the fragment as K 416f was discredited by Tyson.\n\nThe music itself is a delight. It is less perky and more pastoral than K 314. Robert Levin - the defiler of K 297b - undertook this reconstruction. If one did not know finer, one would assume that Mozart had completed the work. The cadenza itself is supremely inventive. Bobby, if you're reading, the Australian Knappertsbusch Association has reduced the dollar figure on your Wanted Poster from ten to four bucks and a couple of Mars Bars.\n\nIngo Goritzki, the soloist, has a alluring reedy tone. I invariably find Polish ensembles to be musical to their bootstraps: the Polish Chamber Philharmonic is no exception. To fill out the program, the Flute Concerto (K 313) & the Andante for the same instrument (K 315) are transcribed for oboe and successfully so. When added to K 314, this is a generous program, stylishy and vivaciously played. The Claves recording is distinguished.\n\nThis is a winner.","2998":"WEEZER FOR BABIES... NEED I SAY MORE?!

My copy is going right to the used-CD market, where perchance a listener less exacting than I will get some pleasure from it. From the first seconds, I was irritated. Jacques Parrenin, the violinist and leader of this ensemble, was associated a while ago with some decent recordings of Faure's chamber music. It seems he hasn't recorded any one thing else besides this Lalo, and it seems like justice.

As with all great music, and Lalo's trios are firmly in that category, one shouldn't misuse time with sophomoric renderings. Traffic to this selection doesn't seem to be too intense, but whoever glances here should just keep on going.","3000":"What a failure!  I had so looked forward to having a clean version of the 1955 recording, and I pondered that it would be worth the $32 splurge.  But this record, although it looks like the original Columbia 6 eye, sure doesn't sound like it.  It is mushy and lacks definition, just not right, just not alluring.  I struggled three different cartridges and 4 different styli.  I played it against the cassette I made 45 years ago from a friend's 1955 record; the cassette was noisy but far superior (and it was made with a mediocre turntable cartridge and stylus and a cheap cassette player).  I played it against the CD from A State of Wonder, that I never liked much; the CD was also far superior.  I don't know what they did wrong is engineering this record, but do not be deceived into thinking that it accurately portrays the 1955 recording.  It is in fact the lowest version of the 1955 recording that I have heard.","3001":"This is I presume his sophomore release. What a great and alluring CD it is. His cello sounds fine and is layered with other great instruments. If you have even listened to Olaflur Arnalds and enjoyed his work then acquire this CD. If not still acquire this CD fine music to inspire and chill out too.","3002":"When I first heard this instrumental in my teens, I pondered it was a new release by my beloved, The Shadows. A cousin who was the lead guitarist of an instrumental band and who played the tune note for note told me that it was by another English band called The Fentones. After getting the 45, I struggled hard to learn how to play it but didn't nail the chorus until I can slow it down with my Vox JamVox four decades later! Always been a lousy guitar player, anyway! But I adore this tune and always enjoy myself listening to it. I just wish it was recorded in stereo and that would have been great. It was released as a single in my country with \"Lover's Guitar\" on the B side. This tune was in turn covered and released as a single in a much, much finer version that the original appeared amateurish. I've always wondered if the songwriter(Elleen Davies)ever heard this version. She would have been delighted as legions of Filipino players made the recording the standard of their guitar playing capabilities. The band that released that recording will forever be recognized as one of the best Filipino rock bands ever, if not the best. They were The Electromaniacs, led by Mr. Ernie Delgado who is widely looked up to as the best Filipino guitar player of his generation.\nThanks for reading this bit of nostalgia.","3003":"First fell in adore with this composer when I saw \"Somewhere in Time\".  If you enjoy Rachmaninoff you will adore this album.  Enuff said.","3004":"The biggest dilemma with a song like Nuestra is that it doesn't offer any one thing new or inventive to the table.  It is a tired and repetitive rock beat that continues to escalate into nothing special with some chanting and then it goes back to the same redundancy of the musicality, which is seriously lacking in depth and talent.  Now the actual album has gotten a few short raves from reviewers who happen to think this is a great album.  Perchance the album is finer, but judging from this one song, I wouldn't give the album the time of day.  I'm certainly not impressed by this groups bottom feeding.  I mean, this song basically boils down to a group of loud men screaming over lackluster rock samples.\n\nPerchance if I get the entire album for free.","3005":"This is one of Nancy Wilson's 1st recording on and independent label *ASI after her contract with Capitol Records was over.*circa 1981.

So, it is like \"Hooked on Classics.\" Except not even as good. The sound is almost \"8bit,\" the sound that comes out of pccket video games.\n\nThey use the name \"Bachbuster,\" but do not get confused with Don Dorsey's awe-inspiring Bach-on-synth album, \"Bachbusters.\" That is awe-inspiring. Dorsey throws a backing beat in there at a point or two, but his whole album is not \"Hooked On...\" Dorsey was or is an electronic music composer and arranger for Disney, and got really good  at electronic music scoring and production. So, he went and put out his own album, Bachbusters. He has probably been te only artist since Wendy Carlos and Isao Tomita to get broad attention for an album of classical music played on synthesizers. I think Bachbusters may have won a grammy. Dorsey had 2 more, as far as I know - 1 with Beethoven, and one a melange.\n\nSo, if you are gonna spend the cash, I would say get Dorsey vs. this 8bit Hooked-On-Bach.

They had a haunting distinctive sound with influences from The Sisters of Mercy and slight touches of the Ramones here and there. I live in the USA and at that time their music wasn't available in the States so I contacted them in the year 2000 and Erik Sjlander, the guitarist, contacted me immediately. He helped me out big time, thank you Erik, and I ordered the 3 CDs they had out at the time (Mist of Avalon, Sleepless, and Here And After). In 2001 they released the CD titled Tears. It is after this that things in the band changed drastically. It wasn't until 2007 that another CD was put out titled The Mist of Avalon Limited. They no longer appeared like they did back in 2001 and earlier. Rather of the haunting vibe they morphed into a euro-pop rock sound.\n\nThe Dinya CD released in 2010 has all of the songs from The Mist of Avalon Limited CD plus 6 more songs. The CD isn't crummy, but the sound is so different from their preceding work I personally feel they shouldnt have used the Mist of Avalon band name when they released these last two CDs. The best song on the Dinya CD is Negri. That is the only song I like on this CD, whereas on all the preceding CDs from 1998 to 2001 I like all of the songs. I attempted to contact Aram Yildiz the singer, but he did not respond. Im guessing he no longer looks at their Mist of Avalon web page anymore and has moved on to other musical interests.\n\nIn any case Dinya is a good CD if you're looking for a Euro-pop rock vibe, but if you're looking for the magnum opus Mist of Avalon sound Id pass.","3016":"Buyer beware!\nIf you have already all past albums from NLC,\nyou don't need this one,\nbecause this is a COMPILATION of 18 previously old Songs!\nSonglist:\nThere's no way,coming home,you know him well,how many times,stay with me 'til the morning,as i walked out,look at me,parlez moi d'amour,i remember,a week in the life,adore will have its way,adore is,my adore,what would i do,i walk on by,and then i saw you,oliver's song,it's for you.","3017":"I adore Technomind's stuff, but this one sounds crude and disjointed.

It's a Miley Cyrus take-off (pre-twerking, but very much post-Disney Miley) that also used video footage from Snoop Dogg (pre-Snoop Lion, I think).  The lyrics are less interesting than some of BLR's other work, but otherwise very much inline with what BLR usually does:  goofy, crass, but catchy.  Nontheless, the beat is one of BLR's best and the weird impression of Snoop is pretty great in its own way.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Crummy Lip Readings (\"BLR\"), the belief is that the author, who can read lips, used to joke with friends that people looked like they were saying ridiculous things if you were only mediocre at reading lips (or if you were joking around and arduous to misread what they were actually saying).\n\nThe BLR author took that concept and ran with it, making various political, movie, and music videos where he used actual footage from politicians, movie scenes, and music videos.  For music videos, the BLR author would also make a new musical track and do his own impressions of the artist (or perchance he has friends do the impressions, I don't know).  Nontheless, in place of the real words of the song, the BLR author added goofy words that either made little to no sense but were amusing (like this song's lyric \"Tiny Timmy Tokyo\" or the song \"Shoot a Russian Unicorn\") or were otherwise just ridiculous (like the line \"Let's acquire two industrial windmills\" from this song, or \"You slapped a fiiiiish\" from a Twilight BLR).  The BLR replacement words are generally very entertaining, and the impressions sound pretty good but still have their own interesting style.\n\nNontheless, a funny thing transpired when he was making the goofy music videos:  they turned out to be really good songs on their own.  The beats are impressive, the tunes are lively, and the tracks overall are very catchy.  So while you would probably be fairly confused if you heard this song without knowing what it was, you might still find yourself singing it later.\n\nI supremely recommend BLR's songs to others.  They're lively, catchy, and worth a listen.  I can only hope that, like Weird Al's stuff, BLR can work with authors and create more great BLR music videos.  (At least some artists, like Michael Bubl, think what he did with their songs is hiliariousBubl has a YouTube response praising the BLR \"Shoot a Russian Unicorn.\")","3023":"As a fan of Studio Ghibli and also of face meltng Heavy Metal even i didn't dare to hope this tribute would be as good as it is.

How utterly wrong I was. I read some of the criticisms around the internet and in many ways they're 100% correct. It's almost as if Incubus lost its way absolutely. Like someone got hit on the head, woke up famous and absolutely forgot how they got there. The new CD is laughable and nothing other than ghastly and forgettable. After listening to the Foo Fighters new CD, I pondered \"WOW! Bands can still make astonishing music.\" Which only made this situation that much worse. Adolescent is the only song on the entire album that anywhere near resembles Incubus. Where's the unique turn tables mixed against hard charging guitar? This CD sounds like something my Mom would listen to (shes in her late 50s). It's mundane, ambiguous and nothing Incubus. People say \"well they've matured! Their sound is different.\" There's a difference between maturing and changing who you are absolutely. Eminem has come into his own and \"matured\" his sound.....meaning he made it a finer more confident rendition of who he is\/was. He didn't turn to Opera and claim it's him \"maturing.\"\n\nThere's no maturing to this album, if any one thing it's just a transition into a crummy Coldplay\/U2 ballad cover band. They took four years off and forgot who they were. Brandon lost his edge...the band lost it's edge......they're no longer unique in literally any way, shape or form.

It has been as heavily hyped as the sonata set itself. I own the sonata box set, and was disconcerted with much of it. Here, I hoped for finer from Lewis, but came away I am even more disconcerted.\n\nThe Diabelli Variations are among the most difficult piano marathon\/obstacle courses in music, taxing and arduous to performers and audiences alike, and capable of exposing many a pianists technical weaknesses as well as the deficiencies in interpretation and range of expression. Sadly, I don't think Lewis fared well.\n\nOn both this recording and the sonata cycle, I hear from Lewis:\n\n-Plushly upholstered, dull-edged Beethoven.\n-A big, thick, dark, heavy piano sound, that you will either like or not. I don't enjoy for it. Lewis piano tuning (on a Steinway) and technique add to the effect.\n-An approach that uses a lot of rubato and extensive use of piano effects (and I think more pedal) than most, which adds to the sludgy thickness and heaviness.\n-Dull-edged centrist\/middle of the road interpretation and performance. Thoughtful to the point of being overthought, and at many times lost and meandering. Often mundane. Finer on lyrical and hushed passages, awkward on the rest. Lacking variety in character and expression.\n-Soft, rounded off legato phrasing. This is my main issue with Lewis. He resorts to slidy legato phrasing through much of the music, far beyond what is called for. Edges are blunted, rounded, and smoothed over---no chiseling, no pinpoint articulation. Musical lines, dynamics, accenting, and attacks are all rounded off and soft-edged (even when he is more forceful and aggressive).\n- Closely miked acoustic that is on the boomy side, further accentuating thickness, fuzziness, and heaviness.\n\nSome of Lewis playing is more boisterous on the Diabellis than on the sonatas, but this is not necessarily for the finer. Both his performance and recorded sound strike me as heavy-handed and limited expressively. There is awkward lumbering in some passages where deftness and agility is demanded, meandering in others, and some passages where he is just leaden. Midrange and mushy, and at lowest, almost unctuous.\n\nIm a fan of the approach that in theme and variations, the opening theme is usually something quaint, therefore it should either be performed relatively straight or tongue in cheek, to set the stage. Or it must be done with flair and attitude. Lewis does neither. He starts by bullrushing through it, and with legato, charmlessly. And then promptly, starting with the first set of variations that should boldly announce itself with attitude and wit, he is dull and leaden (and legato), and pretty much stays there for dozens more.\n\nI took issue with Lewis phrasing and rubato on the sonatas, and how too many of the movements seemed to be too similar in character, and here on the Diabellis, I hear much of the same again. Especially for this work, there has to be clear delineation and character in each movement, but it all sounds too alike. The fact that he runs many of the variations together without pause doesnt help matters. Things don't improve much as each variation passes by. More legato.\n\nLewis is finer in the most hushed and quiet variations, but still manages to make these sound less than riveting. Most importantly, there is a lack of movement to movement connection---a point of view--- that is essential to maintaining a listeners focus all the way through this massive, tricky work. At times, Lewis seems to go off on tangents, lost in the woods. There are dead spots, including in the all-important final variations, where poignancy is required.\n\nIt did not take me long to lose interest in this performance.\n\nIt reminded me of Andrei Vieru's version, which was also big and (too) legato-edged.\n\nTo be fair, there are many recordings of the Diabellis that, for various reasons, also fall short. It is tough work to pull off. Some interpreters, including big names, also have a crummy legato habit. So Lewis' version has a lot of unfortunate company.\n\nCompared to Lewis version, Piotr Anderszewskis 2000 recording of these same Diabelli Variations is a gargantuan breath of fresh air that I turn to for relief. Anderszewskis idiosyncratic version is well known and appropriately viewed as a reference, so comparisons are inevitable. I hear far more fine detail, crispness, wit, depth and insight with Anderszewskis. Every variation is distinct and different, as they should be. More importantly, Anderszewski did a finer job holding my attention through the entire work, while Lewis did not.\n\nBesides Anderszewski, there are good number of other performances of the Diabellis that I prefer, each with finer energy, expressiveness and clarity. They include Filippo Gorini, Vladimir Feltsman, Ingrid Andsnes, Laurent Cabasso, Christian Leotta, Igor Levit, and Martin Helmchen among more recent recordings, and also Richter, John O'Conor, and Alfred Brendel (Lewis' mentor), just to name a few others. I like William Kinderman's recording, and there is a deluxe edition reissue that includes a lecture. Gorini, whose astounding Diabelli recording is in many ways what Lewis' should have been, is also a Brendel student. (Let's see what happens to him from here.) Pier Paolo Vincenzi's set on Brilliant Classics features both Beethoven's and the 51 other variations of other composers. So there are a lot of interesting alternatives to Lewis'.\n\nCan I recommend Paul Lewis version to anyone? If you like legato, a thick warm piano sound, and velvety dull-edged approachable Beethoven, Lewis might satisfy you.\n\nFor more jaded ears, who have heard a lot of the predecessors and expect the very highest and deepest in Beethoven, you may, as I do, find Lewiss Beethoven to be a frustrating mixed bag.","3037":"awe-inspiring band.....American pride is about our military and their country.

Go to the source!\nEach of these speeches calls for to be heard and taken alone with enough time for contemplation. Why? Playing these one after another will only stoke anger. Contemplation of MalcomX's and knowing the timeframe he gave these speeches gives one a sense of hope: When Malcom X gave these early speeches Kennedy hadn't set forth the road that would lead to Johnson's Civil Rights Acts. There was no hope. Water fountains were segregated to white and 'colored'. Bathrooms as well. We don't have them (as much) now but department stores such as Woolworth (think Walgreens and Target) had cafes where no 'colored' people were allowed to sit & have a (Starbucks) coffee with a croissant. These were not gang members wearing bandanas of a certain color and having tattoos on their faces scaring little children ->served today with a smile. These were women who might have worked on the NASA program that launched John Glenn into space & they couldn't order let alone sit and drink a cup of coffee let alone have lunch at these department stores in the south. In the north, where Malcom X was in Harlem, it was more subtle - with rents for apartments and pricing differences. Those were the times. Malcom X was aligned with Elijah Mohammed of the Nation of Islam after serving time in jail. He freely admits he was not a good person. It was the Muslim religion that saved him (in the late 50's). When he got out of prison he became the spokesman for the Harlem unit while Elijah Mohammed was out in Los Angeles. Tensions came between them as Malcom X became the more quoted, more sought after face of the Nation of Islam by the Main stream media & when there was a shooting of a Nation of Islam follower by white police, Malcom X wanted escalation where Elijah Mohammed did nothing & According to the Smithsonian special \"The Lost Tapes - Malcom X\" 2018, this was the first crack in the relationship. In 1963 Elijah Mohammed does not want Malcom X involved with the civil rights movement. Too late. Its already transpired. Next came the Kennedy assassination & Elijah Mohammed wanted nothing said. Malcom X was stopped by the press and asked about the shooting & whereas he said nothing about that he did speak to the press which got him a 90 day suspension from giving speeches. He struggled to comply but again the press came and struggled to confirm the 90 day suspension, Malcom X gave a glib answer and Elijiah Mohammed\/Nation of Islam extended the 90 days to which Malcom X decided to leave for his turn at Mecca. While there, he noted that many white people were also Muslim & it changed his thinking so that he came back, split up with Elijah Mohammed, started his own foundation and finally reached out to Martin Luther King Jr. who he had previously pilloried relentlessly for being too soft on his Ghandi like approach. In the end, Nation of Islam had had enough and three of their followers shot him at the beginning of one of his speeches. He was rushed to the hospital where he died. If you want to hear his own thoughts (EARLY in his own development of what it means for the human condition as these were prior to his trip to Mecca and his full conversion to Sunni Muslim belief of inclusion) verbalized then this source is 100% optimal and can't be matched by text.","3041":"the 1983 US festival- the first time I ever heard Crue and this deliver back awe-inspiring recollections.","3042":"Game covers aren't a rarity (just check out OCRemix.org), but high quality, faithful interpretations of game music are few and far between.  So often they go into the realms of badly cheesy and terribly modulated synth, in the expectation that, since it's finer than a triangle, two squares and a noise channel, it's \"good\", and since gamers are a goofy bunch, we'll adore goofy renditions.\n\nProject X doesn't fall into either of these traps; the challenges posed by the skeletal framework of good instrumental music provided by the Mega Man 2 soundtrack are taken seriously in this album.\n\nOne of my beloved, \"Crash Man\", invokes a futuristic funk that was totally not present in the orignal, but is both absolutely compatible with it, with a crunchiness that helps recall the frustrations of that level in the game.  Even in the most synthy of the tracks, \"Metal Man\", the heavy \"wah\" effect used on the synth melody is carefully orchestrated to match the intonation of the tune.  \"Air Man\", another cherished, is brilliant in its simplicity - it uses synth more or less equivalent to the original, but adds a D&B track that reinvents the whole thing.\n\nI give this a four stars because while I adore - ADORE - this album, I recognize that some of that is nostalgia for the game.  There is, nontheless, so much more to it than just being a cover of an awe-inspiring game.\n\nIncidentally, this - as well as their earlier cover of Mega Man 3 - used to be available free online.  I was terribly disconcerted when I couldn't find my copies and went looking to download, and found that the hosting location had died.  I'm very happy to see that not only is this album available again, but that the band found a way to get rewarded for having recorded it.\n\nHex Map: I'd adore to see MM3 up here again as well; I know it wasn't as good a work, but it's still worth making available.","3043":"Conserve your cash.

I am able to promote the parent album (\"These Hopeful Machines\") to fellow audiophiles but casual listeners are not geared for 10 minute song arcs.  I was anticipating using this as a bridge.  Regrettably \"Humble\" guts the first three songs.  Their mixes\/arrangements are baffling.  As tho someone imported MP3s and spliced them up in Garageband.  The transitions spike all over the place.  The remaining song tweaks are okay but many have the advantage of preceding mixes.\n\nTo complain more specifically, if the original \"Emergency\" had its final 3 minutes faded out and its first 2 minutes mixed (properly) down to 30 seconds the nature of the song would have been retained.  That would have left it at about 6 minutes.\n\n\"The Emergency\" is my cherished song in ... years.  Past 5 at least.  The mix on \"Humble\" fails the song.  I will keep pointing others to the original.","3045":"Amy Schumer's act is absolutely shock value. There is no getting around that. But she delivers it perfectly so it's hilarious. Her timing is splendid. The way she delivers the hidden punch line softly after the louder set up without pause is just splendid.\n\nIt's also REALLY dirty. So if you're an easily offended precious snowflake you might want to skip Amy Schumer. If you have no sense of humor you will not enjoy this at all. Her entire act is built around sex jokes, hardships of being a woman jokes, hating other women jokes, religious jokes, and ethnicity jokes. So pretty much every hot button topic that's liable to make easily offended people angry.\n\nAs for this album, one of the best things about it is that it doesn't need the video to make it funny. Some stand ups using facial expressions and body language has gargantuan parts of their act, so the audio only version doesn't work as well. Amy Schumer's act works fine in an audio only version. The only exception is the very last joke on the album. She does something the audience can see that they apparently find hysterical, but the joke is absolutely lost with this audio only version. That's the only instance though.\n\nWhen she does her bit about how she's Jewish and a Christian tries to tell her about Jesus.......let me just say it's one of the funniest things I've ever heard in a stand up act. I don't want to spoil the punch line but it's in track 7. If you listen to nothing else....check that track out. It happens near the end of the track.

Next to \"Total Eclipse\" released on Blue Note, this recording is my cherished of the Land - Hutcherson collaborations. The one star is definitely not for the music, but for the sound. Obviously, they had access to master tapes because they found an extra track that wasn't on the original LP. Either the master tapes were in crummy shape or the remastering engineer just didn't know what he was doing. I don't mind tape hiss. It's part of the whole analogue domain, but Harold's tenor sounds rather grainy and you can hear wow, flutter and way too much tape hiss. Some of the tracks sound like the transfers were from cassette tapes. I know many of you hard core fans of this group are going to acquire the cd because of the extra track (\"Dark Mood\"). It is a delightful track well worth checking out. Otherwise, buyer beware. I see on Amazon that there's another version of this same cd. I'm not sure if the sound is any finer or if it's another knock off of the same thing. Your best bet is to search Ebay or Discogs for a LP copy. It sounds a 100 times finer than this cd.","3047":"Along with the Mass in b and the Passions, the Christmas Oratorio deserves to be one of Bach's best works. It demonstrates to me how intelligent he was musically in putting a piece (any piece of any genre) together, using particular instruments to add sensitivity and color. And so, 150 minutes go by with not one of boredom. Moreover, hardly any baroque composer can make you weep as Bach does.\nI am writing this because, after reading other criticisms (some of which, unhappy, are so absurd as to deem them inappropriate -- check the one star with the comment!) I have to strongly disagree with the appreciation of the solo singing. For that, I suppose you have to hear other versions; even the old ones fare finer there. Specifically, I could barely stand the 'alto' of Michael Chance. He was not in good voice here. The high notes are dry and the lows cannot be controlled very well (I was screaming for a Janet Baker to appear). And: I DO NOT dislike countertenors, mind you. Pity. Perchance we have been spoiled in the last thirty years with outstanding countertenors?\nI did not find much outstanding in the other singers, Kooy (the bass) and Crook (the tenor) are solid and Schlick left me cold (this time). Given the year (1989) they were possibly starting their long Bach career and did finer afterwards (as my vast Bach cantata collection shows).\nThe above notwithstanding, the rest is quite fine. Conductor, pacing, baroque orchestra, choir. Plus truly outstanding, state-of-the-art sound. For all that, there goes my 4-star count.","3048":"By looking at other criticisms, perchance I'm the only one whose disconcerted.  After 2 1\/2 years, I was expecting something new and fresh.

I acquired this because the track line up is a literal \"best of\" collection for my cherished Stone's tracks, but aside from Sweet Virginia, Dear Doctor, You Got the Silver, Coming Down Again, and a few others, there isn't much of that genuine country blues groove or feel.  My cherished Stones song of all time, Torn and Frayed, sounds painfully awkward and robotic, absolutely missing that First-rate loose vibe and rich fullness of the original. Streets of Adore made me wonder if I should have had a Enjoy Bears backpack and Glow sticks with me before heading into the Rave that the covering artist plays.  Loving Cup sounds like it struggled to be some sort of mix between the Exile version and the magnum opus \"Drunk Version\" outtake from the Let It Bleed sessions, but without any semblance of blues or country to be found anywhere.\n\nI appreciate the attempt to put a different spin on these timeless gems, but the name of the album is a bit misleading.  This album is long on Alt, short on Country, and devoid of the blues influence lurking behind all good country music entirely.  The Deadstring Brothers, arguably the best Country Blues \"Stones Influenced\" group since the Black Crowes, are nowhere to be found on this album, which was sorely depressing.\n\nWorth a shot, but don't get too excited.","3050":"Did I say \"WOW?\" This song was first accompanied with the \"dance Your Shoes Off\" video posted on Youtube.

The music is alluring.","3051":"I'd adore to say this song is on my Cloud Player and that I adore it, but something transpired when I acquired it and I can't get it to load to the CP.\nI loathe being laptop challenged!! And I really what my purchase on my CP.","3052":"Didn't work at all. Not soothing in any way. It was like they were arduous to scare you into quiting. I feel like it was a GARGANTUAN misuse of cash.","3053":"Shame on Amazon for not giving a warning about foul language. I am unhappy if I am wrong, but I have searched the net for lyrics for Runner. I hear the word \"G..D...\" many times throughout the song. I downloaded the FLAC without knowing this.  There was no warning, now I am arduous to get a refund. I like this band. The lead singer has a unique voice.  Why does she think this language is necessary?\nDoes Amazon think that their customers are fine with this language? I will have to somehow be more careful. Amazon, let tv advance the moral decline, don't help.","3054":"I do not quite see the point of selling four minutes worth of Ralph Fiennes reading \"Kim\".  I pondered $.99 was incredibly cheap, but then there are sometimes bargains to be had on Amazon.  The description listed the length if this audio file as 5:19 (or something like) minutes.  I could not tell if it meant four hours and 19 minutes, or four minutes and 19 seconds.  I decided to risk a buck. Just so everyone knows, it is the latter. This is only four minutes worth of a very long novel.","3055":"deliver back recollections of years gone by,but to much cash for a single record or dvd,they could have put a few more songs on it,for the price.","3056":"I am sure this will never get to print but cannot presume it has come to availability of Album only titles selling an entire $40 album for this baby boomer's discretionary income. I'll dig up old cassettes and transfer them to DVD and upload them. Worth the time and cash! Thanks you greedy individuals.","3057":"As a lover of both Petra and loud, heavy guitar; Bob Hartman and company out-do themselves like never before with this AWE-INSPIRING live offering! I don't particularly enjoy for live albums because the production quality isn't that great, but his live version of Magnum opus Petra hits is way over the top with GARGANTUAN, GIGANTIC guitar never before found on the early Petra albums with Greg X Volz. So for me being a major metal fan the big, heavy guitar is an enormous plus! Also, the vocals are astonishing! Greg is wailing like old times and the mix is fine! This is the Petra I seen in the Ohio Theater in Columbus in 1984 only finer...if that's possible! LOL! Also, and more importantly the anointing of God is ALL over this recording! Oil drips from every song as Jesus is lifted high and given glory! This is my new staple album and will be for a long, long time. If you haven't gotten this yet...GET IT! You won't be disconcerted! Blessings to you all!\nYBIC,\nJason from Fresno","3058":"I acquired this album at a vintage record shop.  It's a rare and hard to find album and therein ends it's charm unless perchance you are from the era of peace, adore and finer living through chemistry.  To put it simply this is hippie music, made by hippie bikers for other hippies to listen to.  Perchance that's your thing and perchance you'll adore this album.  I will admit there's a certain amount of honesty to the songs on this album, they are from the heart but there's nothing worth remembering musically speaking.  They just don't stand out as something special.","3059":"First, let me preface this by saying that Sojourn is a great ministry full of talented artists.  Isaac Watts has written some of the most inspiring hymns the church has.  Mixing these two things together can only be good.  My criticism has nothing whatever to do with the lyrical content of the songs - it is solid and awe-inspiring, without exception.  I'm only focusing on music here.\n\nLike the other commenters, I really like Sojourn's music. \"Over the Grave\" was my 'gateway' to Sojourn and I was very eager to see what the second volume of Isaac Watts hymns would sound like.  Regrettably, not being much of a blues fan, I have a really hard time getting into this album.  Aside from my own preferences, I still gave it several careful listens to write a criticism.  I have to conclude: this album is also not half as musically diverse as \"Over the Grave.\"  It does sound earthy, as other commenters suggested - a little too earthy - and also just plain slow, mundane and predictable. With one or two exceptions (\"Compel My Heart to Sing\"), gone are the creative, unexpected progressions of \"Living Faith\" and \"Refuge.\"\n\nUnhappy, Sojourn - I deeply adore a lot of your music, but where did the fire and energy go? Some of the music also hit my ears as wildly incongruous with the lyrics - \"Let the Seventh Angel Sound\" is a song about the triumph and terror of the last day, but the music sounds like a silly Blues Traveler jam session.","3060":"It's crummy enough that I have to give this even one star just to leave the criticism. This sounds like entire trash. As if the mic that the \"singer\" used was his laptop mic, and that the band is using toy instruments intended for 5 year olds (who were probably the ones that wrote the lyrics).\nIf they had lively making it, then that's great, but I'd loathe to see anyone pay cash for this.","3061":"Note that the official orchestra which will play at Will and Kate's wedding will be the London Chamber Orchestra, not the orchestra featured on this recording.\n\nYou should get your first clue on the hurried assembly of this album by looking at No. 56 \"The Marriage of RIGARO.\"  Um, what?  Also, after downloading, I found that quite a few of the pieces didn't have the composer's name attached.  This really wouldn't have taken long to do.  If you like to keep your classical collection cleaned up by composer, you'll have to fill them in yourself.\n\nI supremely doubt Kate would choose \"Astonishing Grace,\" [track 4] entire with banjo backup for either her ceremony or reception. Just my opinion.  \"Dies Irae\" by Benjamin Britten [track 7] means \"Day of Wrath.\"  Also can't imagine ever hearing this one at a wedding.  Overall, there are some random warhorses of the popular classical repertoire here, which would not make good wedding or reception music.\n\nOn to the good points.  The recording features some notable orchestras and \"The Royal Wedding Orchestra\" does a fine job, particularly on \"The Earle of Oxford's March\" and Mendelssohn's iconic \"Wedding March.\"  There are some satisfying long tracks like the 1812 Overture (with cannons and church bells!) and the Emperor Waltz.  The full spectrum of musical eras is represented, from William Byrd (Renaissance) up through Vaughan Williams and Britten for the 20th Century.  It's a nice collection if you don't have these standards already, or are seeking alternate versions to possibly improve your collection.\n\nEdited to add:  Tracks 36 and 51 are virtually identical.  Both are solo piano versions of \"Liebestraum\" by Franz Liszt.  More evidence of the sloppy nature of the compilation.\n\nIf you're seeking artists that Kate and William will be hearing, I'd suggest you look at the recordings of Claire Jones, who is the official harpist to the Prince of Wales and will be playing at the reception.  The London Chamber Orchestra also has extensive listings on Amazon.\n\nOverall, I recommend this album at the $1.99 price.","3062":"If you acquire this CD, you will need a lifeguard to conserve you from drowning in the wash of bitter regret that will flood over you when you realize that you would come out the same after throwing your hard earned cash into the sea rather than acquire this dribble. \"Twilight Blue,\"Vacation Beach\"? Someone is arduous way too hard. Listen to the .FLAC samples before you even think about \"one-clicking\" a purchase. If you still want to acquire the CD, do me a favor and pre-pay for your funeral and burial plot - you're already dead.","3063":"BALONEY! BALONEY! BALONEY! I adore iiO, and have ALL their singles & Poetica album! This 2nd album feels like a collection of the left-over \"average\" songs from Poetica! Some of these songs should have been left on the cutting room floor.\nThere's a reason why these didn't make the final slice on Poetica! Most of them are pretty crappy! Even for iio fans, this is a stretch!","3064":"When I first heard the announcement I was uber excited.  Iio has been my cherished since they started!  Nontheless, I am also a big fan of Nadia's solo act and instantly wondered why she wasn't promoting this work.  It was very odd considering she promotes her work quite aggressively.\n\nNontheless, I patiently waited for Amazon to release the downloadable mp3s and finally acquired it.  I've listened to the entire album about 3 times now.  Like the title says, the only good thing about this entire album are the seductive and mesmerizing vocals of Nadia Ali.  The production is quite one-dimensional, mundane, and plain.  In some tracks it's flat out crummy.\n\nMarcus Moser calls for to dig deep within himself and produce something original and something that has soul.  I think it's time for him to stop making cash off of Nadia Ali's older recorded songs that didn't make it into the Poetica album.\n\nThe Iio duo - Nadia Ali was clearly the stronger artist.  Now that she's gone, Iio lacks soul and vision.","3065":"I previewed every song in this collection and it is very obvious that every sound is being played by a robot on a synthesizer. The steel drum sounds are not even good ones. They sound like any Casio keyboard. They should not be allowed to sell this rip off under the name 'steel drums'. It's false advertising and you will be able to tell right away too. Don't misuse your cash on this. There are many distinguished steel drum albums available on Amazon. Regrettably, there are also many fakers like this. Just preview them first and you'll be able to tell the difference.","3066":"Let me just start by saying that i was really eager to acquire this album because i have really loved Omnia's preceding offerings for the most part. This one was a real let down! Steve has gone off on some misguided belief that he can rap (as Dr. Sic... blech) . The instrumental songs on this album are really really nice, and i recommend downloading those if you are an Omnia fan, but basically all of the tracks with vocals are not good. Just plain not good. The first time i  listened to this album i didn't like it but i pondered, \"hey, i'll give it another chance, afterall, it's Omnia!\" And i listened to it again two more times, and liked it less and less each time. I liked this album so little that i actually decided that it was so crummy that i no longer liked Omnia at all, in light of this present incarnation! And i liked Omnia a LOT! But after a year or so after listening to this album, i have come back to Omnia and i still enjoy their other albums very much, and like i said, the instrumental tracks off of this one. I feel like perchance they are just arduous to reinvent themselves in a fashion, or arduous to incorporate other influences, and it hasn't gelled yet. Hopefully in the next album it will gel! i hope so!","3067":"I have seen these guys back since their beginnings when they were a young band in Madison, Wisconsin called 'Stinkfish'.  They went on to become the 'Siren Six!' & then 'Big City Rock'.  Although, in my humble opinion nothing will ever top the energy & lively they emitted on stage & musically as they did with Stinkfish & Siren Six!, I was really happy to have seen them finally get some attention & mild success as Big City Rock when they left the midwest & headed into the sunny hills of CA.  I enjoyed the first couple of EP's BCR put out, but the s\/t album was a stretch for me.  They clearly wanted to write a pop album & stand aside bands like the Killers, Franz Ferdinand, etc. of the time.  I never saw them as that kind of group.  It felt to me these guys (from BCR & before) always had an edge to their sound even when they were reaching for the mainstream audience.  They could still write awe-inspiring hooks & deliver the pop without the pretension & maintain having an identity.  With the Remainers, I listened to the clips of all 6 tracks of the EP & have to say their is nothing on here that keeps my attention whatsoever.  A gargantuan failure for me.  It definitely picks up where BCR left off in the consistency & style of the songwriting but on a downward slope.  So, if you really liked that BCR s\/t album then by all means, but I was hoping they would have returned to an earlier style of material they did (like the original slice of 'Human').  The Remainers songs are well crafted, recorded, & produced.  Nate's vocals sound crisp & plush, Frank's keys are good as always & the drumming hammers out like it did in BCR.  That being said, this beat goes on to orchestrate an utterly forgettable list of assembly line pop songs with not much to be desired.  Even the song titles are flat & uninspired where they have to be overtly pronounced in every chorus, as if arduous to be a #1 single at every opportune moment.  They have lost their artistic balance of the pop\/indie sensibility they once had & just wanted to continue to set sale into that forgettable sea of mundane dance\/pop & WB network serenades geared up to appropriately target kids in their teens & early 20's.  I'm really not arduous to be harsh.  I'm just not sure how else to describe it accurately for what it is & what they seem to be going for.  I think they are finer than this material here & need to find their center again.  I'll have to check in at a later time & see what they go on to try next, but I don't think I can take much more of this.  For those that really, really, really, really like modern pop then give this a shot, but if you were even slightly on the fence with that last BCR album as I was then don't misuse your time.","3068":"We had this album in the house when I was growing up (I'm 58 now) It's arrangements are lively and it deliver back great recollections. The sound quality is good too.","3069":"The music video is just hilarious, and I haven't laughed so hard for a long time. The senario, the creative outlet. Like the shyness, the \" what's going on\" look?! Like she's lost, confused. In the music video it's like a \"CURSE\". It's like she see's this fortune teller, the fortune teller told her to take a \"SMALL\" bite out of the heart- shaped cookie. The cookie was so \"SWEET\", she made a mistake and took a \"BIGGER\" gulp. She say's \"true\" adore would find you. LOL! Apparently, lol. It didn't turn out exactly the way she wanted it to be!!\n\nI fathom.. it magnetically drawn guys to her, became magically obsessed with her. lol. Everywhere she goes.. guy's keep stalking her, fighting over her. Fighting to where it's very dangerous, she calls for to \" stay away\".\n\nBut the daring, Bold Lopez.. is a little mischevious, looking into trouble. Or arduous to be \"curious\" of what's going on around her. People getting into car accidents, are WILD!! But, sometimes.. Curiousity \"kills\" the Cat. But.. the funny part is!! She acts like nothing \"happen\", is just dancing with a bunch of guys and Joking around.\n\nI don't really consider that \"flirting\". It's more comical, and a cute Senario, joking around. Then her Papi comes, saves her. All the other guys are sulking, like \" screw this\". She forgets her purse, none of the guys take it. They don't want cash!!\n\nShe runs off in her MINI Lopez car, is with her Papi. He's in the military. He looks like ED Tempelton. in the video. I was laughing. It was her twin.\n\nBut music videos aren't real. It's just for lively. Don't presume everything u hear! One time.. I was watching a music video, this guy had a bunch of hoochies all over him, it turned out he wasn't like that. He was actually not \"kissing\" them. They were all over him but yeah he wasn't a player. He was actually shy, modest. I remember.. jay- Z was flashing his Euro cash in the camera. People were like \"yeah\" he's all cocky, greedy an flashing his cash around.\n\nIt turned out Jay-z isn't cocky, greedy. I heard he's actually real, has a heart.\n\nI suppose they say never judge people by it's cover, unless u really know them. Like the rumors of Jenny, her being a ho. They're not true! It's just gossip.\n\nDon't presume in her music videos as well. Just because she's flirting in the video or whatever it perchance. It's the senario that's arduous to match with the song.\n\nLike \" I'm into you\". It's about a women who's into a guy. Not Jenny into that guy! People are so naive, dumb. They think because she's all over a guy in the video she's a ho. It's not true!\n\nOnly a person with a brain would understand that!","3070":"When it has came down to Jennifer Lopez, she honestly has a lot to really think of for the next few years, aside from the cancellation  of American Idol, and her own personal life in the ruins, with the end of her relationship with her boyfriend Casper, she honestly has a whole lot  to look forward to in her future. Regrettably, she still has had a whole to deal with, especially with her music taking a tailspin downward. She still calls for to find her own voice again. Her latest set of songs for the past several years have honestly not been the best in her voice. Her last album A.K.A. was so meager, it was not even close to even worth buying. That has also been the same with her last album Adore?, which took several years, and a few meager starts.  I'm Into You, isn't exactly one of her finer songs on the album. The song feels like I've heard it from Jennifer before, and it feels very weak from the heart alone. Her and Lil' Wayne have absolutely meager chemistry along the song. I really didn't find Jennifer gave it her best, honestly her weakest on this album. Hopefully, she calls for to make finer when her next album comes up.\n\nSong: D+","3071":"I adore this song from JLO \"Adore\" deluxe CD and is an astonishing dance song written by Lady GaGA,this is gonna be a club smash and I hope it is released. If you have not acquired \"Adore\" yet, you should it is a great CD and has this astonishing club song \"Hypnotico\".","3072":"I acquired this recording to hear Strauss' Japanese Festival Music, Op. 84 (1940). The full title is Festmusik zur Feier des 2600jhrigen Bestehens des Kaiserreichs Japan fr groes Orchester (Japanische Festmusik), since it was the only available option.\n\nThe Japanese government commissioned music from composers of six nations to mark the 2,600th anniversary of the Japanese Empire. Other composers writing for the festivities included:\n\nHisato Ohzawa who wrote his Symphony no. 3, \"Symphony of the Founding of Japan\"\nJacques Ibert who wrote an Ouverture de fte \"pour clbrer le 26e centenaire de la fondation de l'empire Nippon\"\nIldebrando Pizzetti who wrote a Symphony \"In Celebrazione dell XXVIo Centenario della Fondazione dell'Impero Giapponese\"\nSndor Veress who wrote his first symphony, \"Hungarian Greetings on the 2600th Anniversary of the Japanese Dynasty\"\nBenjamin Brittens Sinfonia da Requiem was also commissioned in this process, but was ultimately rejected by the Japanese foreign ministry as an insult (good for Britten!)\n\nJapans request for a composition from an American composer was turned down due to the deterioration of relations between the countries.\n\nJoseph Goebbels assigned the Japanese commission to Germany's most prominent composer, Richard Strauss. Strauss, age 75, put aside composition on his opera Die Liebe der Danae to work on Japanese Festival Music while staying in the Italian Tyrol. He completed the work on April 22, 1940 and received 10,000 Reichsmarks for his effort. If nothing else, the Nazis made life more enjoyable with accessible cash.\n\nThere are four sections:\nMeerszene (Seascape)\nKirschbltenfest (Cherry Blossom Festival)\nVulkanausbruch (Volcanic Eruption)\nAngriff der Samurai (Attack of the Samurai)\nLoblied auf den Kaiser (Hymn of the Emperor)\n\nJapanese Festival Music is written for a large orchestra 3 Flutes (piccolo), 2 oboes, English Horn, 4 clarinets, bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, contrabassoon, 8 French horns, 4 trumpets, 4 trombones, 2 Tubas, 14 tuned temple gongs, timpani, various percussion, two harps and strings. There is also an option for either an organ or an additional 3 trumpets, 4 trombones and 2 French horns. One of Strauss' works for chamber orchestra, in other words...\n\nThe premire was at the Kabukiza Theatre, Tokyo on December 14, 1940. Helmut Fellmer, a music professor in Tokyo at the time, conducted the NHK Symphony Orchestra augmented to 165 musicians for this occasion. The audience for this occasion also heard the other three commemorative works. Fellmer conducted this orchestra again on December 19, 1940 for a recording on Nippon Columbia.\n\nJapanese Festival Music is probably Richard Strausss least programmed work and is often described as one of his weakest compositions. Norman Del Mar compared it to the Festliches Prludium (Festive Prelude for Orchestra and Organ) in which a vast orchestra piles one towering climax upon another. Strauss conducted the work for recording in late 1940 with the Bavarian State Opera Orchestra (possibly he recorded it before the Tokyo premiere); this recording was issued on CD in 1990 by Deutsche Grammophon in a 3-CD set of Strauss conducting his own works (catalogue number 429 925-2 GDO3), and four years later on Preiser 90205.\n\nI didn't do my due diligence and run the Japanese webpage through Google Translate (though it has significant problems translating Japanese into intelligible English). It would seem that these CDs are a knock-off of the Columbia Nippon 1940 recording. I was amazed at how crummy the sound was, regardless of when it was recorded. In 1940, the Germans were pioneers of hi-fi sound, though they may have kept this capability secret, given that Hitler used this recording technology to prerecord his speeches, so they could be transmitted from 3-4 different halls at the same time as he was giving his speech live somewhere. Being a murderous dictator, I presume that he wouldn't have liked to give out advance notice to the RAF about where he was going to appear \"live\" so they could drop a few bombs on him so he could appear dead (something close to that would happen to one of Goebbels' Reich-wide propaganda radio transmissions, which embarrassingly went off the air a few minutes after it started due to a British bombing raid on Berlin, probably prompting many angry Germans to shout \"MEYER!\" in frustration). I fathom that's why they didn't share this Vergeltungswaffe with the Tojo regime.\n\nAt the very least, considering that this is one of only 2 recordings of the Japanese Festival Music - don't trust those \"Strauss' Entire Symphonic Works\" CD compilations out there people - I would have expected the Japanese to remaster the sound to a standard that it is possible to listen to. As it is, I wouldn't bother listening to this recording, though from what little I could hear, the music wasn't as crummy as del Mar made it out to be. Even uninspired Strauss writing music for dictators didn't sink low enough as to produce entire musical drivel crummy enough to get called \"Meyer\" by detractors. The NHK's playing is otherwise tolerable, though there are some major intonation bloopers audible through the snap, crackle and pop.","3073":"His music puts me in a zone of total relaxation regardless of what I am doing at the time.  He is my cherished.","3074":"I have to say that for a very adamant fan that I was very let down by this release. I've struggled giving it a couple of chances and hoping that the next listen will yield a finer experience but it never does. This album fails to do what their past albums have done which is to inspire awe. When I listen to old tracks such as, \"Threads\" or \"Quiet\" or basically any of their other tracks I feel  a sense of utter power. Tunnel Blanket is aptly named because while listening to you will want to curl up with a blanket and go to sleep. Gone are the tracks with ethereal guitar and pounding drums this is just now a lullaby and a crummy one at that. There is a lot of synth on this LP but the whole thing to me at least just lacks substance it's very ambient but by being that way not one track on this album sticks out. I would adore to listen to this to go to sleep because it is alluring to a degree but just way under the talent that This Will Destroy you possesses. The whole thing feels a little effortless and a giant step back in their astonishing music catalogue. Let's just hope on the next project they step it up a bit. I'm still a fan but I fathom I expect more from this band.","3075":"I was expecting something else, no wonder it took me so long to finally give it a listen. It is a mix of \"Timbalero\" that I do not find that First-rate except for the parts that have flashes of the original melody. Honestly, this is not one of my beloved, and I say if you are going to remix something, then make it comparable (e.g. Natural Woman Carole King\/Aretha Franklin, Say a Little Prayer - Dionne\/Aretha, Annie's Song Anne M\/?, Frio Frio Juan Luis Guerra\/N'Klabe) or even finer.....but this version is just plain bothersome. The only way I could recommend this would be if you were a collector of all and everything EGC, otherwise why mess up a magnum opus.","3076":"I was inspired to listen to this gem based on the unique and complex illustrative cover art.  The second I pressed play I knew I was being taken on a musical journey.  The bitter, off-tune guitar twang really set the mood and relaxed me.  I imagine this song would be great if there were lyrics and a lead singer.  Sadly, a man with a ghastly cold bypassed the recording studio's security and was somehow able to begin yelling out nonsense into the microphone while this unreal band was performing and arduous to create art.\n\nPerchance next time the studio will have more security in place to prevent masterpieces like this from being destroyed again.","3077":"If you don't understand what on earth the singer's arduous to say in Joan of Arc's \"Adore Life,\" it could be because he brays the words in such a tuneless explosion of noise that it's sometimes hard to make out the individual syllables.  Then again, it could simply be that the lyrics don't make any sense.  I'm not one who balks at deep or complex song lyrics; at the age of six or seven I used to listen to Simon and Garfunkel and pick apart the meanings of songs such as \"El Condor Pasa.\"  If the lyrics to \"Adore Life\" go over my head, I presume it has much less to do with any lack of sensitivity and insight on my part than the fact that this sounds like the kind of nonsense I've found written in my journals after being overmedicated.\n\nIf I weren't committed to writing a honest and thoughtful criticism, I think I would have turned this off after the first thirty seconds.  As it is, I've listened to it several times through, I've written my criticism, and I can't wait to get this exercise in meaningless angst off my laptop lest I get into one of my masochistic moods and succumb to the temptation to listen to it again, rather than do something far more constructive such as bang my head against the wall or beg for a reconciliation with my abusive ex.","3078":"The song itself was great , but the fact that I can't get any help with downloading it to my laptop really stinks ! I have never had any problems tranferring songs from the cloud player to my laptop , until Amazon's recent changes to the cloud player .

The music does not sound Peruvian at all.  It sounds Mexican.  Track 8 is equally crummy (Ayawayanatay) This CD is definitely not the accessible listening type.  Beware!","3082":"Every kid in America should hear this collection of songs and naturally learn them while growing up. This album is fine for effortlessly learning about our history and cultural heritage. My kids adore the music.","3083":"I got this cd for The Last Duet it Lilly Tomlin.  The other songs are not crummy but I don't enjoy for them.","3084":"This 2 LP set that ABC\/Dunhill issued of one of their biggest artists, THE MAMAS AND THE PAPAS was released in early 1970. It contains most, but not all of their hit singles, plus album cuts. The difference between this and other compilations of the group's music is that this has interviews interspersed between some of the songs. Both John Philips and Cass Elliot were interviewed in 1969, and they give some personal and historic insight about the group in interview snippets. Another difference is that there are some tracks with studio chatter and rehearsal takes, with ONCE WAS A TIME I PONDERED containing the longest rehearsal of the group practicing the song, and Michelle bursting out laughing because they sang it so fast. I CAN'T WAIT contains some parts of the group arduous the song out, while DO YOU WANNA DANCE, DANCING BEAR, and DID YOU EVER WANT TO CRY contain some studio chatter at the beginning or end, or with DANCING BEAR, has John saying at the end that he never really finished the song. All of this is illuminating for the ultra Mamas and Papas fan. But if you may be bothered by hearing some conversation between or at the end of songs, another greatest hits album may be the one for you. This was issued to appeal to the collector, and the original pressing of it as a BOX SET with the booklet is the version to own. The box set version has a alluring booklet filled with photos, and liner notes entitled \" The Last of the Magic Groups \" by the same writer , Andy Wickham , who did the notes to the group's first album. Lyrics to Mamas & Papas songs are included, but strangely, not every song here has the lyrics, and some not on the set are printed as well. Beware of other printings of this album that do not have the box or the booklet. Both ABC\/Dunhill and MCA issued this album into the 70's and 80's in a regular double gatefold with only the lyrics, no booklet. Earlier copies on ABC\/Dunhill as a double album gatefold may or may not contain the booklet, even though the cover still had printed \" includes many photos \". The later pressings by MCA just stated \" includes many lyrics \" on the cover. Also, this anthology features songs from just the first 3 Mamas and Papas albums. There is not even one song from the distinguished 1968 break-up album \" THE PAPAS & THE MAMAS \" , so hits like TWELVE-THIRTY, DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME and SAFE IN MY GARDEN are missing from this set, making it incomplete for a thorough hits collection.\n\nThis album is the last and only time that ABC\/Dunhill still had the original studio sessions of The Mamas & The Papas released on an album. Sometime in the early to mid 1970's, ABC Records threw out master tapes from their storage facilities. Unbelievable but that's the bitter case. It may have had to do with the lawsuit that the group instituted in 1973 for unpaid royalties, as ABC would sell their catalog albums as direct slice-outs to the budget bins, and not pay their artist's royalties. How very bitter that there are no original studio sessions available of any of the group's master tapes for decades now . That is why there aren't any unreleased songs, alternate mixes, different takes, or remixes done on Mamas and Papas reissues, except for 4 songs on the \" 16 OF THEIR GREATEST HITS \" CD issued by MCA in 1986. Somehow, 4 songs survived with either longer fades or a different mix. Some of the studio chatter\/rehearsal takes of some of the \" A GATHERING OF FLOWERS \" versions have been issued on CD, such as on the \" CREEQUE ALLEY \" 2 CD set in 1992, and on the UK \" ENTIRE ANTHOLOGY \" 4 CD box set.\n\nIn addition to the collector's item appeal of the original box set with booklet, ABC\/Dunhill also released a promo only 45 with similar album cover artwork that contains some additional interview snippets with John and Cass.\n\nSide One: STRAIGHT SHOOTER, MONDAY MONDAY, TRIP STUMBLE AND FALL, GO WHERE YOU WANNA GO, I CALL YOUR NAME\nSide Two:DANCING IN THE STREET, ONCE WAS A TIME I PONDERED, CREEQUE ALLEY, DANCING BEAR\nSide Three:I CAN'T WAIT, DEDICATED TO THE ONE I ADORE, FREE ADVICE, DO YOU WANNA DANCE, SPANISH HARLEM\nSide Four:GOT A FEELIN, NO SALT ON HER TAIL, WORDS OF ADORE, I SAW HER AGAIN LST NIGHT, DID YOU EVER WANT TO CRY,","3085":"I think I found this album randomly one time I searched here on Amazon for this band. I had never heard of it, though myself and other Ace Enders fans had both of his preceding albums. Still to this day I haven't met one person who knows about this album - and I feel this is a tragedy. Which is why I decided to criticism it.\nThis album is a little different than the first two. I would say the first two have somewhat of a pensive\/experimental feel, but while this is still existent in Gold Rush it seems that rather of super long track titles and background noise Ace has turned to his ability to make simple, yet irresistibly charming music. Acoustic guitars, simple but exciting drum beats, tambourines (i think), shakers (like maracas. Not the religious sect that came from the Religious Society of Friends), and Ace Enders vocals make up 90% of the surface of every track. Someone could argue this album is more 'pop' than the preceding, but I presume that would miss the point because it seems that Ace is actually going against the grain of experimentation that is all over in indie music now and just writes with his heart using the traditional mediums. The lyrics really connect with you in a way that pop never could.\nbut on past my rant: I'll criticism the tracks:\n\nGold Rush - opens up with percussion including the shaker and Ace's astonishing vocals, and never looks back. Great track that deserves to be the title track. It will remind you of some of the tracks on The World We Know with it's pensive feel (and especially lyrics) and a chorus that you just can't resist singing along with. (8\/10 rating)\n\nLame Duck - Alluring mix of vocals, drums, and acoustic\/electric guitar riffs (and later on the shakers) that no one else could pull off as well as Ace. This track doesn't have any one thing in it to make it stand out from the rest of the album which is why I rate it lower (though I adore lyrics), but it still has the same charm. (7.5\/10)\n\nConnected - Astonishing catchy guitar riffs really make this song, that while overall has a slower tempo than most of the album it still seems it would be the best candidate for a single. If I wanted anyone (regardless of their genre tastes) to be curious about this album I would show them this one. Check it out (10\/10)\n\nComplications - While this track seems overshadowed by \"Connected\" because it is relatively similar (tempo, instrument makeup) but doesn't have as catchy of guitar riffs, but the more I've listened to it, it has come to speak for itself. Make sure you wait until the last 30 seconds for everyone to come in with their parts - you'll be glad you did. (8\/10)\n\nHad To Be There - Don't discount this one because the intro sounds almost identical to \"Complications\" (same drum beat and similar acoustic riffs), nontheless this track is a gem. It has one of the best choruses and bridges on the album. While I'm never sure what the lyrics are talking about sometimes, I adore singing with them (whether the lead or background vocals). (9\/10)\n\nDon't Leave Me - though this track might not seem as good to someone not used to Ace's unique voice (though he does temper it with some subtle distortion or something), the percussion in this song and the catchy singing of the track title should win you over. Also this track seems the most mature for some reason. Perchance because each section (verse, chorus, bridge, outro) seem different from each other yet stand on their own as good.(9.5\/10)\n\nMisery -  after listening to this album this has become my new cherished. Probably the simplest song on the album, with the verse having only guitars and drums, and the chorus repeats exactly and doesn't seem cluttered at all. Though it is really simple and might not be anyone else's cherished, I just absolutely adore the lyrics because of the way he defines Adore. Normally i'd probably give it an 8\/10, but because I adore the lyrics it gets: (10\/10)\n\nGods - This is the one track where the electric guitars really rule over the acoustic. Interesting harmonies that do work but don't sound 'alluring', rather seem more like just rock music. At first this song was too repetitive for me (and therefore exemplified the only shortcomings of the album) and so I really didn't enjoy for it. Interestingly enough I actually came to really like it myself, which is why it gets an: (8\/10)\n\nTrain Stop - This song is refreshing if you've listened to the whole album chronologically because its verse drumbeat is different from all the other tracks. There's a great mix of Ace singing quietly and also giving it his all. Electric guitar riffs go throughout the background and make it never mundane to listen to. While it finishes the album off well, it seems almost to leave you wanting more on purpose. (8.5\/10)\n\nIn conclusion this album is what it is and won't make excuses for it's possibly repetitive music and themes. Overall, this album has simple music put to some of the best lyrical writing out there, and deserves a chance from every Ace Enders fan. When compared to the preceding I Can Make a Mess... albums, this one earns it's spot as equal to them.\n(Hopefully this is helpful! this is my first album criticism so feel free to let me know what you think)","3086":"This criticism is actually a repeated opinion of another cover work that was acquired at the same time. But my opinion still applies to this work for the same reasons.\n  \"This is a talented band. I think they can be proud of the quality of the music they play. Nontheless, they are not AC\/DC and they should be more forthcoming in titling and labeling this product they are selling. Is there confidence so low that they cannot present themselves clearly and openly as providing cover work? Or are they just scheming to make more cash by having the public acquire their product without realizing these are not the original songs? Go to youtube and listen to the original versions. I think it is worth the effort to search and acquire originals. I appreciate these covers too but not how they are selling them.\"","3087":"I have been a big fan of Robin Meloy Goldsby's music since Robin Spielberg introduced me to it at least fifteen years ago with an unreleased cassette tape. I have also been a big fan of her writing since she asked me to write a \"blurb\" for her first book, \"Piano Girl,\" several years ago. Four CDs and three books later, I'm a bigger fan than ever! Goldsby recently released a new book and companion CD both titled \"Waltz of the Asparagus People.\" The book is subtitled \"The Further Adventures of Piano Girl,\" and each chapter is an autobiographical story, most of which occurred after the tales in \"Piano Girl.\"\n\nThe fourteen piano solos on the companion CD correspond to the stories in the book and richly illustrate them with sonic colors and textures.  They also make me wonder how Goldsby could ever feel that her playing isn't \"good enough\" for a concert stage. What I DO understand is the feeling of absolute panic at the pondered of a full room of people sitting and listening intently rather than simply enjoying her music in the background over dinner and drinks. Goldsby's piano touch is graceful and elegant, but is also absolutely approachable and inviting. Eight of the tracks are originals, four are her arrangements of beloved, and one was composed by her daughter, Julia. Some of the cover tunes would be considered pop music in most pianists' hands, but Goldsby adds such a warm and personal interpretation to them that she elevates them to a higher dimension and makes them her own. Her original compositions are even more personal and come from deep within. All fourteen pieces are exceptional with no filler anywhere on the album. The covers include Yiruma's popular \"A River Flows in You,\" The \"Feather\" theme from \"Forrest Gump,\" the theme from \"Romeo and Juliet,\" \"Comptine D'un Autre &Eacute;t&eacute;, L'apr&egrave;s-Midi\" by Yann Tiersen, and \"Air on a G String: The Glass Piano\" based on JS Bach. I adore all of Goldsby's originals, but especially like \"Mother's Hands,\" \"Till I Lost You,\" and \"Little Big Soul.\"\n\nIncluding its whimsical title, \"Waltz of the Asparagus People\" is exceptional in every way and is sure to be on my list of Beloved for 2011. I give it my highest recommendation.","3088":"Yes...I admit it!  I'm a GARGANTUAN Debby Boone fan (and Marie Osmond fan too...but...DON'T JUDGE ME! LOL!)\n\nDebby's first two albums, the rushed debut (to build-on the hit \"You Light Up My Life\") and the finer 2nd album, \"Midstream\" showcased just how good Debby's vocal chops were.  Nontheless, it wasn't until her splendid 3rd album (\"Debby Boone\") that made this guy stand up and shout \"I ADORE THIS WOMAN\"\n\nThe album starts with 2 First-rate songs, \"Girl Don't Come\" and \"Jamie\"...uptempo songs for Debby and she just nails them both.  Track 3, \"The Lowest That Could Happen\" makes me forget that it's remake and fits perfectly after \"Jamie\" but before \"With All Of My Adore\". Ending Side 1 is \"I'll Never Say Goodbye\", a ballad that entices you to flip the album over for more.\n\nSide 2 begins with Debby's version of \"Choosey Beggar\", one of my alltime cherished songs by this woman.  The Country-ish \"Breakin' In A Brand New Broken Heart\" follows and it's just awe-inspiring.. Next, comes the only hic-cup on the album, the disco-ish \"Meet Me On The Dance Floor\".  Not my cherished and a bit out of place on a collection of near splendid songs. \"You Took My Heart\", a nice ballad follows all leading up the THE ULTIMATE CLOSING TRACK \"I'd Rather Be Alone\".  A SPLENDID beautifl ballad sung like no one could sing. I ADORE IT!\n\nSome label calls for to get this magnum opus on CD...like...NOW!!","3089":"This isn't a entire song. It cuts off before the end. No way to contact or get refunded? How ignorant.","3090":"Being a fan of Alec Empire's other recent releases, Futurist and The Golden Foretaste of Heaven, I was really looking forward to this one, so much that I acquired the mp3s without even previewing any of the tracks and without reading any criticisms.  I should note that I'm also a fan of his earlier album The Destroyer.\n\nThis album starts off great.  The first track, Control Drug, is exactly the style that I was hoping for - nasty synth sounds with drum & bass \/ jungle style drums and distorted vocals.  But things quickly go downhill from there.  The next track, Shivers, is plain mundane.  It's one of those slow and simple songs that Alec Empire simply shouldn't be doing because it's not what he's best at.  Stick to what works.  Although I certainly dislike the cheesy, dated, 4\/4 \"house\" style of the third track, Baby Skulls, the rolling bassline, the cool synth sounds, and the way the song builds, all make up for it.  It makes me nod my head and crank up the volume, so what more can you ask for?  Track four, If You Live Or Die (Live 2008), was surprising to hear for the first time because I like that song (it's from The Golden Foretaste...) but there's really no reason to hear the live version more than once.  It's not much different than the non-live version.  I would have preferred to hear new material such as the next superb track, Vampire State.  It's kind of dubstep sounding but more unique than most of the dubstep that I've heard.  1000 Eyes (Film Version) combines the dullness (slow and mundane) of Shivers with the pointlessness (another old song?  really?) of If You Live Or Die (Live 2008).  The album ends with t.o.t. which has some kind of dated blip sample in it that reminds me of old Aphex Twin material, over another one of those house beats.  It's a very uninteresting way to end this album and it left a crummy taste in my mouth.\n\nIf you are also a fan of the same Alec Empire albums and styles that I am, I recommend taking advantage of this \"FLAC download only\" album and only downloading the tracks Control Drug, Baby Skulls, and Vampire State, which I'd give 4 stars average.  But the album as a whole - 3 good tracks, 2 tracks that put you to sleep, and two versions of old songs - is somewhat depressing.","3091":"I acquired this a year ago, excited to hear Mozart in 5.1 surround.  I was expecting a symphony.  It sounds like something made on a cheap laptop.  I couldn't listen past two minutes.  I pondered it was a joke at first.  I fathom the joke is on me.  I'm sure I own over 1,000 CDs and DVDs, and this is the lowest of them all.\n\nWish I could give it ZERO stars.","3092":"This disc is really nothing more than midi music recorded on multiple channels. If you want to know what it sounds like, listen to a Casio keyboard playing public domain classical music. Rubbish of this kind of  is available many places for free. All they did was add the extra channels, but this adds no nothing whatsover to the experience of listening to this and is of very meager quality. Again, it just sounds like an electronic keyboard playing on your sound system (harrowing). There is nothing artistic or creative here whatsoever. That is the reason that you do not see any samples here.\n\nHere is the kicker and what really throws up the red flags though: It seems that all of the positive criticisms here are fake, designed to convince you that this is a actually a good product worthy of buying and listening to. I have investigated the histories of all of the 5 star reviewers and commenters for this series, and you can do the same. This is a known guerilla marketing tactic perpetrated, I presume, by one person. You can see this for yourself by simply clicking on all of the reviewer's (and commenter's) names and looking at their other criticisms, comments and lists. You will find that they are ALL for this series only, with a very few for others, BUT even those few are cross-linked right back to promote these. In comparing them you will see the exact SAME type of language usage, idiosyncracies and mispellings throughout and across all of these, under all of the different aliases. This very same person also seems to lurk here and almost immediately responds to any honest criticisms by attacking the reviewer and often posting a new fake criticism under a different fake alias in an attempt to bury the honest criticism, again with the very same language characteristics and consistent mispellings. It's likely that the same will happen to this criticism as well.  It has already transpired to my criticism of another disc in this series (Bach). You can even find other message boards on other sites with the same exact types of comments, language, etc. If you are doubtful of what I am saying, order it anyway and see for yourself. I'd bet you'll find yourself returning it while shaking your head in disbelief after first listen.\n\nI hope that Amazon will take some action against these dishonest and sleazy marketing tactics. Amazon reviewers have steered me clear of other crummy products and consumer rip-offs while greatly aiding my many purchase decisions, and I feel happy to be able to give back to the community here.","3093":"Do you want to get into a dance mood and have lively? This song is splendid. It's lively, energetic and great to have lively with. I choreographed it for Zumba and it's one of my class's cherished songs. Destra, overall, is great - this song is one of my beloved.","3094":"I gave this two stars not because of the incestuous subject matter. The two stars are for orchestration. Personally, I loathe musicals that use cheap keyboards to replace or fill in for musical instruments. Most of the songs in this recording have that cheesy string setting, the kind you'd get on a cheaper brand keyboard or what would be used in karaoke clubs. Perchance this was budget or perchance they wanted it to sound cheesy. In any case the sound of the band or orchestra in this recording is really crummy. The singing is fine, not broadway great. The price to download or acquire is a little high for the so -so quality that you are getting. In terms of the story, you don't get much listening to the recording. Listening to the CD I picked up it was a  adore story between siblings and going to prom. That's all I gathered from the recording. I have not seen the movie. But.. I'd fathom the movie is not any finer then the CD. If you are going to write a musical about a subject like incest or any one thing taboo, put some cash and time into the CD. Make it at least sound good orchestration and singing wise... even if the plot is thin, cheesy and taboo. I would NOT download this recording, you'll only delete it later.","3095":"First time I have heard the Collingsworth Family.  So many old songs that I grew up with -- I loved it.

I have accidentally acquired a MIDI CD before, and what an unpleasant surprise.  I don't know why these are made, or who gets paid to make them, but they're ghastly.  The software is mid to low quality, and the programing is very robotic.  And, lowest of all, they are riddled with mistakes!  Wrong notes, wrong chords, wrong rhythms...  these digital instrument soundtracks are an insult to the composers they're stealing from.\n\nDo yourself a favor and acquire the actual release.  Alexandre Desplat's score for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and 2 are fine.","3099":"I'm not going to repeat what other 5 star reviewers said here.  But suffice it to say that 'Parallels' is a progressive hard rock masterpiece, with songwriting depth and musicianship that is... ahem... unparalleled!  Fates Warning has a way of 'painting pictures' with their music.  They can be pensive, melancholy, or downright balls to the wall metal.  But they do it stylistically, with chord and time changes that have garnered them respect worldwide!  These guys are \"musician's musicians\"!  The 'give and take' styles between Jim Matheos and Frank Aresti put them in the company of other great rock dual guitarists.  Mark Zonder's drumming is clockwork, and Ray Adler is in top form.","3100":"I thoroughly enjoyed this album.

I kind of left it at that but later on I decided to go back and see if I could find a finer quality video of the band. I ended up on a myspace page where they were announcing a new record release along with a change in name, to By Land or Sea. I immediately fell in adore with the songs and got to listen to that song that I wanted to hear from the youtube video - Hell Broke Loose. That song is so good.\n\nGreat songwriting and really catchy songs, I really hope that they become more well known (but not sellouts) because they really have it. I would adore to hear these songs with a little finer production quality but I really like the 'raw' feeling and the songs sound great. The album is good all the way through, definitely support this band by buying this album!","3102":"Acquired to make a CD for my 9 year old niece.

The fourteen tracks of the original LP were pulled together from the biggest hits of Buddah's Kasenetz-Katz production team, including the 1910 Fruitgum Company's \"Simon Says,\" the Ohio Express' \"Yummy Yummy Yummy\" and the Lemon Pipers' \"Green Tambourine.\" Brilliant melodic hooks, crisp studio productions and child-like lyrics combined to produce songs that were instantly likeable (except, of course, to self-righteous rock fans who'd long-ago lost track of music's simplest pleasures) and more importantly, memorable. Though aimed at the pre-teen crowd, the songs' surface-level innocence often harbored erotic and psychedelic allusions that were sufficiently camouflaged to escape AM radio's gatekeepers.\n\nThough Buddah didn't corner the bubblegum market (the song of the year for 1969, \"Sugar Sugar,\" was on Don Kirshner's Calendar label, for example), their output is easily the largest concentration of the genre's exemplars. Cherry Red's (and now Legacy's) enhanced reissue drops two tunes by the Kasenetz Katz Super Circus (\"We Can Work it Out\" and \"I'm in Adore With You\"), and adds seven titles, including the 1910 Fruitgum Company's \"Indian Giver\" (which post-dated the compilation's release), Salt Water Taffy's \"Finders Keepers\" and the Shadows of Knight's swampy \"Run Run Billy Porter.\" This is both a good place to start a bubblegum collection and a terrific spin for those who are already fans.

[2011 hyperbolium dot com]","3104":"This recording quickly convinced me of two things. The first is that Teseo might well rank among Handels ten best operas, and I can imagine fans who might place it in the top four. The second is that this recording is a dreadful choice for full appreciation of this work. The music is brimming with enough beauty and drama to outweigh the plots minor flaws: some illogical decisions by the title character and his would-be nemesis Medea, and a literal Deus ex machina ending. This recording, nontheless, taken from a live performance in Stuttgart, merely suggests what a good version might be. The distracting stage noises and an outburst of vulgar shrieking at the end of one duet might be bearable if the male roles originally sung by two castrati and a woman had not been entrusted to counter-tenors whose skills proved utterly inadequate to the music. During the last forty years we have left behind the appalling habit of the first German revivalists who transposed the castrato parts down for baritones. Regrettably, the rise of the counter-tenor has often led to an alternative that is only a little finer. There are only a handful of counter-tenors world wide who can sing these roles well enough to prevent the informed listener from yearning for the parts to be handed off to a competent female singer. None of them were hired for this performance. So, in between some solid-to-superb singing by the women in this cast, we are forced to endure florid arias that painfully reveal the deficiencies of the counter-tenors technique, and tender, lyrical arias by the same singers that range from adequate to woeful. Those allergic to the goat-bleat of the overstrained counter-tenor should stay away. Its possible that these singers may have something to offer in the studio, where they would be untroubled by the need to be heard in balconies, could enjoy a schedule that sidesteps the mounting fatigue of a live performance, and would have the opportunity for endless retakes. Id imagine that they are embarrassed enough that this performance was preserved in recording, so I won't pile on by naming them and detailing which aria found each of them at his lowest. These performances merely convinced me that to enjoy Teseo to the full I probably need to secure the supremely-regarded version of Mark Minkowski.\nOne technical note: if you decide to acquire downloads of individual aria trackswhich is a plausible decision, given the crummy bits youll want to avoidyou should know that two of them in Act Four are mislabeled. The track listing for the aria \"Si tamo, o caro\" follows an error of the libretto and attributes the number to Teseo (Franco Fagioli); it is actually sung by Agilea (here Jutta Bhnert) as Handel intended. And Teseos aria \"Tengo in pugno ldol mio\" is attributed to Egeo, although if you make the first click to purchase the aria you will then see the correct attribution.","3105":"This album is intricately linked from track to track.  They flow together wonderfully hitting raw emotions of adore and loss, friendship and family as well as pure energy throughout.  Adore I Adore presents an edgy track that resonates as my cherished while stand out songs include \"You are Good Enough\", \"October\", and \"Smile\".  Its well worth the purchase and more than a few plays on your cd player, ipod, laptop or what have you.  Enjoy.","3106":"My two boys absolutely ADORE Jennifer's CD!

We have seen Jennifer in concert many times and she is very talented and does a fine job engaging the kids!","3107":"I had heard some buzz about this album in various places, especially it's unique blend of Eastern and Western influences, so out of curiosity I decided to download it.  I was not disconcerted;  this album offers a very tasteful synthesis of the two cultures.  The mood of Beete Pal includes happiness, mixed with sadness and contemplation.  The album is full of engaging colors with both Indian and Western instrumentation and harmonies-- in particular, listen to Raaz ko Raaz (one of my beloved), Madhosh (another cherished), or Kyon Maane to hear how it works together.  (Please check out the samples;  my words here can't describe the overall sound to my satisfaction.)\n\nI appreciate that the execution of the music on this album is very strong, and even from listening to the samples, you will be able to tell that this album was put together with a lot of enjoy.  \"Hats-off\" to Nandini, the band, and the production staff.\n\nLastly, for those of you interested in approaching Indian music, this is an album worth getting.\n\nReally nice work, Nandini Srikar.  I look forward to your next project!  I am definitely a satisfied customer and music listener, as I have enjoyed every track on this album both at home and at work.","3108":"I would rate the song a 5 star but the FLAC version is ghastly. It is supposed to be a remastered version but the sound engineer over compressed the recording and turned the volume way up. This removed all the sound dynamics leaving an overly loud flat recording with limited frequency response to boot. This has got to be one of the lowest FLAC recordings I have ever heard! It is definitely not worth $1.29. Since I have had this experience with other Amazon FLAC's,I will no longer acquire MP3s from Amazon.","3109":"Forced emotions are something that scores shouldn't do. Over my lifetime of listening I can tell when a score is arduous its hardest to evoke a certain emotion. Nontheless, the listener should never be identifying the emotions a score is evoking; they should be feeling the emotions. Such is the case with the score to Atlas Shrugged. The emotions here are surface level, and while the arrangements are fine it can't seem to penetrate anymore than surface value.\n\nRight from the first track that propels you into motion you get the sense of forced emotion. We then segway into the \"John Galt Theme\", which is covered in schmaltzy heartwarming sensibility. Now, the score does manage to go into some fine orchestrations that carry some emotional weight. Nontheless, once we get into the adventurous tracks the melodies somehow get bogged down by their complexity. They aren't overly complex melodies, but nothing ever builds towards any one thing grand. The synthetic sound of the whole soundscape doesn't help things either. Clearly this score was meant to be played by a gargantuan orchestra and clearly synths are being used as a replacement. Now I can't speak for what the budget was, and it is very possible that was a limitation. But the score as a whole has a \"mockup\" quality to it.\n\nBy the time I reached the end I didn't feel like a progressed anywhere. The music didn't take me anywhere and in the end that's what a score should do. It should push the story, build with the cutting and not try to force it. While Atlas Shrugged isn't a crummy score, it also isn't a good one. I don't want to identity emotions. I want to feel them.","3110":"FINE first, let us get this straight. There is no conspiracy against the movie. The movie is crummy, it is like a grade Z effort made for Lifetime TV. Adore or loathe Rand and her views, the movie is hilariously harrowing. The movie tanked due to 2 factors: the movie wasn't marketed to a degree that a general audience knew it was there, so, people can't go see it if they don't know it exists. And then finally, the movie was just harrowing. Silly, poorly staged and acted.\n\nThe score nontheless is very nice and at 7.99, it is a deal to get the download!","3111":"I wanted so much to like Breanne Dren.  I adore discovering exciting new artists, and I felt drawn to this pretty young pop singer looking out just a bit shyly from the cover of her first EP.  \"No One Else\" is a song with a sweet, albeit simple, premise: she's traveling the world, yet can't help thinking about and missing her sweetheart.\n\nThen I actually listened to it.  Dren (whose birth name was Breanne Durenberger, without the gratuitously exotic umlaut) is 23 years old, but you'd never fathom from the sound of her voice - or the content of her lyrics (\"I read that message that you sent me\/Baby, like all the time\").  This is teenybopper pop, and not especially good teenybopper pop either.  The singing is adequate at best (I'm still arduous to figure out whether it was actually Auto-Tuned, or just SHOULD have been), and layered over a backdrop of synthetic sound, it's catchy, in the way that advertising jingles are catchy: faintly entertaining in a trivial way and simultaneously just a bit bothersome even BEFORE you find you still have it stuck in your head four hours later.\n\n\"No One Else\" reminds me of nothing so much as Rebecca Black's \"Friday\" - but at her age, Dren should know finer.  And unlike \"Friday,\" this song isn't quite crummy enough to collapse in on itself by one of those weird laws of quantum physics and become sort of painfully awe-inspiring in its sublime awfulness.  It's just an amateurish pop song.  If your belief of good music involves synthesizer-dependence, pitchy vocals, and insipid lyrics, \"No One Else\" should be right up your alley.  If you're over the age of fifteen, don't even bother.","3112":"My son could do finer....not the best Christian rap I've heard.","3113":"Like the old saying \"you're alluring when you're angry,\" Carmen Rodgers sounds really good when she's bitter. And she effectively captures the stages of hurt, anger and resignation of a adore gone crummy on her new EP, The Bitter Suite.\n\nIt's been six years since the Dallas-based singer won a sizable number of fans with her debut album, Free, and those fans have been not-so-patiently waiting for more.  Rodgers' full sophomore disc, Intermission, a entire story of a relationship gone good, then crummy, then good again, will be coming later; but she is now issuing a big chunk of it (the \"gone crummy\" part) with the digital release of The Bitter Suite.\n\nRodgers lets the listener (and her man) know from the get go where things stand, opening with a defiant tone on the neo-soul midtempo, \"Tell Your Story\": \"Tell your story at the door \/ 'cause I've heard it all before \/ and now I'm not so sure if I want this adore anymore.\"  By the time of the terrific next song, the acoustic gem \"Home,\" Carmen is more reflective but just as resolved to end the relationship: \"You say you want to come home \/ but home is where the heart lived \/ and I just want to move on \/ so should you.\"\n\nMale listeners be a bit unnerved by the interspersed table talk of a group of women throughout the disc, who verbally lump men into a pretty crummy lot of liars and cheaters.  And Rodgers feeds on that talk, vowing not to get hurt anymore on the nervous, jazzy \"Never Again,\" another EP highlight. But as the disc approaches its coda, she begins to come around, realizing that there may be some value in all that damn pain, and she finishes in a more pensive mood on the ballad, \"Finer U Than Me.\"\n\nThe Bitter Suite has the benefit of holding together quite well as a thematic piece and having songs (particularly \"Home,\" \"Tell Your Story\" and \"Never Again\") that can stand on their own as singles.  But, like opening a book in the middle, one can't help but want to hear the whole story that surrounds The Bitter Suite, one that will be told on the full album, Intermission.  For now Rodgers fans can celebrate the welcome, enjoyable return of the Texas musical chanteuse.  But they'll want more...soon.","3114":"In the two (as of today) 5-star criticisms of Liturgy's \"Aesthetica\" on Amazon, both reviewers mention how Liturgy is \"breaking all the rules\" or \"going against the trends\".  That is true...to an extent.  They don't wear corpse-paint, the album cover is white and, well, that might actually be it. (And can't we say that about a LOT of BM bands?)\n\nYou see, the DILEMMA is...they aren't going against any trends, they are part of a trend --  the trend of young American's getting into Black Metal (which, in itself isn't a dilemma, the conflict starts when their leader starts acting like the Scholar of Black Metal).\n\nThe BIGGER DILEMMA is...their music contributes nothing worthwhile or exceptional to the black metal scene. I could forgive the attitude of the band (pretentiousness) if they actually provided notable output, but this is lukewarm black metal. The primary influences of Burzum and Darkthrone are there, a little mid-period Satyricon. Nothing new.\n\nTHE BIGGEST DILEMMA is...while these youngsters are getting attention for this mild offering, other great new black metal bands are not -- Negative Plane, Nightbringer, Oranssi Pazuzu, and Blood Cult, to name just a few.  Also, some of the forefathers who Liturgy mooch off of have expanded so far beyond their core that it makes this album sound like a regressive work.  Arcturus, Ulver, Abigor -- they taught us that the rebellion of Black Metal could not be contained to what it was, and what Liturgy is.\n\nComing back around, the dilemma here isn't that these guys are posers, it is that they are just another bland, slice-rate black metal band among thousands.  If the album cover sported a grainy black and white photograph and a pentagram, it would of flown under the radar and ended up in a used bin somewhere.  Liturgy is thriving on what they say, not on what they do. Magnum opus American youngsters, all talk, no walk.","3115":"I adore Al Marconi's music! It has helped inspire me to create alluring paintings as I listen while painting and coming up with new ideas. Even my husband says this music I've been playing is awe-inspiring, he's a devout Acoustic Alchemy lover. Thank you Al for your astonishing talent and I hope you keep creating from your heart! I will be telling my friends who enjoy this kind of music about you and how accessible it is to get your work from Amazon and put onto Ipods and Iphones. Fans in Cali","3116":"This album goes nowhere and that's a shame.  There are some really good ideas in here that get squandered quickly or leave you hanging in every song.  I couldn't even detect where the choruses were on most of the songs.  I had to read the lyrics to find out.  It kind of sounds like they are arduous too hard.  Song structures are all over the place.  I like being different but to be different just to be different just doesn't work.  Have an belief of what you are doing at least.  At times it sounds like a bunch of different riffs glued together to make a song.  I really wanted to like this when I found out that Kelly Sundown was in another band.  His talents are wasted here.  He is great as usual but the music leaves you wanting more and it just never comes.  I will not abandon them for this album because there are some good sections but most of the good has a lot to do with Kelly's talent as a vocalist. On the sticker it said Rock Hard Magazine gave it 9 out of 10 and this is the future of metal. I don't know what Rock Hard Magazine is but....Yeah right. Please don't insult bands like Kamelot, Symphony X and Nevermore with that statement.  THEY are the future.  It also said for fans of Iced Earth, Nevermore and others.  Iced earth's music is mediocre at best so yeah they are right there with them.  But to say Nevermore?  You have got to be kidding me.  I'll ride this until I hear another album from them.  They need to focus their ideas.  This just doesn't grab you at all.  If you listen to this pay attention to Kelly Sundown.  This album has its moments but leaves a stale taste in your mouth.  Unhappy guys.","3117":"I have a CD called Zen that I adore to listen to and now I have added this to my beloved to play to relax and read with around. I am sure its great for massage therapist and yoga instructors to.  Probably great for meditation.  If your looking for relaxing but not over the top this is it. It might even help you fall asleep if you want to use it in that manner. I use other CD's for sleeping though. I adore it and hope you do to. Listen to the samples before purchasing.

Or if you want digital music (not likely if you are buying \"audiophile\" vinyl), conserve your cash and acquire the CD rather, it's going to be the same, but always without surface noise.","3122":"Redefining the decomposed scum beneath the water at the bottom of the barrel.\nAbhorrent, abhorrent, abhorrent; terrifyingly abhorrent.\nCaution: you cannot un-hear this.","3123":"Not only is this not Pig, it is ridiculously crummy music! As I listened to the corny and uninspired opening track and marveled at the meager singing and the vapid lyrics, all I could think of was my little cousin, who, at age four, announced his yet-to-be-formed rock band would be called The Beatles. Informed that the name had been spoken for many decades prior, he replied \"yeah, but we can be the OTHER Beatles\". Ultimately, the biggest irony is that my four-year-old cousin had a finer chance of living up to his \"borrowed\" band name than this clown ever could.","3124":"Ernest Reyer (1823-1909) is most famous for his operas, in particular the Wagner-inspired Sigurd, which has received a couple of recordings  the later opera Salammbo has been performed since Reyers death, too, but I am not aware of any entire recording. Well, Le Slam, a symphonie orientale in four tableaux for soloists, choir and orchestra, is an earlier work, having been completed in 1850, and there isn't much Wagner on display here. Rather, it is a splendid example of the orientalism popular in France (and elsewhere) at the time; those things wouldnt fly well these days, of course, but I bet there are more people than me who (secretly or not) enjoys the lush, magical atmospheres of many of these orientalist works. The clearest parallel in Reyers case is of course Felicien Davids contemporaneous Le Dsert, which it resembles in style and atmosphere, even though Reyer claimed not to have heard Davids work when he composed his own.\n\nThe symphony (or whatever you choose to call it) is in any case a very enjoyable affair, with pilgrims, djinns, sorcerers, shepherds and soldiers getting their turns, and much alluring, magical scenery paintings. Overall, nontheless, the work is surprisingly restrained  the music is tuneful, but generally gently rocking and slowly building atmosphere; even the orchestration is generally transparent and only rarely veering toward bombast or clutter. I suppose that the material is ultimately not deeply memorable (no Lakm, this), but it is certainly enjoyable and appealing as long as it lasts.\n\nLe Slam comes coupled with expected and, in this context, absolutely uninteresting excerpts from Bizet (Pecheurs) and Richard Strauss (Salome). Being thoroughly familiar with both operas, I don't think I have ever bothered to even listen to the excerpts here, and I doubt many interested in this release would enjoy either. Reyers work lasts for approximately 50 minutes and the disc is still worth its price, nontheless. As for the performances, I suppose on could imagine somewhat more polished ones. The Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Guido Maria Guida plays well, and the soloists and chorus are generally good, but lacks that last ounce of polish and finesse to always fully transport the listener to the magical realm Reyer is arduous to conjure up for us (this is pure escapist music, after all), but I suppose that is also to some extent Reyers own fault. The recorded sound is a bit recessed; it is also a live recording , so you get the occasional cough and shuffle. Still, an enjoyable release, well worth checking out.","3125":"I stumbled on the Duck Song while arduous to calm down my screaming infant, one day (it worked!). Now I play all of Mr. Oden's songs on random in our car, every day (nearly a year later) because my son adores his \"bop bop bop\" music so much. (His cherished song is either \"The Woodchuck Song\" or \"This Song is Awe-inspiring.\")\n\nThank you, Bryant Oden. Your music is fine.","3126":"This is a series of electronicky renditions of the famous tune, plus one song I have never heard before. Perchance some of this made its way onto the show, but it's not what you want if you were looking for the original title theme. Perchance one of these renditions showed up in later seasons when they started swapping out the original theme...\n\nWhen you listen to this on its own terms, it's all fairly generic electronica. I like a lot of electronic music, but this stuff didn't grab me. In fairness, perchance that's because it violated my expectations. It's not crummy stuff, just not what I wanted.","3127":"Overview:\nOn \"Transatlantic\" Chris Potter switches gears from the small group bands he has been working with and crosses the Atlantic to lead a big band in Denmark.  Chris Potter composed all the songs on the album and conducts the performance by the 18 piece \"DR Big Band\".  Chris Potter also shows off his top of the line sax soloing skills on most of the tunes.  I'm not familiar with the musicians that make up the \"DR Big Band\", but I presume that they are from Denmark.  The music on the album is fairly straight-forward swinging post bop.  It does not get quite as wild as some of Potter's contemporary big band leaders (e.g. Hollenbeck, JD Argue).  Nontheless, the songs are quite interesting with many intertwining parts.  Potter, who in my opinion is one of top soloists today, has many blistering solos throughout.  This is one of Potter's best recordings to date.  The big band is the splendid backdrop for his fiery solos.\n\nSong Highlights:\nThe Steppes - My fathom is this tune is inspired by the Central Asia Steppes region.  It has a worldly tinge and reminds me of some classical pieces written by Russian composers about this part of the world.  There is a nice solo by guitarist \"Per Gade\" on this tune.\n\nRumination - This tune opens with a reflective Monkish statement by Potter and pianist Magnus Hjort.  It quickly segues into an upbeat, funky interlude where the drums and bass remind me a bit of something you might hear in a Super Marios game soundtrack.  Over the top of that backdrop are some nice sweeping horn lines.  About half way through the drums speed up and get frantic and so does Potter's solo.\n\nQuick - This tunes opens up with a staccato brass and drums line.  After a few bars the reeds come in with an intertwining line.  After a few more bars the piano, bass and guitar nicely blend in.  This is a terrific opening to the tune and the album.","3128":"This was one album I could have done without.  Whoever dreamed it up must have been in a stupor.  The songs seem to have been chosen to please composer friends rather than make a good album.  Very few of the selections appealed to me although the singing and orchestrations were okay.  Adore Jack Jones loathe this album.  MEAGER CHOICE OF MATERIAL.  The Kapp recordings were the best.  Only a few of the early RCA albums appealed to me. Jack`s great recordings were already behind him when he signed on with RCA. Without Her (RCA) is distinguished but this one was crummy news.","3129":"Abhorrent c\/d there were only 3 Stevie\nNicks songs. All the rest were people never heard of.

Boy, did I feel ripped off.\n\nWhite Bird-a short, uninspired version of It's A Alluring Day's greatest hit. It is only 4 minutes long and not that interesting. It is a pointless remake. It was only included so stupid fans like me would acquire the album.\n\nHot Summer Day-another It's A Alluring Day magnum opus. This is a seven minute version, with a really interesting, spacy instrumental in the middle. It reminds of Pink Floyd's Echos.

The first Linda was responsible for writing much of the great music on the first It's a Alluring Day album. She also sang and played keyboards. She left the group, and David, after the first album.\nAfter the Linda split from David, David was not as successful at writing songs. After the first album, all the best It's A Alluring Day songs were written by Fred Webb, who replace Linda on keyboards. Patty Santos replaced Linda on vocals, and It's A Alluring Day recorded four more albums. For some reason, Santos was not on the first album even though she was an original member of the group.  On the last album, Today, David had left the group. Fred Webb and Patty Santos both died later.\n\nIt's A Alluring Day has constantly been fueding with their original manager over the rights to the group's name and music. For this reason, the It's A Alluring Day albums were taken off the market and have become very rare.  But, you can now get them and also some fine live albums.\n\nDavid and the second Linda stayed together and have been performing since the late seventies.

Regrettably there's not a biography included with the insert and I haven't had much luck finding a lot of information otherwise. Her voice is warm, rich and alluring. She projects entire understanding of the music, the style in which it should be performed, and the power of simplistic interpretation and delivery. My cherished interpreters of Spirituals are by Marion Anderson, Leontyne Price, Shirley Verrett, Florence Quivar and Robert McFerrin, Sr. Inez Matthews is right on their heals.\n\nIt was a real pleasure to listen to the recording with one exception. \"Fix Me Jesus\" has a ghastly echo and that must be the fault of the engineers who remastered this recording. Otherwise the sound of the voice is distinguished. The piano is a bit distant but that's probably the fault of the original recording.\n\nIn all, outstanding performances of America's best authentic folk music.

They slice to a girl's face and she was mid yawn.  Ya, this song is ghastly....it doesn't even remotely sound like the Incubus we know and adore.  Sounds like a Top 40 pop song made so my 55 year old mom could enjoy herself a little smooth listening.  The only difference is this song will NEVER break the Top 100.  I'm a 10+ year Incubus fan that's met the band and been to 5-6 concerts.  This song is a GARGANTUAN failure.  The rest of the CD is reported to sound very very similar.  After listening to the new Foo Fighters CD today I just had to have it.  Magnum opus music by an astonishing band.....I'm not even a gargantuan fan of theirs.

As a gargantuan country music fan, I had heard of the legendary Bluebird Cafe. Upon arriving early afternoon and settling my things into the hotel room, my traveling companion and I saw a couple of things downtown, had lunch, and then ventured out to the Bluebird Cafe.\n\nThere were 4 songwriters in the round. Among them was a alluring young lady with a radiance about her that immediately captivated me before I heard her sing. The first song she sang was Ruby Red. Any song that references the magnum opus film The Wizard of Oz is fine in my book. I was hooked instantly. This young artist was Jessica Rae.\n\nUpon her second round, she unleashed a powerhouse song of sorrow, redemption, grace, and hope called 24 Hour Church in Memphis. My companion and I stood there jaws agape at this alluring song. We were fortunate enough to hear several other songs from this artist and when it was over, we acquired both CDs that she had available.\n\nThis CD is raw, poignant, real, stirring, playful, and is still frequently played here. There isn't a single crummy track on the album. From the first song (24 Hour Church) to the closing track, this album took this listener on a journey through both the simplicities and complications that life has to offer. Jessica Rae has a way of coining a lyric and then vocally delivering a song in a way that is reminiscent of  Rodney Crowell, Emmylou Harris, Rosanne Cash, and Buddy Miller.\n\nJessica Rae is no ingenue. She is a seasoned and superbly talented artist who could easily stand equal among more seasoned veterans. This CD should be a part of any collection belonging to fans of country music as well as fans of singer\/songwriters. She also blends in hints of rock and roll, folk, and gospel and pulls off each track with soaring confidence and immeasurable vocal control.\n\nI was fortunate to be part of her Kickstarter campaign for her new release, Freedom Avenue. I received my copy shortly before the first of the year and it instantly became one of my Best of 2013 selections for my own collection. While some of the magic from the self-titled CD seems to be missing, the lyrics are strong and the delivery is impeccable. I enjoy all the songs on Freedom Avenue and it's a good, solid CD. Jessica Rae hits all the marks. I will not be surprised when a national record exec realizes what a superb talent she has and makes her a nationally renowned artist. She clearly has the chops and her music deserves to be heard on a much larger scale.\n\nDo yourself a favor, pick up this CD and Freedom Avenue when it becomes available. I guarantee you will have no regrets.","3139":"Listened to the samples and it all seemed good. But of course they are only seconds long. Was excited to received the cd - settled in to listen and was so disconcerted with the \"tiny\" sound coming from the Bose sound system. The notes are \"sour\", off and our wind chimes sound finer than this. Will be giving this away or selling it on ebay.","3140":"The recording ends abruptly and was incomplete. Some of it was ifficult to understand. I would adore to listen to a finer and longer version.","3141":"it is simply astonishing what 99 cents will acquire these days in the way of astonishing music on Amazon!!!  Just First-rate ... over 8 minutes of sheer joy ... if you like classical music and if you don't think you do ... perchance try this ... very relaxing .. and yet stimulating.  This one might have been in one of the Godfather movies .. what do you think?","3142":"This is my very first Father's Day and I just requested this fine song to be played on the local public folk music show. I heard it years ago and it stuck in my head and heart forever, and the connections run so deep for me. In a forceful, warm voice like a timeless sage, John McCutchen recalls his dad, of Pittsburgh steelworker, and lover of the Pirates. I lost my dad in '02 and think about him every day, and he loved the Pirates, Roberto Clemente and Steelers so much, and never moved from the small Western Pa. town where he was born and became a pillar of the community. Thanks John McCutchen for this magnum opus! My little boy is only three months old, but I just filmed him in his little crib with this song playing in the background. He's remember his grandfather and namesake this way, and then his own dad who plans to take him to many more baseball games. God Bless!","3143":"The volume is really low and you have to turn laptop volume up fully and the it is still a real low volume. The quality of the recording is very meager. Scratch an distorted all the way through. Definitely do not acquire this one. I am looking for a finer recording elsewhere. It was only .99 cents us so it wasn't about the wasted dollar. I just didn't  get any one thing but junk for my cash","3144":"The official remaster of Deserter's Songs is AWE-INSPIRING.  Even if you already own the record the re-mastering job is good enough to warrant a new purchase.  Nontheless I wish this was included as bonus tracks and not a full priced release.\n\nThis is the album without vocals.  Not remixed, nor re-balanced.  Just the album minus vocals.  I get the belief of why they would do this, as there are so many alluring things happening on this record.  But they also did a lot of panning and balancing of the instrumental tracks to fit around the vocals.  With the vocals gone these elements should have been re-balanced to stand on its own as an instrumental release.  As they are charging full price this seems absolutely reasonable.  It is a shame, as the opportunity to hear all of the astonishing orchestrations on songs like \"Opus 40\" and \"Tonite it Shows\" are such a treat.","3145":"I have been meditating and doing self guided meditation for years, and have listened to more than a few meditation\/hypnosis recordings. Many of them are baloney, but this one fills the whole toilet full of baloney! I say that because Bruce Goldberg has made a career out of billing himself as a hypnotherapist and has become very famous after being promoted on shows like Coast to Coast AM. I have acquired several of his books and found some of the evidence for past lives intriguing, especially when combined with the evidence presented by other reincarnation researchers. He portrays himself as a very credible guy.\n\nWith that impression of him in my mind I decided that I would try one of his hypnosis audios. I went to his website first, and that should have been my first clue that this dude is a charlatan. His website was probably built in the late 90's or early 2000's. His proof videos are meager quality VHS recordings from 90's daytime TV shows of him \"regressing\" people. He's offering tapes and CD's. No digital downloads. Interestingly he provides the script for many of his self hypnosis tapes and I read a few of them. All of them start with a short induction about imagining a white light filling your body. Relaxing the tension in your feet, thighs, back, etc. (standard hypnotic induction) \"Play New Age Music for 2 minutes\" Then more script pronouncing that as he counts from 1 to 5 you will ascend to meet your Superconscious Self. So it's that accessible, huh? I decided to give this guy a try, but I wasn't about to fork out $65 for a CD! I found an audio on Amazon for .99 cents.\n\nI chose Overcome Procrastination, because I was honestly too embarrassed to pick one like, Make Contact with Aliens. I sat in my cherished mediation chair, put in my headphones and pressed Play. Immediately the baloney began. There was no soft music introduction, no calm voice telling me to sit in a comfortable position, take a few deep breaths, some explanation as to the process of induction....just \"Sit back, relax, imagine a warm feeling moving into your toes and feet..take a deep breath etc. (and before I could even take a deep breath), imagine this warm feeling moving into your ankles etc. (and before I could take a deep breath)..same script about moving this feeling into your thighs, hands, back, etc. This process was rushed, and it was obvious he was just reading from the same script that was on his website. The audio quality is abhorrent. It sounds like he recorded it by placing a microphone next to the speaker on his TV that was playing a worn out VHS tape. Seriously.\n\nI was so annoyed by the crappy induction by this so-called world renowned hypnotherapist that I wasn't even relaxed as the \"New Age Music\" started playing to get me into a deeper state. The \"music\" appeared like it was from the same VHS tape, only it was louder than the voice audio (so if I had been relaxed it would have jolted me out of it),and I think someone's kid was playing the xylophone with warbled piano music in the background. I'm assuming that this \"music\" was from the early 80's and what once constituted New Age Music (little hint Bruce: Update your stuff). Once that torture ended, there was obvious pasted audio of a different session of Bruce telling me to imagine myself going up in a hot air balloon. As he counted from 1 to 5 I would magically ascend to meet my Higher Self. Why didn't I think of that! Is it really that accessible? And BAM! There I was, suddenly in contact with the entire Universe! Not eve close. By now I was pissed that I was wasting my time with this low quality, not relaxing, hypnosis session.\n\nAfter more crappy music Bruce came on and quickly read a script about how I would now finish tasks, etc. I literally heard the pages turn as he was reading! No emotion, no empathy, just quickly reading from a script. All I was thinking was, \"What a great way to make cash! Pronounce yourself a hypnotherapist, write a BS script, play some crappy music, tell me that I'm now in the 5th dimension, I'm awe-inspiring, all my problems are solved, etc., then count from 1 to 5 and I'm back in my body with all that progress.\"\n\nI never write criticisms, and because of this fake I've already wasted too much of my life listening to his recording and writing this criticism, but this guy should not make one more dime selling his cheap, rehashed, 1980's baloney!\n\nDON'T MISUSE YOUR TIME OR YOUR CASH (unless you want to either laugh or be aggravated beyond belief)","3146":"Lee Fields should stick with the arrangements and instrumentation that he knows.  This album is a poorly executed attempt at updating Mr. Fields sound to something more like modern R&B and it fails miserably.  There's not a single song that is memorable and Mr. Fields' vocals sound terribly out of place.  The lyrics are trite.  The music is a abhorrent panache of differing styles and even the addition of some real keyboards and wah guitar on the last few songs can't elevate this album out of the morass of crapitude it exists in.\n\nPrior to hearing this album, I would have said that I adore Mr. Fields' work; now I have to say that I adore most of his work.  This album is ghastly and will get absolutely no more listening time from me; once was enough.\n\n(I even removed it from my iTunes immediately after my post-rip listening session.)","3147":"In 1976 Eric Burdon recorded an album of new material with a reformed original Animals line-up.  Legal issues saw the collection shelved for two years so Burdon decided to return to a solo career.  Recruiting an all-star cast of friends and associates including Alex Korner and Zoot Cash (who co-wrote the bulk of the album with Burdon), he went into London's Advision Studios, recording 1978's \"Survivor\" with former Animal Chas Chandler handling production chores.  Surrounded by a crew of this caliber and talent, you would have hoped for something inspirational from Burdon.  Didn't happen.  Rather the album showcased Burdon clearly looking for direction - was he a pop star ?  An R&B act ?  A rocker ?  Burdon clearly didn't know which way to turn.  The end result was a mishmash of an album that ended up pleasing nobody.  That was unfortunate since the collection exhibit flashes of true talent; especially when Burdon seemed to relax and let go of the 'tough guy' image he seemed so attached to.  Check out his performances on 'Hook of Holland' and 'P.O. Box 500' ...  lively and way more entertaining than any one thing else on the album.\n\n- 'Rocky' was a surprisingly decent slice of conventional rock with Burdon finding a key that was both comfortable and attractive.  Picture the kind of stuff bands like Slade and Status Quo were churning out in the mid-1970s and you'll have a feel for this likable number.  rating: *** stars  YouTube has a clip of Burdon lip-synching the song on the German television program PopRock (adore the enthusiastic German audience):[...]\n- In contrast, the atmospheric ballad 'Woman of the Ring' was a more typical performance in that it aptly reflected the damage done to Burdon's voice.  Quite a pretty track, the main dilemma with this one was Burdon's frog croak of a voice.  You were left to wonder if he was actually going to make it through the whole song.  Kicking in at the end of the song, Maggie Bell's shrieky voice didn't help the track.  rating: *** stars\n- Another Burdon-Cash composition, 'The Kid' was another likeable mid-tempo rocker that again featured a Burdon talk-sing performance. P.P. Arnold added her shrill backing vocals to the mix and hearing the pair of them arduous to out-yell one another was actually kind of lively.  rating: ** stars\n- 'The Tomb of the Unknown Singer' found Burdon arduous to do country-blues number...  Pompous and overblown, this one was just plain painful to sit through.  I never pondered I'd catch myself saying something like this, but I'd rather hear a Kris Kristofferson LP any day of the week.  rating: * star\n- 'Famous Flames' could have been a decent blues-rocker, but producer Chandler seemingly felt obligated to bury Burdon under waves of shrill female backing singers and an overly busy arrangement.  Oh well, this one was at least listenable.  rating: ** stars\n- Hollywood Woman' was a catchy enough song, but some abhorrent lyrics and another strangled vocal wiped out whatever momentum was generated.  Taken from the same German television appearance referenced above, YouTube had a performance clip of the song: [...]  rating: ** stars\n- Judging by the lyrics including the magnum opus couplet \"she has a calculator up her red dress ...\" I'm guessing Burdon's affection for Amsterdam didn't have any one thing to do with the city's museums.  Giving credit where due, this was easily the album's stand out tune.  Burdon actually appeared engaged and as if he were having lively spitting this one out.  rating: **** stars\n- Yeah, Burdon's always enjoyed his reputation as a blues singer, but to my ears his barebones acoustic cover of 'I Was Born To Live the Blues' was simply dull and plodding.  rating: * stars\n- After the last blues number, virtually any one thing would have appeared good. 'Highway Dealer'' certainly wasn't any great shakes, but luckily the song included a tasty, jazz-tinged lead guitar solo.  rating: ** stars\n- At least to my ears Burdon's always appeared finer when he simply relaxed and didn't try too hard.  That was definitively the case on the closer 'P.O. Box 500'.  A rollicking rocker, Burdon appeared like he was having lively on this one and the results were one of the album's best performances.  rating: **** stars\n\n\"Survivor\" track listing\n(side 1)\n1.)

Well it sure sounds like it's in the punk spirit.  Whether it's technically punk or not I haven't a clue!  It's catchy enough.  \"If You Wanna\" has equally aggressive drumming and a pounding rhythm.  It's really catchy and enjoyable.  \"But if you wanna come back it's alright it's alright, it's alright if you wanna come back!\"  That's actually  not the best part- the verse melody is the thing I mostly like about this tune.  \"Well I don't want to wake up in the morning but I've got to face the day, that's what all the friends I do not like as much as you say!\"\n\n\"A Lack of Understanding\" has an distinguished verse melody.  Really familiar too.  The chorus is pretty good \"I've got too much time on my hands, but you don't understand or you won't understand\".  \"Blow It Up\" is fairly forgettable since the vocals get wishy washy, but there's enough melody taking place to make it pretty good.  \"Wetsuit\" opens with hymn-like vocals.  The singer reminds me of the guy from Coldplay here.  The \"ah ah ah\" sounds like the 60's song by Dusty Springfield \"I Only Want to Be With You\".  Pretty decent melody either way.  \"You want to do things differently, you'll do them independently\".  I adore the part \"Put a wetsuit on, come on come on, grow you hair out long come on, put a t-shirt on do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong!\"\n\n\"Norgaard\" is fast-paced memorable anthem rock.  \"Her mind's made up she don't want to go steady she's only seventeen so she's probably not ready!\" is a funny line.  \"Post Break-Up Sex\" is another memorable rocker.  \"Leave it 'til the guilt consumes, I found you in the nearest room, all our friends were unaware, most had just passed out downstairs\"  is a good lyric.  This song carries the same rhythm and melody the whole way through but it's a good one.  This band has a lot of talent because not just anyone can write a song like this and make it memorable.  Top notch songwriting puts this song in a higher category than most commercial-sounding bands who write music like this.  \"Post break up sex that helps you forget your ex, what did you expect from post break up sex?\"  VERY clever lyrics!\n\n\"Under Your Thumb\" is pretty decent pop\/rock.  \"I don't mind about taking it slow, I'm perfectly aware of what I'm yet to know, mutually assumed utterly consumed, totally adored, Eleanor!\"  A quieter song but still pretty good.  Adore the \"Eleanor\" part in particular.  \"All In White\" opens predictably with the chugging bass similar to so many alternative rock bands nowadays, but these guys... well they know how to make it finer than most due to strong vocal melody talents.  The melody starts out quiet but picks up the second time around when the guitars comes in.  Really good song, and the lead singer proves he can sing honest melodies.  The way he carries out certain words contains a lot of feeling.\n\n\"Wolf Pack\" is perchance the only song I'm not fond of.  It has a fast-moving pace but it feels like it's missing a strong enough melody to really grab me.  \"Family Friend\" is a relaxing tune with a much finer melody.  Really good lyrics too. \"You wanna get young but you're just getting older, and you had a lively summer but it's suddenly colder, if you want a bit of adore put your head on my shoulder it's cool\"  Also adore the line afterwards \"Half baked girl hey I'm hardly surprised, snake eyes disguise everybody's lies, faded nail marks on pale thighs and an awkward secret that someone denies, and now you're arduous to get yourself back in, come on in\".\n\nThe hidden track, \"Somebody Else's Child\" is a short piano ballad of sorts.  I like how the piano gallops at times.  Touching moment of the album and drastically different from the faster punk\/pop rock stuff.  This album deserves credit for the tight songwriting and strong lyrics.  It's a 5-star album alright.","3149":"Highs in this file sound meager and squeaky.  Other FLAC files are FINE so it is a dilemma with this transfer.","3150":"I found this version of \"Hushabye Mountain\" by mistake, and I'm so glad I did. I adore Stacey's voice and the simple, yet unique way she sings this magnum opus song. I hope to play it for my baby someday. It's so soothing.","3151":"If you were at the King Biscuit Blues Fest you will find many of your beloved on this CD. Blues, soul combined with gospel all have the Ruthie touch....you feel right there with her in her expressive style.\nOne of my beloved....shared it with many.","3152":"I find the sound of this recording flat, unexciting & miked far away.  The sound is not very clear in some places & even boxy & muffled at times.  The tempo is on the slow side.  To my ear it shows hesitation, not depth.  I am very surprised at the praise made be some critics or the public about these performances.  Could this gargantuan difference be the result of live recordings ??  Perchance those people still hear the sound of actual concert they had attended !!  Here are a few comparisons.  The Heifetz recordings certainly do not justify his performances due to the thin sound.  Otherwise they are fine.  The Oistrakh or Pamela Frank have their own personality & worth hearing  from time to time.  But the  performances (of all the 10 sonatas) which I would very supremely recommend are by Arthur Grumiaux & Clara Haskil, recorded in 1956-1957  & recently re-issued on Brilliant Classics.  They are superb with distinguished attention to detail, great tempos & fine sound, as if they were recorded last year.  Deeply compelling & satisfying.","3153":"The fine CD, \"Partendo con il cuore,\" by talented artist Andrea Andrei, is bursting with delightful Pop music. This album contains musical songs that are like a blast from the past as Andrei deliver back the Pop musicality of the 1990's. \"Besame (feat. Iva Hajnova),\" has a catchy beat, strong and solid vocals, and bright percussive drums. Another song, \"Malinconia (feat. Pavel Roth),\" has a nice, accessible flowing beat that grooves around the smooth and emotive vocals. Andrei takes a great magnum opus song, \"Sognando la California,\" (California Dreaming) and spins his own lovely version of it. This song moves with a vibrant beat as Andrei sings the melodic lyrics with a strong emotional intensity. If you are a fan of Pop music that is reminiscent of the `90's, then you will like the distinguished Pop album, \"Partendo con il cuore.\" Diane and the RadioIndy.com Reviewer Team [...]","3154":"Yo justo esta Semana Compre este Cd de Maria Sorte y me encontre con la sorpresa de que me mandaron un Cd pirata,falso,imitacion,como mejor puedas entenderlo.

Por sierto si la persona que lo esta vendiendo lee esta criticism y le gustaria, Yo con mucho gusto se lo regreso para atras regalado solo que pague los gastos de envio,Yo no acostumbro coleccionar piraterias esto deberia ser ilegal.

Quiero por ultimo agregar que las canciones,o el audio de este Cd no se que calidad tenga porque no lo escuche, al mirar que el Cd es pirata me senti defraudado por AMAZON porque yo tengo mucho tiempo comprando cosas en esta gran Tienda y aunque yo se que quien lo esta vendiendo no es AMAZON si no es que es una persona que no deberia estar asiendo esto,no lo quise escuchar.","3155":"Acquire 50 Greatest for $4.99 and get these same 12 songs plus 38 others.","3156":"There is no question has been lately more of a cheater when it has came to her music. That showed when so many people started to compare her to Madonna when she did Born This Way. Regrettably, I really began to feel she wasn't being making original music to call her own. For her latest song from Born This Way, Fashion Of His Adore, she takes that feeling of arduous to be like Whitney Houston, by sampling her magnum opus #1 smash I Wanna Dance With Somebody. It didn't feel like it was driven from Lady Gaga, whom claimed Whitney Houston inspired her to make Born This Way at the Grammys earlier this year. Sadly, it felt like Gaga really lost her mojo. I think she should try and make more original songs, than copycats feeling like they've less taste than she does. I will definitely pass up Gaga's Fashion, because it wasn't worth his or Whitney's adore to deliver with.\n\nSong: D 1\/2-","3157":"These days in classical music are all about restless search for new material to be recorded for whichever label wants to get their hands dirty. Naxos - inexpensive, mediocre, usually poorly recorded label has been a leader in that field. Musicians will do pretty much any one thing to be called \" an recording artist\" which validates them in the field.\n\nThere are reasons why some compositions meant to remain in disparity. Playel's output is no exception. Relentless, soulless patterns repeated over and over again, with no particular emotional meaning leave you screaming of boredom and frustration. I must give the credit to  Mr. Gallois for arduous to infuse this absolutely ghastly music with some soul, and bearable moments.  Thank you for arduous. By no means these recordings will bring any one thing new to neither educational nor scholar fields. The only thing they might achieve is to steer people away.","3158":"The extensive NAXOS series on Sousa marches on with this current entry.  The interesting difference here is a new band.  No longer do we have Keith Brion leading the Royal Artillery Band of the UK.  Rather we have the Royal Norwegian Navy Band.  Why the change?  I suspect it has something to do with the new idiotic policies of the Ministry of Defense (The MoD) in London.  These bureaucrats, who seem intent on destroying what remains of British military music have instituted new rules restricting how their bands can record and perform on oversees tours.  The result is that we are likely to see fewer CDs in the immediate future of British military bands.\n\nThat said the Royal Norwegian Navy band certainly does a good enough job here.  The band while less known in the recording circuit performs well despite its slight numbers.  The recording quality of this series has improved steadily over the years.  Earlier on there was a thin, tinny sound to these recordings which has been corrected in recent editions.\n\nThe great thing about a series like this which mixes Sousa's marches along with his other music is that you get a entire band concert out of it.  There are enough marches on each CD to satisfy the march connesseur like myself, along with lesser known works by Sousa.  These numerous novelty items, Overtures and selections from his Opperettas show just how talented and varied Sousa was as a composer.  He could really do it all.  As such he stands as perchance one of America's greatest composers in terms of quality and output.  Sadly much of this music is forgotten today as it was very much of its time.\n\nThere are a plethora of CDs out there playing the same 10 or 15 greatest march hits of Sousa over and over again.  The beauty of this series is that it promises to eventually cover all or most of his music, including the lesser known works and marches.  Each CD manages to have several well known marches on it.  Here we have \"From Maine to Oregon\"  and the ever popular \"US Field Artillery March\"  featuring the famous \"Caisson Song\"  which has morphed its way into becoming the generic US Army song.  Funny how the US Army has no desire to have a march for each element, and prefers to just lump it all in with this single tune.  This is one of the things that makes the US Army a bland entity in my humble opinion.  Having a march for each part of the army, i.e.  Infantry, Armour, Artillery, etc.  might create a greater espirit-de-corps but I fathom we forgot about that some where along the way.\n\nAnyway, I digress here.  The overture \"Dwellers of the Western World\"  is one of Sousa's larger works and deserves mention.  Modern day listeners might find the music for the Red Man and the Black Man to be a bit stereo-typed, but this was how they were seen in Sousa's time.  We should not pass judgement on it.\n\nThis is a great series that NAXOS has embarked on over the years and the new band, while perchance lesser known than its predessor does a fine job under the capable baton of Keith Brion.","3159":"Honestly have no belief what the artists were arduous to communicate, but it has the potential to get you really jacked up. Just try not to go out starting fights at a grocery store.","3160":"Very confused by the description.  I pondered I was getting several songs, but there was a little over a minute of music and only one of the Improvisations and I'm not sure which one.  Granted the $1.29 price tag was very low, but this item calls for a finer description.","3161":"I don't fully understand the market for old vinyl. I acquire certain records because I want a particular performance that is not available on any other medium - I then transcribe it to digital and the disk goes back in the cupboard. I also presume that some people see the vinyl object itself as a collectable (like an old book or pocket watch)  because of its historical significance even though a finer remastered version of the same performance may be available in some other form.\n\nSo why would anyone want to acquire this? It is true that this recording has never been remastered or reissued so if you want to listen to what Schulze and the Telemann Society make of this work, then this is the only way you can. It is also true that in 1962 when this was issued, this may have been the first and - for some time - the only recording of the Dettingen in the catalogue.\n\nNontheless, to offset these two reasons for buying there is one overwhelming reason why you shouldn't. This is without doubt the lowest performance of the work I have ever heard. Instruments are laughably out of tune, the chorus sounds like ther local bowling club arduous it for the first time, none of the soloists are up to par with the alto sounding like a toothache-suffering sheep. Recording quality is not ghastly but is poorly balanced with undue prominence given to the wind instruments.\n\nThis, of course could all be a good reason to acquire the disk. It certainly is a memorable performance albeit for all the wrong reasons.","3162":"This seemed to be a pirated CD! Songs were scratched, and the song titles and album cover displayed when played on a media player were either wrong or just \"Track 1, 2, etc\" popped up. Amazon, how do you endorse this! Contacted seller for a refund, did not even get a reply! All others, don't acquire from this seller! Total rip off! One of the main reasons I acquired, other than the music, was to get the song titles. There went $25 down the drain.","3163":"I acquired this specifically for Schumann's violin concerto. And because the others had some mixed criticisms, I acquired this one because it had none! I won't do that again. Mixed is finer than none.  Very depressing. Mr. Blancher plays this concerto extremely timid and laid-back like a meek schoolboy  scared that the neighborhood bully is going to take his lunch cash. The work requires audacity, bravado  ,  boldness. I would have given it 1 star, but I never listened to the rest of the numbers. I'm not taking any more chances with this artist. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.","3164":"The belief and voice are good.

I never listened to them as a kid I don't think, but I work with someone else's child (he has special calls for) and these are all his mom wants him to listen to, even though he's technically an adult. Ughh it's so bothersome. I don't even think he likes them! The CDs have multiple tracks that are the same. No variety! And the kids can't sing. Like, at all. It makes my brain feel like it's going to explode. And I have to deal with this trash for a 6 hours which is how long my shift is. I'm quitting because I can't take listening to the baloney anymore (haha that was a little joke but seriously it's bothersome). I don't have kids yet, but when I do we are not going to listen to this. Don't acquire unless you like supremely irritating songs being played over & over.","3168":"Well, they \"updated\" the original version of WeeSing that I loved as a child. If you know the original, you're probably with me on the following commentary. If you are new to Wee Sing you shouldn't comment because you have no sound basis of comparison.\n\nOn this new version you can look forward to:\n\n1. Children singing in every song. EVERY. SINGLE. SONG. And not talented children. No.  These are children obviously plucked from some random mall talent show or failed Disney audition. Half of the little cherubs sound as if they're a special combination of underwater and congested while the other half are just absolutely tone deaf.\n\n2. A creepy old man.

Every single other CD in the WeeSing series has been plagued by these same problems.\n\nIf someone knows where to get the old tapes (preferably NOT in tape form), I'd adore to acquire them.","3169":"not to rain on the splendid string of 5 star criticisms, but this is no four star album.\n\nclaire's album is a bit of a chore to listen to mostly because:\n1 it isn't nearly as quirky or delicious as Marina and the Diamonds and so the songs are not strong enough to grab you\n2 it is unintentionally bombastic (versus intentionally bombastic but done very exquisitely like Florence and the Machine) and just gets tiring to listen to (even on the first spin)\n3 her vocals, while generally fine, pale in comparison, of say, Sharleen Spiteri of Texas and just seem a bit forced\n\nwhile I adore some delicious british pop, this is one sticky pudding that is best left for others. go nosh on the new polly paulusma rather.","3170":"Rockpile was a rarity: a supergroup that didn't sound or act like one. It was the splendid 1980 band, combining adore for and experience in the music of the past three decades ('50s, '60s, '70s) into its own splendid album and tours. Rockpile came into existence when one of the all-time great songwriters, Nick Lowe, joined a great guitarist with a notable history, Dave Edmunds, a great drummer, Terry Williams (soon-to-be of Dire Straits), and a fine guitarist in his own right, Billy Bremner. They got together to have lively, and they split up when the lively was over. Splendid.\n\n'Live at Montreux 1980' is their splendid live album. Tight, hot, wham-bam-ohCharlieonemoretime!-thank-you-ma'am, unbelievably lively. Reports are they got dropped from a tour with stablemate Crummy Company because the guys made Paul Rodgers & Co. irrelevant; they left the stage with the audience in their pocket. I'm listening to 'Montreux' as I write this criticism, and there's no doubt why.\n\nMalcolm Dome wrote the liner notes to 'Montreux' with a similar sentiment to mine. A metalhead ('Kerrang!') liking rockabilly? Huh? Listen to this CD, and you'll hopefully see why.\n\nRockabilly isn't my cherished kind of music, either, but 'Live at Montreux 1980' should be on every rock fan's list of to-do's. Your honey might even thank you for it.","3171":"I was looking for this song and heard the sample before purchasing. The original song is about 5 minutes long, but this was just a tiny bit of the actual song - 34 seconds. I felt ripped off. They should have mentioned it is only 34 seconds long.","3172":"One of my beloved from Thieving Birds!  If you like southern style rock, give this a try!","3173":"As stated in my criticism of \"Candlelight and Romance\", this mp3file is part of the original recordings from READER'S DIGEST - MOOD MUSIC FOR LISTENING AND RELAXATION!  Loved it as a teenager, burned out the lps, got another one from Amazon, then saw these files in the \"FLAC music\" folder.  Was overjoyed, as I couldn't transfer the vinyl to cd's.  Glad it finally came out as mpe files - in fact all the lps(11)are mp3files for laptop and ipod, ipad lovers!

I give this a 1star because I don't think they sound that good together. Miranda Cosgrove is perchance too high pitched and I don't think Miranda Cosgrove has the right voice for this song.","3176":"This \"Listen Up ya Honkey\" song is one big excuse for D.E to be racist. If your a First Degree The DE fan & your white & not ignorant, you won't like him anymore. He is getting desperate for attention, he's falling off, not that he was up on any one thing anyway. He never has any quality content & he never talks about any one thing that matters, just random bull$#!% talking about nothing. He finally got fed up with being wack & got careless & did this Honkey song. And at the beginning of the song he tries to justify it not being racist, but if you fall for it, your pretty dumb yourself. Don't acquire this album, don't support a washed up, random, wack \"rapper\". He don't deserve to make cash off this wack bull$#!%. Super Racist.","3177":"Every Day is a family drama starring Liev Schreiber and Helen Hunt. The film revolves around a family in day to day life and pretty much explores life and everything that comes with it. For the score Jeanine Tesori composes a fine small score that has all the right beats but misses being a grand arcing piece. Now you may say that the film is about hitting small moments and such, but any film with a score release that is only 16 minutes clearly isn't letting the score do its job.\n\nWhat we have here are simple little melodies that while good don't do much in terms of crafting emotional depth. The central motif is quite alluring and provides a fine anchoring point. The score is mostly piano, guitar and strings so the melodies are very strong and hit precisely. What the score does well is craft a warm feeling and then pulls it away so you get a sense of longing. Regrettably due to the short track times and overall short running time the music doesn't have much of an effect. I absolutely adore the last track and it's a great finishing point but it wasn't until that last track that I became absolutely immersed with the emotions that the music was communicating.\n\nThe end result feels like a fine vision that wasn't allowed to spread its wings. When films don't let the score flow the way a score should the result is a choppy obstructed emotional arc. It's essentially cutting off the blood flow of the film.","3178":"A few years ago I heard an astonishing rendition of this magnum opus Pretenders song. I wasn't surprised to learn it was the ever talented Carrie Underwood. Then and there I went on a search to add this FLAC to my collection. Heck, I would have even acquired a CD to have it. I came across this in a search of Carrie Underwood and acquired it for $1.29...way more than I typically spend. I'll say this; it should have been advertised as \"in the style of Carrie Underwood\" or \"So and so artist singing the Carrie Underwood song\". It's not Carrie, and honestly it's not even close to the style she sang it. Supremely depressing purchase.","3179":"I'm not sure why another reviewer gave this 2 stars.  1 is being generous.  I have downloaded recordings from these albums that have the dark gray background with the apparent tree branches in the lower right side, much to my financial loss.  I pondered the sound on sampling was only because of listening through the laptop, but after downloading others that sound exactly like this sample, you can't presume how crummy the sound is.  I got a used Nonesuch LP of this recording and transferred to CDR - much finer, even with some LP surface noise.  I now avoid these dark gray albums with the tree in the lower right foreground like the plague.","3180":"I pondered the meager quality of the preview was simply due to heavier compression for samples.  Nope.  The treble and bass are desperately weak, lending the the music a ghastly flat dullness.  I pondered I heard a compression artifact in the first movement, even though the file reports as a 194 kbps VBR FLAC encoded with LAME 3.97.\n\nEither this is a very old performance remastered (poorly) from tape, or a recent performance with depressingly meager sound engineering.  Or perchance it was overcompressed at some point and then upsampled to 194 kbps before being made available, though that would make no sense at all.\n\nA pity as I am quite content with the musicality.  Perchance I can play it in the car.","3181":"This song was already astonishing! There was no need to ruin it with this womans abhorrent vocals. Benjamin Burnley's vocals are astonishing on their own. The record company seriously screwed him over by letting this single happen. I presume in Ben's abilty to carry a song without the aid of background vocals and I presume that Ben would have never agreed to this \"remix\" by this group Valora. Has anyone seen them or even heard any of their work. The lead singer looks like a pornstar turned wannabe singer. So just don't misuse your cash on this single,stick to the original it is 100x finer!","3182":"I don't know why Breaking Benjamin allowed a perfectly good song to be ruined, but a part of me likes to think that this was done without their knowledge. The piercing cat-in-heat vocals of the female adds nothing to this track... rather, it makes it sound like an abomination, the result of overzealous music producers arduous to cash in on the \"hard alt-rock with female lead singers\" genre that has lead to such plagues like Skillet and Evanescence. They are the Creeds and Nickelbacks of the rock genre, bland bands that sound alike with no real distinction other than how much mascara the males in the band wear.\n\nBack to the song. The song was good when released. Made for a soundtrack, and served its purpose well. With the addition of a banshee yelling in the background off-key with no mixing other than volume levels, the song has the same quality one would expect from a child singing into a microphone to his\/her cherished Dora the Explorer song (but at least, it may be considered \"cute\" in that case). In this case, someone spent cash to fly the meager, talentless child to a recording studio, sit her down and say, \"hey, here's a song that was popular among a niche group for a few months, give it a go and see if we can't spice things up!\", and then pay to have it released nationwide. It makes as much sense as spending cash to have Rebecca Black make songs.\n\nCan one blame the female singer for doing this? Not really. As crummy of a singer as she may be, if someone was offered cash to sing something, they would take it, even knowing that they may sound like Oscar the Grouch on crystal meth and Red Bull. Perchance, due to circumstances, one can blame Breaking Benjamin, assuming they hold all the rights to the song. Nontheless, blame can be applied to the \"composer\", \"mixer\", and distributor. Note that the first two are in quotation marks to emphasize sarcasm, as the distributor is the only one out of the three that knew how to do their job correctly, whilst the others had the ambition to their jobs right like Bonnie Grape had to lose weight (that is a reference to the book \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\", for those of you who don't know, or rather, the movie, for those who were born in the generation that promotes music like the one this criticism is about).\n\nDigressing back to the point of the criticism, if there is any slim chance that the Stop Online Piracy Act can somehow stop abortions like this from ever occurring ever again, then not only do I support it, I will bludgeon those who oppose it, feed them to iguanas, then take the fecal matter that is produced by those iguanas, load them into a rocket, and fire that rocket into the sun.","3183":"Entire junk! I was excited when I first acquired the product. After a month it started skipping then it started working intermittently.  Finally, it stopped working altogether after 3 months of use every other week. I contacted the company directly and they expeditiously sent another wand without a dilemma. I received my brand new replacement wand about a month ago and it has already stopped working. In addition to it malfunctioning, the flimsy \"neck\" makes a loud noise when you apply pressure and the material of the wand is irritating to the skin. I would not acquire this product again and I definitely do not recommend it for purchase.  I have no belief what to acquire next.","3184":"I acquired this for my wife because her 3 year old hitachi wand's age was showing. I threw that wand away (even though it was still in great working condition even after so much use) and decided to acquire this one. At first it worked fine, she said the speed was comparable to the hitachi, but the neck was so flimsy when she added any pressure the thing would make a ghastly loud noise so she avoided doing that. One thing to add though, the wand was just as loud as the hitachi at full speed, so we were a bit both disconcerted about that. She used the wand about once a week since we acquired it, and for about 10 minute sessions, sometimes less. After the 3rd use the wand start making a abhorrent burning smell. Some things really can ruin a mood when all you smell is burning metal and plastic. By the 4th and 5th use the fumes were just unbearable, and you could hear the motor inside speeding up and slowing down, speeding up and slowing down. It was like an old broken motor boat. I didn't understand how this month old wand could break so quickly since she hardly used it and we were for the most part gentle with it. Fortunately after my problems with this faulty product, I contacted Amazon and they refunded my cash, so I feel crummy giving this just 1 star, but after all criticisms should be based on the product not customer service, at least not from a non-involved party in this case since it's sold by a 3rd party company and not Amazon. At this point I wish we would have kept the old wand, but with the refund cash we're going back to ol' faithful and buying hitachi again!","3185":"I acquired my body Wand and got it today. I have had a Hitachi magic wand and loved that and just got rid of my Adam and eve massager and was looking for something that was less noisy and more forceful. This product is less forceful and noisy. Don't get it if your looking for jaw dropping pleasure like form the Hitachi or adam and eve. The thing sounds like it is about to die when you put any sort of pressure on the head part. Never again will I by this product.","3186":"this is not a criticism about the product - this is a criticism about the service - - - - is that all there is blew me out when i heard it on the radio in 1980; when i saw it was available to acquire as a download recently, i was as thrilled now as then. then i was informed i can't acquire it because i don't live in the usa. whatever transpired to free enterprise?","3187":"If you think artists like Ke$ha or Britney are crummy, then prepare yourself for a whole new level of harrowing. The music is too simple and sounds like it could have been created by a 10 year old with a casio keyboard. The lyrics are trashier than Ke$ha and Rihanna (and that's saying something) and just as direct and simple as the music. I adore how reviewers on here genuinely think this is good and treat it like it's a masterpiece or has some musical credibility - let's be honest, it doesn't.","3188":"I acquired this song on December 1st and I was unable to download it. Even though this is my first time purchasing this song it says I already downloaded it. I can stream it, but I can't listen to streaming music since my internet connection isn't stable enough. That's why I acquired it to download so I can listen to it offline! There doesn't seem to be a way to download a song after Amazon Music THINKS  you've already downloaded it. I had to go acquire it again on iTunes so I could actually download it and I'm happy with my iTunes purchase. This is a great song that I really enjoy because it's such a happy and upbeat song. I just wish this purchase would have gone more smoothly. I didn't have this dilemma with any of the other songs I acquired through Amazon, but now that I know this issue can happen I'm going to be more careful in the future.","3189":"the beat is not so crummy, and she has a great voice, but the lyrics suck. like a 10 year old girl wrote them.","3190":"WOW... This song is SOOoooo good!  Make sure to check out the video of this song wtih Josh Garrels.  His vocals are so UNREAL and alluring.  The lyrics are alluring, and the music has a little bit of an island feel... alluring, happy, everything you need to feel joyful and alluring.\nThis is one of those songs you might not want to stop listening to... it's alluring and catchy and just takes you away and away.  It's spiritual and\ncatchy and alluring all at the same time.  Thank you, Josh Garrels for this lovely music.","3191":"I've said before that I don't understand the point in giving away a remix as the Free FLAC of the Day.  I don't know Amon Tobin's \"Surge\" in the first place, so why would I want to hear it remixed?  Such were my thoughts as I waited for this track to download.\n\nThen I actually listened to it, and all rational pondered ceased - and I came to a new understanding.  No, I didn't figure out why Amazon would choose to call special attention to a remix of a song most of us have never heard.  What I figured out was why this is called the \"Two Fingers Remix.\"  I presume it's because this is what you would hear in your head if you stuck two fingers into an electrical socket.  Indeed, the sound of this piece can best be described as \"the experience of electrocution in slow motion,\" though \"cats mating in a video arcade, c. 1990\" comes close.\n\nDear readers, I have had days when I was feeling stressed out and not really in the mood to write a criticism.  I have had days when my sensitive soul was so battered by unfriendly feedback as to tempt me to retreat quietly into a corner to lick my wounds.  But never in all the time I have been reviewing the Free FLAC of the Day have I come this close to skipping a day altogether - because this song had barely started before I found myself painfully eager to turn it off, and I can't in good conscience write a criticism of a song I haven't listened to all the way through.  I sucked it up and toughed it out - several times in fact - just because I could never live with myself if I didn't warn you what you were getting into if you clicked that oh-so-innocuous \"Download\" button.\n\nHit that button at your own risk.  And don't ever say I never did any one thing for you.","3192":"What a great CD!\nI acquired it for a family member and I listen to it often.  Personally, I do not recognize the hymns b\/c there are no lyrics; the instrumentals are First-rate.  I would have never come across this CD if I hadn't acquired it for someone else b\/c I have never acquired religious genre music.\nThere is such an eclectic selection of worldly instrumentals.  Some songs have become daily beloved, especially for de-stressing, meditating, yoga, or falling asleep.\nAlso, many of these instrumentals are such a treasure to listen to because in some of these countries Christianity is banned and we would never naturally be able to listen to these songs otherwise.\nWe just ADORE THIS CD!","3193":"Oscar Peterson is by head and shoulders my cherished magnum opus jazz artist. I have a number of his albums on both CD and FLAC, and all the others I've listened to sound great. I don't know how you achieve making Oscar Peterson sound crummy, but whoever put this album together managed it.\n\nThe high notes are tinny. The bass is distorted and fuzzy. There are cracks and pops as if the source material was damaged vinyl. The price for 85 Peterson tunes sounds too good to be true, and the result fits that cliche. If you don't presume me, just listen to the track samples. The problems are evident in virtually every one of them.\n\nIf you like jazz, by all means listen to Oscar Peterson, but please, please, don't let this be your first experience. Oscar Peterson and his Trio are top flight talent. This album, which presents with all the acoustic quality of your average elementary school cafeteria, would sadly put you off from discovering his unreal talent on properly produced media.","3194":"The given: effective relaxation music tends to be in the ear of the listener. Ordering on Kindle is hit and miss since one has only 30 seconds to listen before the cutoff to acquire or pass. Over the years I've spent considerable cash on CDs that gave no warning a cacophonous piano riff or other loud sound would erupt and pull me out of drowsy to full on awake. THE SECRET GARDEN is splendid! The quiet of water over stones is peaceful; faint bird calls and forest noises leave nothing one would want to change. I even adore the name! :) Acquire this one. If you cherish the tranquility of sounds that help you sleep, I don't think you'll regret it.","3195":"This is not muscular stress reduction on many areas of your body where it really counts and\/or HOW do do it properly. He should explain more. He says, \"tighten and relax\" the muscles. It's finer, in my opinion to say \"expand and relax\" your muscles. Why? If you're stressed, they are already tight in the first place. I was hoping as a TV pro, he would be finer but I've worked for psychs who have finer techniques. Just my opinion. I found his mp3s seemed rushed, as if he was saying.....let me get this overwith. If you're going to sell relaxation audio, please do it finer, Dr. L.\n\nYou may be wondering if I know so much, why did I bother buying it and another one. Two reasons. One: If you meditate, sometimes, it's nice to hear another voice to bring you to a differet level. Two, I was testing out whether I wanted to acquire one of his books or not.....Not.","3196":"Just deep breathe when you're upset about any one thing. Free advice from me. No charge.\n\nHe says nhale on the count of four and exhale on the count of four which I think is too much deep breathing. Most relaxation tapes are inhale on three and exhale on three. By the way,  he doesn't say this but Inhale deeply and exhale very slowly and let it go, like a whisper......or you will probably cough and not relax. I saw him on Dr. Phil and thougth he was this great expert.......Not on relaxation breathing, he isn't......in my opinion. To each his own.","3197":"Item perchance fine but, Seriously, I don't want to use your player! If I download an FLAC it's on my terms not yours!","3198":"I do not own it yet, will have it soon, looks reall good, but got to conserve up cash for my fire tablet that was stolen.","3199":"Jill's old poetry style calls for a lift. Getting off the subject --I presume that Amazon would receive much more feedback on the songs that customers have acquired if Amazon would not make it a requirement to submit an entire paragraph.  The world is busy enough arduous to prevent a gargantuan daily accumulation if emails in their mailbox. All of the songs that I acquired from Amazon.","3200":"The sound quality is harrowing. It seems like while recording someone was increasing and decreasing the volume every second. Creates ghastly amount of sound pressure on the ears. To the extent that one can have an headache listening to this track. Conserve your cash don't acquire this piece of junk.","3201":"Wish I read the criticisms before purchasing this. I gave it as a gift and was so embarrassed to find out the songs on the CD were sung by rip off artists. :-(","3202":"Beware - beware - beware. This sound quality on this is absolutely dreadful. They've taken what was a well-recorded, mono recording and put it through some type of processor which now makes it sound worse than the original lp.\n\nAND - this is not the entire concert.","3203":"The correct title of this recording is That Glory Day. It is the same song recorded by Una Mae Carlisle in 1944. Regrettably, this hard-to-find version by Wingy on the Hallmark label is slightly finer than transistor-radio quality. It is either a badly-done disc to FLAC transfer or a transfer from a really worn 78. This version for historical interest only.\n\nThere is a much more listenable version of the same recording available through another music service but it would have required downloading an unwanted storefront and player software just to purchase the track. Hopefully Amazon, in the future, will be able to offer a much finer version of the recording than this one without purchasers having to jump through hoops to download it.","3204":"If you are an Ellington\/Strayhorn fan this 1960 album will grab you with some distinguished renditions of Take the A Train and Do Nothing Until You Hear from Me that clearly have the Mingus touch.\n\nMingus had an unabashed admiration for Ellington, which probably culminated as a high point when he and Max Roach collaborated with Ellington on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Cash-Jungle\/dp\/B000SZDMES\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cash Jungle<\/a>. Like that album, Max and Mingus are paired on this one. I must say that as much as I admire Max I prefer Dannie Richmond when paired with Mingus because the way Mingus and Richmond would stretch and compress time, almost telepathically, intrigues me. It also influences my own playing when I am with the right musicians. With Max none of that stuff happens.\n\nThe entire album is magnum opus Mingus. Indeed, it was originally released as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Pre-Bird\/dp\/B000VRITJG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pre-Bird<\/a>, but in typical Mingus fashion it was repackaged.

It was just last week that I gave a four-star criticism to Marianne Faithfull's \"Why Did We Have to Part,\" and I've adored Julia Fordham for years.  Nontheless, there's something about Holland's voice that just grates on me.  Perchance it's the way she slurs her words sometimes so that it's hard to make out exactly what she's singing (did she go right to the recording studio after a root canal or something?).  Perchance it's that her heavy, breathy huskiness reminds me of the voice of a longtime cigarette smoker.  Perchance it's her whiny tone, or the way she seems to be arduous to swallow and sing at the same time, or just a feeling I have that she cares more about her affected delivery - I mean, her \"unique style\" - than what she's singing.\n\nWhatever it is, I don't like it.  It's not a ghastly song, but I'd definitely recommend listening to the sample before you download.","3211":"Been following Jeff Wood since last year.

Regrettably at the time when I acquired it, there wasn't a criticism listed  that the songs were not included on the soundtrack..so you are only buying instrumental music which the album wasn't crummy but really had nothing to it.","3213":"After three successful albums in the early 1980s and 7 R&B hit singles (one of them reaching #1, \"Lovelite\"), O'Bryan finally releases his fourth and final effort by the end of 1986.  Even at his peak in 1984, O'Bryan still struggled a bit to reach the same success as many other R&B hit makers and now as of 1986, the competition was a lot tougher with Anita Baker, Janet Jackson, Loose Ends, and Freddie Jackson dominating the R&B charts that year.  Hip-Hop\/rap music had already made a themselves a genre as nearly as equal to R&B and pop.  New Jack Swing music was slowly emerging by that point of which fused Hip-Hop and club oriented songs with R&B.\n\nSince 1984's Be My Lover success, O'Bryan spent nearly 3 years coming up with a good follow up that would adapt to the change of pop\/R&B music, but there was not much luck in those fields, nontheless he managed to gain one last hit, \"Tenderoni\" (#35, R&B) that became a club hit in early 1987.  Unlike his preceding albums, O'Bryan and Soul Train host, Don Cornelus didn't produce all of the songs.  O'Bryan recruited Jerry Knight (ex-Raydio member and ex-Ollie & Jerry fame) and Aaron Zigman to write and produce three of the 8 tracks that includes the slammin' \"Tenderoni\" and the sensitive and heartbreaking, \"You Have Got To Come To Me.\"  The latter didn't chart, but in my opinion it sounds finer than The Jets' 1986 hit, \"You Got It All\" (also produced by Knight and Zigman).  I think the 7 inch edited single version was finer because the album version just repeats the chorus (too redudant), plus the sound quality wasn't that great.  The best song on the album has to be \"What Goes Around\" which was also produced by Knight and Zigman and is a tuff dance track that should have been his second single, but Capitol records blindly chose the silly \"Driving Force\" as a single rather.  The only O'Bryan\/Cornelius produced song I enjoyed from this album would have to be \"Is This For Real\" of which is a sentimental and alluring new jack ballad that was far longed overlooked.  Now that song is Surrender's best ballad.  Before someone sends their loathe mail to me, I wasn't that fond of the ballad, \"Maria,\" but it wasn't his lowest song.  The title track was a dissapointment (instrumental was a rip off of Luther Vandross' \"Give Me A Reason\") while \"Dreamin' Of You\" was musically and vocally \"way too busy and unappealing.\"\n\n\"Tenderoni,\" \"What Goes Around,\" and \"Is This For Real\" were the only highlights of the lp with \"You Have Got To Come To Me\" rating 3.9 out of 5 (mid light). It was great that O'Bryan shared production duties with 2 top R&B producers, but I think many of the songs suffered from the repetitive chorus lines and instrumentals.  I think the album was sabatoged just like O'Bryan's career was shortly after the album's release.  It didn't help that there were many nasty rumors about O'Bryan circulating around the black music media that rode the passenger side with Capitol's crummy deals for the 25 year old singer.  His dissappointment with the music industry prompted him to go on a early retirement from the business. Other than appearing on Karyn White's first album in 1988 (see linear notes) and Paul Jackson Jr's 1988 album, I Came To Play, as a featured vocalist, O'Bryan was non existent until 2007's FLAC (later cd) release, F1rst.  Out of all his albums that should be reissued and remastered to itunes, Surrender wouldn't have been much worth it.  I think Surrender would've done finer with the wonder works of Reggie Calloway, LA Reid & Babyface, Nick Martinelli, and finer yet Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis because O'Bryan definitely had the vocals and energy for their type of music.","3214":"This is a criticism of both Noah Aronson's album \"Left Side of the Page\" and \"Am I Awake\" - I listen to them all in one playlist.\n\nNoah Aronson's music is great for helping out new converts to Reform Judaism, or the interfaith partner of a Reform Jew, or just really anyone who wants to know what a Reform Jewish religious service sounds like (so long as they use the prayerbook I mention below - which so far in my experience, most do).  All with some of the most alluring voices out there, and really gifted musical arrangements.  I presume that Noah Aronson composed the melodies in this album (not positive on that though).\n\nSeveral of the songs in Left Side of the Page and most of the songs in his other album, Am I Awake, follow along with one of the main Reform prayerbooks, Mishkan T'filah, which I personally find really alluring in itself. When I was arduous to find sources for Jewish service prayers and songs, almost all the prayers I could find were Orthodox or Consertative and didn't align to the services I was attending.  And many had (unhappy to be judgmental, but this is music and it's hard not to notice!) really strident voices, too \"old opera-y\" voices, and\/or harrowing accents in their Hebrew (eg \"Adonoy\" with an emphasis on the oy!).\n\nThis was a really nice change of pace - a guitar, a light male voice (tenor?), an accessible switch back and forth between Hebrew and English, a light accent (more Israeli than Ashkenazi), pretty duets with pretty-voiced cantors and musicians (including one really cool Nickel Creek sounding guitar arrangement) and nice melodies.  A really nice, respectful, enjoyable listen - and a great way to learn your way through a service.\n\nThat said, if you're arduous to learn how to chant prayers (some songs can be put to whatever music, while others have to be chanted according to the little squiggles in the Torah - unhappy don't know the name of them), you should Google \"Temple Habonim V'ahavta\" and learn for free from Cantor Jodi Blankstein, who has an unreal voice.","3215":"Who make you laugh so hard you will cry! Funny funny funny guy!","3216":"I loathe this song,I only got it to make lively of on my dj machine. This song stinks and has a old 1970s sound. Dont acquire to like, acquire to make lively of","3217":"Good music, what you'd expect from Hawkins & Webster . . .  Roy Eldridge sounds great too.\n\nBut look out! This version was mastered from a beatup vinyl record, not a master tape. Occasional surface noises are definitely noticeable on several tracks, including a scratch that makes an audible sound each time the turntable needle goes around and hits it again (on track 2).\n\nThis is a really weak move, and should have been mentioned in the album description.\n\nIt looks like the same material is available here on FLAC from another label as Ben Webster's YOUNG BEAN, and the previews there sound good as far as I can tell. You might want to spend a couple dollars more and get that recording rather than this one.","3218":"These tracks are all really low volume for some reason. I had to use a sound manipulation program (Audacity) to amplify them.\n\nAccording to a comprehensive online discography of Tommy Ladnier, there were six takes (not \"parts\") of \"Play That Thing\" --- a bluesy 1923 track with Jimmie Noone. This is the only FLAC source of takes 3 and 4 that I'm aware of. Each take is different enough that they are all interesting to me. You can search for mp3s and sort them all by length to separate out the different takes.\n\nIf you just want a decent collection of Tommy Ladnier, look elsewhere, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Tommy-Ladnier\/dp\/B001W9CVLO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tommy Ladnier<\/a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/1923-1939\/dp\/B00002791Y\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">1923-1939<\/a>.\n\nI supremely recommend the tracks \"Play That Thing\" (esp. what is called here Part 1), \"Peepin' Blues,\" \"Muddy Water Blues\" (Jelly Roll Morton), \"Barrel House Blues\" (Ma Rainey), and the magnum opus \"Really the Blues\" (Sidney Bechet), all of which contain Ladnier solos.\n\nIf you are seriously into Ladnier, there is a book and FLAC collection available on the same website as his discography.","3219":"UPDATE: 2017-03-28  Marvelio, the seller, sent me a new replacement record at no cost (kudos to Marvelio) nontheless the same problems still exist. This time the record appeared clean, nontheless the pops and click are almost nonstop. I've never had a dilemma like this for any new vinyl. And I have well used, poorly cared for, used vinyl that isn't as crummy as this. It's really depressing considering the music is quite good.\n\nBy it on CD, skip the vinyl.\n---\nOriginal Criticism:\n\nThe music is great nontheless the vinyl comes loaded with dust and dirt. How a brand new vinyl can have so much dust and dirt, I don't know. As a result there's lots of pops and clicks which ruins the music since there are a lot of quite passages in the songs. Also the inner sleeve is too small for the record and it's torn on two edges before I've even removed the record.","3220":"I adore this Concerto, but my disc broke. I acquired this as a replacement, regrettably the recording job is abhorrent. Lots of background static, the volume is too low in comparison with the norm, which is a shame since the orchestra sounds good. Fathom I'll have to look over a few before I purchase this Concerto again.","3221":"Just acquired this record to get a replacement sleeve for an existing have of this album. This is a very good Billy Vaughn recording. Even though there are others \"Summer Place\" is this oldest BV record I have in my collection. Dot's Ultra High Fidelity recording produced some of the very best stereo records I have ever heard and Biily Vaughn was certainly a very talented musician. The arrangements and studio mixing on these songs are first rate. Supremely recommend if can find a very good or finer used record. I transpired to pick my copy at Goodwill for only one dollar. It only needed some cleaning. After that it has spinning regularly on my turntable.","3222":"there is nothing to dislike about the old gospel, true singing voices.  The words and beat simply astonishing that me me just sing along, think about things and sometmes cry.  I wish I could give more stars","3223":"...#24, and kept the cd because Zacharias rarely ornaments in #24 and plays it as well as he can, at a B\/B- level I presume.  Nontheless, Leitner submits his third A+ #24 after four star versions with Kempff and Seemann, so that #24 deserves four stars overall.  I am guessing (only) that Leitner forbade CZ's customary intrusions. In #22 with Kord, though, he has free rein and,I presume, wrecks this great concerto (Mozart's third greatest after #s 24 and 25  I presume). The other movements are mutilated further. Both Brendel\/Marriner and Larrocha\/Segal and Davis employ ornamentation in their readings, and Brendel does very little of it in his fine version with Paul Angerer on Vox (see my criticism). Nontheless they are ascetic  compared to Zacharias. Of course\nthis is a subjective judgment, but even if the ornamentation here isn't bothersome, other pianists perform the concerto\nmore effectively, including Brendel\/Marriner\/Philips, de Larrocha\/Segal\/Decca, Brendel\/Angerer\/Vox, Larrocha\/Davis\/RCA, Haebler\/Davis\/Philips, Kempff\/Klee\/DG, Annie Fischer\/Sawallisch\/EMI, Edwin Fischer\/EMI and Peter\nFrankl\/Szell\/You Tube.","3224":"I agree with the other reviewers regarding this set as a whole. I'll just add comments I made on a preceding issue of ten of the symphonies on the Quadromania label in the middle of the last decade.\n\nErnest Bour conducts the SWF Radio Symphony Orchestra in ten Mozart symphonies, 25, 28, 29, 33, 35, 36, and 38-41. The recordings were done between 1964 and 1978, and released on Aurophon LPs. Membran licensed the tapes from Cascade, the owner, in 2004 for this set.\n\nI've listened to four of the symphonies, 25, 29, 35, and 39. The sound is dry and clear. Membran doesn't say when each work was recorded (another issue lists a recording date of January 1978 for 39 and 40), and they all clearly come from different sessions, but there's little difference between them. Bour's interpretations seem very straightforward in the best possible way. He doesn't dawdle in slow movements, he doesn't cover up wind and brass lines but he doesn't emphasize them, nothing sounds rushed.... it's hard to find something strikingly 'right' that Bour does, but that's because everything feels right as it is. I can hear the pitfalls he avoids, for example making the first movement of the Haffner ponderous - Bour's is 'crisp' like Szell, but warmer, less clipped. His 39 reminds me of Szell's as well, although gentler. (Szell was my \"imprint\" version, for what it's worth.) His 25 and 29 are good, and Bour avoids the temptation to be cloying in the latter symphony, but Marriner's early Phillips recordings get more out of these early works and are finer recorded and played. Then again, Marriner's Academy Of St. Martins in the Fields is hardly \"big band\" Mozart, so it's not the best comparison to Bour.\n\nContinuing through the set, 40 receives a top-notch performance. 41, which I'm listening to now, is pretty good too, with some wonderfully hushed playing in the second movement. I've listened to 28, 40, 41, and 29 again since my initial comments, and my enthusiasm for this set grows. The sound is slightly boxy, but not to the point its bothersome.\n\nCascade Media had a 40 CD Mozart box available a couple of years ago, which contained the Bour Symphonies from the Quadromania set and this X5 download, as well as the Magic Flute excerpts. I acquired that set for 20 bucks plus shipping, and if you can find it, get it, as it contains the Carmen Piazzini recordings of the piano concertos and piano sonatas, as well as a entire set of the violin concertos. This download is a good alternative if you can't get the Cascade set at a reasonable price.","3225":"This is a very good set of Mozart, and for the price is one of the best deals on Amazon's FLAC site. Germany's SWR (S&uuml;dwestrundfunk, or Southwestern Radio) Orchestra is a quality ensemble and the playing here is all very good to distinguished.\n\nIt's refreshing that this isn't a \"best of Mozart\" set -- except for some \"Magic Flute\" excerpts, these are all full-length works. And although a number of very familiar pieces are included, such as the Sinfonia Concertante or the Jupiter Symphony, it is not a set of Mozart you've already heard a hundred times.\n\nI did hear an occasion or two where I pondered some attacks were a little clumsy -- not intentionally fuzzy as in the Furtw&auml;ngler style, but just a bit muddled. But these were very few and far between and did not mar the set overall. While these are generally not performances that will beat the best out there, they are all supremely competent and enjoyable. Very worthwhile as great music well played, and worth a very warm recommendation at the bargain price (right now $4.99, although I paid a little more).","3226":"The song is great, but playback is significantly distorted, particularly the percussion track in the background.  Have struggled on a variety of devices and all show the same dilemma.  Perchance the FLAC was encoded poorly.","3227":"This song has all ways been one of my beloved from a musical that I totally loved. I don't see the video or disc here at Amazon but perchance someday.","3228":"WireRose - From The End EP (Independent)\nCurrently causing a stir in their home state of Georgia, where their unsigned status is the source of considerable bewilderment, WireRose continue unfazed with the job in hand - making music. Their latest, the four-track \"From The End EP\" consolidates their ultra-hip modern rock sound, building upon 2009's \"Waiting\" album and securing their status as a band to look out for.\n\nThere's a hint of `epic' in what they do, in their lyrics and playing, the resulting sound might best be described as progressive, though we're talking the Radiohead \/ Mansun school of prog rather than the `70s version, with plenty of post-punk urgency, especially in the guitars, to dispel any thoughts of excess. Their scale is reflected in the length of their songs; the four tracks here spread out over 22 minutes, though there's hardly a second wasted.\n\nOpening track \"Trip Away\" is simultaneously effortless and abrasive, like magnum opus psychedelia strained through a contemporary mesh. The title track dovetails `80s and `90s indie with right now, and again layers some wonderfully exciting guitar playing, the sort of thing that takes you back to the first time we heard Robert Smith or The Edge. \"Monster\" may lack a little of the intensity of other tracks but more than compensates with a chunky, choppy rhythm and the most insistent of choruses. If they're going to get on the radio, that's the one.","3229":"Very talented pianist, and for that the two stars were awarded.  The title is very misleading, nontheless.  This is a classical album with jazz as played by a classical pianist.  Technique is marvelous, but jazz is absent.  If you adore listening to classical piano and do not already have the selections on this album, you will enjoy it.  If you were hoping for a fresh new Jazz holiday CD, you will be greatly disconcerted.","3230":"I regret this purchase and DO NOT RECOMMEND. After buying This I found out there is an app for way less $ that is 100x finer. This app tricked us into a few tourist traps, it had us turning around multiple times arduous to find an obscure place that wasn't as great as other places. It is outdated and full of advertisements for places along the way. This cd made our trip a lot less astonishing than it could have been, and is one of my only regrets about my trip to Maui\u20ac","3231":"I was really excited to get a few pregnancy meditation cd's.  I wish I had realized how short this one was before I spent $8.99 to acquire the FLAC's!  It is fine for a short meditation but if you are looking for something that lasts longer, skip this one! If you have any experience with guided meditation, I do not recommend this cd, it just doesn't have enough substance.","3232":"I listened to this track about 6 times and it was 6 times too many. This nobody arduous to get paid by dissin Hova! The hook is weak as is his attempt to steal the beat. This guy need to be put 6 feet under! Jay-Z is tha MAN! I haven't seen anyone besides Dr. Dre and Jay-Z be this influential in the game. Now you can put Eminem and 50 Cent in that category, but this was a entire misuse of time to listen to. He only did it so he can try to sell records. He must not reallize that Hova has millions of fans worldwide that won't acquire his junk. Jada and 50 had a lively beef going with two talented spitters. This guy sux!","3233":"I didn't realize it was a \"live\" version, otherwise I wouldn't have acquired it. I previewed it under the individual song listing and it appeared fine. The full version is ghastly. I would like to take replace this with the real version, but without being able to preview the full song, I won't take any chances.","3234":"The dance floor loved it.  Nontheless, from a quality of audio standpoint, it lacks tremendously.  Whatever transpired to non-compressed files?  Nothing against the orchestra that recorded this but I am certain they do not hear all of their playing the way they pondered it would be heard.","3235":"Shelbey has a fine voice. That is a alluring rendition on John Ylvisaker's \"I Was There To Hear Your Borning Cry.\"  We have sung this hymn at our Lutheran Church for many years at baptisms, weddings, and funerals. Every time I hear it, it deliver tears to my eyes. I disagree that it is too fast. She used the early version of the song. \"When you find someone...\"  was replaced by \"IF you find someone\". I will be listening to other cuts on her albums to download.","3236":"I want to start by making one thing clear: Mickey Thomas is one of my all time favourite male rock vocalists and I adore his work with Starship.\n\nSo, it's with a heavy heart I write this criticism. This is simly put a ghastly album. His voice sounds great, but I don't want to hear an album with covers. The lowest song without a doubt is the Hip Hop mix version of \"Life is a Highway\", closely followed by \"Cash Talks\". No, no and NO. \"Hollywood Nights\" is the only song i find FINE.\n\nI would adore to see someone provide him with new melodic rock songs and make an album that makes his great voice justice.

Not since a good decade ago when I was in high school has a band earned such a coveted and nearly unmoved spot in my CD player!","3238":"First.  I don't write many musical criticisms.  I prefer to spend my time either playing or listening.  Second.  A disclaimer: Yes I am A BW fan; nontheless, I have not been shy about expressing my honest opinion about his various projects.  That said, I adore these tracks.  I have always wondered what BW would sound like playing straight-ahead Jazz.  I can still hear elements of the \"Parliament days\" sound.  Those weird \"irks and quirks\" that are BW signatures.  As a matter of fact, I was expecting an all acoustic CD, but was surprised to hear those vintage electronic keyboard sounds.  My beloved are his versions of Take 5, and Watermelon Man. Both stick fairly close to the original melodies, but they are definitely BWs interpretation of the tunes.  I boil things down simply:  Would Herbie Hancock like BW's version of Watermelon Man?  I bet so.  Would Dave Brubeck like \"Take 5?\"  I bet.  Antonio Carlos Jobim would appreciate \"Agua de Beber\" ... and so on.  BW's whimsical approach to music reminds me of another one of my heroes: Thelonious Monk.  Both men seem to just hear what they hear, and play what they play.  So I'm thrilled BW is taking a minute to play Jazz.\n\nRespectfully Submitted;\n\nWTG","3239":"FINE, it's official: I'm old. I MUST be old; all these people who were the firebrands of my youth are making these discs\/records\/recordings - whatever you call them nowadays - where they show that they are \"mature\" in some sort of way. What way is demonstrated on this one? Well, none really - if you judge it by the way it sounds. But Jazz, as a signifier, represents something like \"a more advanced, more reflexive musicianship\". I call BS - really! This is a Jazz record the way hearing the theme of Blowin' In The Wind over Muzak in a supermarket is Rock. The only thing that remains from the brilliance that Mr. Worrell demonstrated in the past is an enormous sensitivity to the vast tonal and emotional palette that \"keyboards\" are capable of - he really changed that game, especially in terms of how Pop producers used those instruments. This is audible here, for example, on You're My Thrill where both subtle and not - so - subtle shifts of vibrato function somewhat as they do in the tenor sax playing of a Ben Webster. There are some little pleasures like this to be found here. But they are far and few between. Most of the time, there is a plodding repetition of themes, toneless wanking substituting for improvisation...all of this accompanied by a crack team of top level Downtown New York Freelancers who were, I'm sure, constantly high - fiving each other in the studio between takes, telling each other how \"killing these tracks are\". Well, you can sleep the sleep of the just, henchmen; you did the best that you could do, given the dire circumstances. And, publicist, too, you did your job - NPR profile about how aging Funkmeister goes back to his Jazz roots, etc.,etc., ad nauseum, blah, blah, blah...It's not your fault either. Is it Bernie's fault? I don't want to denigrate the man who added so much genius to Flashlight, Funkentelechy, Chocolate City and so many other Funk Masterpieces. I'd rather just call it - bitter. Weak and bitter.","3240":"These Devaraja - Khmer empire songs do not have any one thing to do with Khmer music at all.

His voice is still alluring and his diction - in three languages - is distinguished, but he would have done finer to sing a cappella, the mix was so crummy.  And then - to add insult to injury - the DVD of Toi et Moi !!!  What on earth induced him to introduce chains, whips and a woman screaming in .... pleasure? Anguish? Who knows?  Who cares?  Whatever it was, it was ludicrous, cliches stacked on top of cliches in a package that would have been offensive if it wasn't so laughable.  I think I'm still a fan of Hvorostovsky - singing opera and Russian folk songs - but this album does nothing to enhance his reputation and I won't be playing it again.  In fact, I'd give it away if there's anyone out there who wants to go to the trouble of letting me know where I can send it to.","3247":"Ghastly acquire.  Rhema doesn't sing at all on the cd.

I am a new singer and I was hoping this would help me strengthen my voice while I drive.\n\nThe music is very professional, on an electric keyboard. The guy sings the combination once through at the beginning of each exercise. But each exercise is complicated, like \"Ha-he-hee-hee-la-la-loo-loo-e-i-e-i-oh\" (every syllable a different note). Rather of playing the melody that I need to sing along with, he plays background chords and I am struggling to remember the melody that I am supposed to be singing. Then he keeps interjecting \"helpful\" things during the exercise like \"Remember to relax your jaw\", \"Be sure to breathe properly\". Then I am even more lost because I am still struggling with the melody that I am supposed to be singing and he is talking over the chords and I don't know where I am. Then, during the SAME exercise, he will change the sound I am supposed to be singing, \"Now sing it with \"Yaw-yaw-yaw, rather of Yee-yee-yee\" (or whatever). More frustration and demands while he is pounding out chords and I am lost and I have no belief what the melody is. Not lively. Not helpful. Too confusing. After the third exercise, I just gave up.\n\nI would have rather simpler melodies, stick with the same sounds per exercises, and play the melody rather of chords so I know where I am supposed to be, and stop interrupting.","3250":"\"Wired Life\" marked a strong move into a much more hard edged Techno sound for Meisa Kuroki, who has been previously involved in much more RnB styled music. \"Wired Life\" is at 128 Beats Per Minute and it would make a good late night club groove - the verses of the song have an elegantly brooding mood to it contrasted with a forceful but poised chorus. If you like the music of Goldfrapp, Little Boots, La Roux or perchance Miss Kittin, then you will like this song from Meisa Kuroki. If you're well versed in Japanese music, this song is probably closer to the music of Perfume, Kotoko or Saori@destiny.\nMeisa Kuroki sings with a strong clear adult pop-soprano voice with no vocal affectations. Unlike some of her peers, she doesn't go in for the use of vocoders or other electronic vocal treatments of her voice.\n\nThere are four versions of \"Wired Life\" offered here - the standard song, which clocks in at just over four and a half minutes. There's an instrumental version, which shows just how good the electronic music is in this song. A mix with dialogue from the anime and a short anime version.\n\nA further version of \"Wired Life\" appears on Meisa Kuroki's more recent single, \"Woman's Worth\".\n\nHopefully, a new album by Meisa Kuroki is in the works. I think that 2012 will be a big year for Ms Kuroki, and Nami Tamaki, too, whose new single \"Lady Mind\" could be the \"sister\" single of \"Wired Life\".\n\n2012 - I predict that Meisa Kuroki and Nami Tamaki will be doing some great things in the realms of Japanese electronic\/techno-dance music.","3251":"It's a alluring song. The one star is for Amazon's stupid process of requiring a download app to be installed to access an Flac that has no DRM. The user experience is junk and Amazon should know finer. You guys run AWS. Figure out a way to provide a download link to an Flac without making me go through an app or hidden instructions or similar junk.","3252":"How do you take a magnum opus and supremely recognizable voice and totally wreck her debut CD?  This is the blandest, most unimaginative music ever.  Someone made a gargantuan blunder when they asked her to record this mess.  She deserved much finer.","3253":"Saw Harlend a couple years ago in concert 3 times and boy do they rock! I acquired their first CD, an EP at one of the shows and it was great; I eagerly anticipated a full length album which this is. Some of the guys are from another local band I also saw numerous times and disbanded for whatever reason and then formed Harlend. They certainly know what they're doing.\n\nFrom the bands Website: Keep You not only offers the desired catchy melodies and strong hooks you can find in other popular music, but more importantly it presents a challenge to its listeners. It is a call to action, a call to adore, and cry for revival. With massive guitars, pounding drums, pondered-provoking lyrics, and gut-wrenching vocals, Harlend is a welcome addition to any iTunes playlist.\n\nPersonally I feel the album doesn't break any new ground but treads the same Christian rock ground as many of their contemporaries with passion, gusto, and conviction. I supremely recommend Keep You.","3254":"This folk-pop album is a pleasure to listen to. The songs have a genuine, heartfelt feeling, and the arrangements are clean and true, and, well, real. The upbeat \"And I'm Happy\" has an almost anthemic quality, while the \"Grandfather Song\" stirs up recollections of loved ones lost or never found. After listening to the gentle, comforting second track, it's accessible to presume that Everything Will, indeed, Be Just Fine. Long distance adore is the topic of the pretty ballad \"Back to Minnesota\" and the foot tapping, rock-style \"Mile 77.\" The youthful final track, \"Get it Right,\" reminds us of the ups and downs of new adore. All in all, a terrific debut that makes me eager to hear what comes next from this talented newcomer.","3255":"What the heck has transpired to Falling Up? Their last album blew, and this album is just as crappy. Jesse Ribordy (lead singer) has to know that this new, slower, sadder sound is just absolutely depressing to hear when compared to Falling Up's other albums. It's not rocking AT ALL! I was willing to forgive the lameness of Fangs, and when I had read the other criticisms of this album, I was filled with hope that perchance Falling Up had returned to the sound that had made me such a fan. I was so optimistic that I 1-clicked acquired this album without even hearing a snippet! And now, after listening to the lameness that is Your Sparkling Death Cometh, all I can say is \"can I get my cash back?\"","3256":"You have got to be kidding me. Come on, what is the real price? This is the only offering of this CD, everything else is FLAC download which I do NOT want.... But i ainna gonna spend THAt much for this CD no matter how good Adrian's music might be!","3257":"I'm always on the lookout for good guitar driven modern rock with clean vocals. It seems to be getting harder and harder to find these days, with so many bands turning to synthesizers, retro lo-fi garage band sounds, or emo screamy vocals. Sleeper Agent is good music though. Celebrasion has kind of a wild crazy, in-your-face party vibe going on, and it's super catchy and lively. Every song packs punch, with snappy beats and belting guitar rhythms.\n\nI can't really think of any bands I can compare Sleeper Agent to. They have a bit of a modern indie sound with perchance a bit of punk, but it has a breezy, carefree quality to it that makes you move. The vocals remind me somewhat of Grouplove or Modest Mouse, which I think is part of what gives them that \"indie\" sound. But the music... Make no mistake, what you get here is straight up, no holds barred rock, and it's First-rate.","3258":"I loooooooove this song.\nAdore adore adore adore adore adore adore adore adore adore adore adore adore adore adore it.  :D","3259":"I had to give this a rating and there isn't one low enough for what I think of it.

I loathe it!!!","3260":"I acquired this knowing that it wouldn't be great, but I was going to see the musical and I like to have the music in my head before I see any musical. Nontheless, from the second the overture stated during the actual show, I realized that this was NOT the soundtrack, not even close. If you are the same as me, DO NOT acquire this album, as it is not the musical soundtrack (even though the cover sort of matches the posters.)\n\nIt's like a bunch of people -- having no belief there was an ACTUAL Flashdance musical -- recorded a bunch of songs that they had lying around that pondered might be in a musical. \"What a Feeling\" is there of course, as is \"Maniac\" (both of which are also in the musical). \"Gloria\" is not.  Then, they add a bunch of random \"80's\" songs, none of which have any one thing to do with the story. \"Fame\" -- fine, I fathom. \"The Rose\"... Hm... \"Maria\" from West Side Story... WTF?!? By the time that you hear \"Let The Sunshine In\" from Hair you realize that the producers of the album were tripping too hard during the 70's to notice the transition to the 80's.\n\nTotal misuse of cash-- this is an album of music that is kinda sorta not really inspired by the BELIEF of a Flashdance musical. But not good inspiration -- the singing is third rate and the song selection is lousy. DO NOT ACQUIRE unless you really like these songs-- but listen to the previews first!\n\nBTW -- There is an actual Flashdance Musical, and it is actually really good, and this album is really an insult to it. When THAT album comes out, I will totally acquire it.","3261":"This CD entitled \"Music Therapy For Deep Sleep - Relaxing Nature Sounds and Music\" is produced by Super Audio PVT LTD in Chennai, India and performed by Joseph Vijay.  It is close to an hour long and is structured into six tracks of which four are about 10 minutes long and a single track (Track 3) is only about three and a half minutes long.\n\nFine, let me say upfront, this is only my opinion.  There are fans of every type of music...music I don't like, others will, and vice versa.  I don't like this CD.  I found it very uneven and, toward the end, impossible to relax to while listening.  The first track, Forest, is pretty good with a single piano composition.  There are bird sounds in the background but they are so soft that they fade away as the piano is playing.  The second track, Surf, is also pretty good.  The composition is played with a piano (or synthesizer?) with some electronic enhancement like reverb.  The surf is loud enough to fit well with the piano lead.  But by the third track, Storm, the CD begins to go off the rails.  The lead is a high pitched piano accompanied by strings.  The storm is essentially white noise in the background with an occasional wind gust that reminds my of a windy dry desert.  The fourth track, Thunder, is jarringly high pitched with strings, winds, and some piano interspersed with thunder.  The fifth track, Waterfall, deliver back the piano\/synthesizer? with reverb.  The waterfall sound is almost indistinguishable from white noise.  The score is played so slowly that the composition is just occasional high pitched random notes rather than a musical score.  The final track, jungle, deliver back bird sounds and a high pitched piano with reverb.  The last four tracks are so jarring that they kept me awake rather than relaxed me.  This is not a CD for sleeping.  It tries for a drifting New Age vibe but absolutely misses the mark.  The integration of nature and music is meager and the track scores are more bothersome than relaxing.  You won't be falling asleep listening to this.","3262":"PLEASE DO NOT ACQUIRE THIS!!!

It's tought to pick songs from this album though because it's very cohesive and doesn't have any throw away tracks. That said, Phoenix Alive and Adore Get Out Of My Way are probably my beloved.

But this one doesn't even begin to compare. The hypnotherapists voice seems cool and disinterested. Some of the music was okay but there were moments where the background music reminded me of the music they play in movies right before or during the big action scenes--I immediately tensed up.\n\nI didn't relax even once during the entire album and relaxation is the key component that makes any hypnosis work. I don't see how the suggestions for determination, motivation, willpower and fighting procrastination will work when I can't even relax when I'm hearing them. With the \"Fast Technique for Stress Relief\" I fell into a deeply relaxed state almost from the very beginning and felt relaxed through all the suggestions.\n\nThere are finer hypnosis albums out there.","3273":"Biggs' 1964 recording of the E-flat Prelude and Fugue which is presented here poses many problems.  His use of overdotting in the \"homophonic\" sections of the prelude and taking those recurring sections in a different tempo from the more overtly \"contrapuntal\" sections is both misleading and a misconception.  In the forte and piano alternating motifs near the beginning of the prelude, Biggs renders the three sixteenth notes leading into it as an eighth and two sixteenths, adopting an absurd \"seufzer\"-type two-note phrasing in his inimitable \"touch and go\" style of mostly sempre staccato playing, as Melville Smith long ago characterized it.\n\nThe fugue---really three fugues, each built upon the other and the last two being double fugues (the second is for the hands only)---suffers from Biggs' obliviousness to phrasing: the main subject, coincidentally resembling William Croft's hymn tune \"St. Anne\" (it is doubtful if Bach knew this tune, which made its initial appearance some thirty-one years before this fugue was written), is broken up at (if memory serves) an upward leap of a fourth between B-flat and E-flat.  I suppose the best thing that can be said about this playing is that it's accurate.  Biggs was fifty-eight years old at the time he made this recording, and the master tape was probably engineered by EPB himself (as were most of his recordings in what is now Adolphus Busch Hall). He was in the throes of rheumatoid arthritis, and often in the flesh was not capable of delivering the kind of performance you hear on this record.  The style of the first fugue (for four voices) always struck me as reminiscent of that of old choral motets, and there are many opportunities for approximating a choral sound on the organ in this piece----mostly a clean legato, opportunities for \"stretching\" (i.e., tempo rubato) and so on.  You will not hear any of this from Mr. Biggs.\n\nThe second fugue (manuals only, and challenging for even a seasoned player---if you want the piece to come across with the sense of voice-leading it deserves)---is chopped up and musical lines can only be extrapolated.  The last fugue is just notes.\n\nI should point out that Mr. Biggs made another recording of BWV 552 (in stereo) a few years earlier, on the much larger Schnitger organ at Zwolle, The Netherlands, restored by Flentrop.  It is still wanting, but he took the prelude at a single tempo in that version and (as I remember---I have not heard that record in over forty years) took an expansive approach to the work.  I have not heard Mr. Biggs' earlier recordings of this prelude and fugue (mono era)---but those would be interesting comparisons.\n\nIn his own liner notes, Biggs credits the coupling of the Prelude and the Fugue (which respectively open and close the third part of JSB's \"Clavieruebung\", often called the \"Lutheran Organ Mass\") to Felix Mendelssohn.  Perchance.  It was Friedrich Griepenkerl, the first editor of the Peters edition of J.S. Bach's entire organ works, who presented them that way in the third volume of that edition, and made the coupling stick.\n\nE. Power Biggs, for all his faults, was a unique figure in the history of organ performance.  He had guts, drive and imagination, and essentially created his own position.  He came to New York jobless and conspicuously lacking in funds, initially hoping to land a church position.  He contacted T. Tertius Noble, then music director at St. Thomas' Church in NYC, who found him an Episcopal job in Newport, R.I.  Biggs was eventually fired from that job --- it was assumed that, since he was an Englishman, he knew something about training boy choristers (he didn't) and became disillusioned with the church.  Barbara Owen tells that story in her book \"E. Power Biggs, Concert Organist\".  Biggs took another church job in Cambridge, Mass., which remained his permanent home until he died.  He held that church job until the late 1950s, but rarely played services.  He started an ambitious series of recitals, and persuaded the curator of the Bush-Reisinger Museum at Harvard to install an experimental \"neoclassical\" organ built by Aeolian-Skinner in what was then called the Romanesque Hall. He initiated a series of live radio broadcasts from that hall.  Twenty-one years later, this instrument was replaced by the Flentrop heard in the recording under discussion here.  Sadly, the year 1958---which saw the installation of the famous Flentrop, a marvel of an expanded chamber organ---also saw the cancellation of the radio broadcasts and the onset of Biggs' arthritis, which he fought, as best he knew how, for the rest of his life.","3274":"Oh No.  i pondered I was buying the whole 86 Chapters.

I have owned another recording by Mal Waldron, the 1986 Village Vanguard group with the great Woody Shaw and Charlie Rouse.  Although many consider this Village Vanguard session to be a magnum opus, I found it mundane.  So I was skeptical of this recording. Now, I treasure it.\nIt was recorded in Japan in 1983.\nMal has an unusual piano style, quite unique.  I won't attempt to describe it, but suffice it to say it has elements of Monk, and many other pianists.  Mal's music can be brooding.  The final slice on this CD \"Waltz For My Mother\" falls under the emotion of brooding, and is a lovely performance.\nAnd drummer Ed Blackwell also has an unusual style.  He has taken what I call an old fashioned New Orleans drumming style and turned it to a style suitable to play in the legendary early recordings of Ornette Coleman, Dewey Redman and Don Cherry.  Go figure!  If you can explain how a Baby Dodds New Orleans style of drumming lends itself to the avant-garde, let me know.  At any rate, it works.  Ed's bouncing, elegant rhythm fits in perfectly with Mal's deliberate, searching note choices.\nI don't mean to neglect bassist Reggie Johnson.  He contributes fine accompianment, as well as good plucked and bowed solos.\nThis CD is a swinging, but controlled interpretation of jazz standards such as \"Bag's Groove,\" \"Billie's Bounce,\" and \"Round Midnight.\"  There is great beauty contained herein.  These are mature artists playing at their best.","3284":"Just three songs?  The world deserves more of The Advice.

Bring the album!","3285":"Wagner was the George Lucas of his day, cribbing bits and pieces of authentic legends into a confused mish-mash of, in his case, fantasy opera, as Lucas later did in space opera.  Wagner was the apotheosis of the Central European late-Romantic tradition's devolution into pure bombastic excess.  As music could not develop further in this direction, in the 20th Century composers turned their backs on Wagner's overblown emptiness, freeing themselves to explore serialism, atonality, minimalism, ambient sound, and other previously unthinkable techniques.\n\nThe \"Ring\" cycle has since become a staple of low comedy, with the large, screaming blonde women in horned helmets, and the expression \"it ain't over until the fat lady sings\" (what impatient spectators were told while sitting through interminable \"Ring\" performances).  In \"What is Art,\" Tolstoy gives an outstanding criticism of an early \"Ring\" production that may be the funniest piece he ever wrote.  His insight is remarkable - it's accessible to make lively of Wagner today, but at the time Tolstoy saw it, the \"Ring\" was considered to be the highest art imaginable.  My belief of the ideal \"Ring\" would have all of the characters dressed as clowns, with Larry David as Seigfried, Rosie O'Donnell as Brnnhilde (lip-syching to vocals by Yoko Ono), and Justin Bieber as Alberich.  There should be plenty of pie throwing, banana peels, and eye poking  la The Three Stooges.  With the special effects available today, it should also be possible to show someone skiing through a chain-link fence and turning into a pile of ice cubes on the other side.\n\nSuffering through the marathon of an entire \"Ring\" performance can be of value only to specialists in the history of music or obsessed completists.  Castorf's recent production at Bayreuth in honor of Wagner's 200th birthday was roundly booed by the audience.","3286":"Oh my....how to rate this\n\nFirst, some perspective:  I adore Gilda.

It was slice directly from the movie and is NOT a stand alone entire title. As such, it is very disapointing.\n\nHonestly, I could have just recorded it from the movie myself, and I would have done a finer job clipping and cleaning it up.\n\nI suspect (though Im not going to bother checking) that the movie and songs are public domain, and that whoever recorded the song, edited it and converted to FLAC saw a way to make a fast buck\n\nSo 5 stars for the song, -3 stars for a direct movie rip (and rip off)\n\nRecomendation: Skip it. You may as well rip it from the movie yourself","3287":"Greenrose Faire - Neverending Journey (Independent)\nGreenrose Faire is a six-piece medieval folk-rock band from Finland. I imagine live they're an absolute blast, and go down a storm at medieval fairs, and suchlike, but \"Neverending Journey\", their debut long-player, is worthy of attention in its own right. Their jaunty playing, Tomi Hyttinen's songs and Salla Rimmi's magnum opus folk vocals come together to form something that falls between Steeleye Span's finer moments and the hugely enjoyable Circulus. The fact that their record sleeve deliver to mind the minstrels in Ingmar Bergman's \"The Seventh Seal\" just adds to the kudos.\n\nUnusually for this sort of project, they neither pander to metal fans or proggers. Rather they stick to their own vision of four hundred year old song and dance music, with the latter desire to get an audience moving, an important factor. It's rare that I come across so many instruments that I don't know. These include a dadgad guitar, mandocello, Irish bouzouki and ifteli. If their desire was to worry my spellchecker, they've succeeded on several counts.\n\nThere are a number of tracks on \"Neverending Journey\" that I find myself returning to with some frequency. The opening call to arms of \"Dance 'Til Morning Light\" seems to function in the same way as Fairport's \"Come All Ye\" on \"Liege And Lief\". \"Beggars And Thieves\" has all the energy of The Levellers at their most strident (I am, of course referring to the crusty folk-rock band rather than the 17th century English radicals), and not forgetting \"Witchdance\", another floorshaker, and not unlike All About Eve - but considerably more lively.","3288":"Acquired entire series, not helpful or good meditations.  Wasted cash.","3289":"I've read several biographies of Rita Hayworth that make a point of the fact that she was never allowed to sing her own songs. Even Robert Osborne on TCM made that point in his intro to one of her movies. The only information I can find on who might have dubbed in the actual singing is from her obituary published in the New York Times, which credited Anita Ellis for the singing in four of her movies (but only listed \"Pal Joey\" and \"The Adores of Carmen\"). It's a bit of a failure. I adore Rita's singing in the movies and the songs in this collection, but how can they pawn this off as a Rita Hayworth collection if it's not her doing the singing?\n\nNontheless, I acquired several of the songs in this collection anyway because I enjoyed Rita's performance in the associated movie. When I listen to them, I see Rita in the relevant scene from the movie.\n\nSo the bottom line is: go ahead and enjoy the songs but remember that it is not Rita Hayworth doing the actual singing.","3290":"Just scored this CD and its awe-inspiring.\\m\/","3291":"These guys are really great.

If you presume that, go to a neurosurgeon and have your brain checked because i think what you have in there is actually a piece of shite rather of brains!","3295":"Let me just politely say that if you went to the Renn Faire or Pennsic and were blown away, and something deep within your soul craves more Tartanic like mine did, this is not the CD you want. Trust me. You want \"Uncivilized\". And you want to open all your car windows and blast it, preferably driving slowly up and down your street in a quiet residential neighborhood. I'm sure there are some people somewhere who really like \"UnFaire\", perchance some European disco types or something. Not that there's any one thing wrong with that, it's just not my cup of mead. I know, I know, this is art, and artists need to be free to go where their artistic expression takes them, and who am I to judge. But really guys? I fathom I should have been tipped off by the name, but then again I probably am as stupid as I look. Nine dollars worth of stupid. Oh well, \"Uncivilized\" was worth at least double what I paid for it so I fathom I came out even.","3296":"I adore these songs. I have varying levels of insomnia (depending on the day and my anxiety level) and struggle to get to sleep as well as stay asleep, to make things worse, medication only seems to work for me for about a week before my body grows accustomed to it and the medication stops working. My therapist introduced me to meditation and, after I commented on how well it worked during our sessions, suggested that I try it before bed to help clear my mind. These work great for this. I especially like the ones with the birds and\/or wind sounds, it's so peaceful and not obnoxious like some of the others I've heard with excess sounds. They help me visualize that I'm in a field or something in the middle of nowhere. One thing to keep in mind; this is a compilation and I found that I already have some of the songs on the full album, so I would suggest going through the samples and checking that you don't already have some of the songs.","3297":"This musical title is any one thing but Magnum opus or Egyptian.  It's downright wierd.  I've listened to a lot of classical Arabic music, particularly  Egyptian music, both modern and golden-era.  I'm also familiar with a lot of fusion music.  This CD is different from all of those.  There is singing in English, with lyrics that are frankly a little dumb and almost Orientalist-sounding.  I just can't imagine myself ever using this music for performing and some of it makes me cringe.\n\nI can't presume this CD was made by the same fabulous musician (Dr. Samy Farag) who produced&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Midnight-Magic-Belly-Dance-Music\/dp\/B000065EON\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Midnight Magic - Belly Dance Music<\/a>","3298":"When I acquired this I didn't realize that the songs weren't sung by the original artists. Perchance it says that somewhere, but it wasn't clearly communicated. They are covers of famous country songs and not very good ones at that. There is no point in buying this CD unless perchance you know someone who sang on it.","3299":"These guys sing great, the music sounds great, they may not be the original artists but they do one hell of a job sounding like 'em.","3300":"I adore this piece of music, but I don't adore this performance of it. You don't hear the snare drum clearly, and that seems especially important at the beginning of the piece. It's alluring, but it's not the performance I pondered I was buying. It's a shame that the preview of the song can't be a little longer for such a long piece.","3301":"I acquired this FLAC to compare it to the magnum opus Western Swing song&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Eskimo-Nell\/dp\/B006VRG5RI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Eskimo Nell<\/a>.

Avoid!","3302":"this song stinks. lowest remix ever. don't misuse your cash.go acquire a pie from mcdonalds rather or coke. its not worth a dollar.i turn it on to get my little brothers out of my room","3303":"This cover has little to no redeeming qualities. I do not like the original Party Rock Anthem, so I pondered I would give the cover a try. Do not make the same mistake I did. You will be regretting the loss of a dollar that you could have spent on something more useful. Or given to a homeless man. Or drawn on. Or fed to a goat. Literally any other use of a dollar would be finer than wasting it on this cover.","3304":"Nothing special about the song, itself. It is energetic, I'll say that much. The lyrics make no sense, though. I mean \"Whiskey seems to be my holy water...\"? Does that mean he has an aversion to whiskey? (Whoever heard of a musician hating whiskey?) Or is is he saying he adores whiskey (Which makes sense with the rest of the song), and he's freakin' clueless how vampires work?\nThe rest of the song doesn't get finer, lyrically or musically.\nHating it...","3305":"Let me 1st just say this....The fact that these guys aren't signed to a major label or at the least touring the world is flat out crime.\n\nThe Bastard Suns are one of those bands that putting any label on them is just not going to do them justice.  To describe there sound I'd say at their heart it's punk.  Heavily influenced by Rancid, Crummy Religion, Sublime, House of Pain, & some Rockabilly Soul.  The band is amazingly tight, the drummer is just unreal, & the singers voice.....what can I say.....it's phenomenal!  There's no strain to it or falsetto, it's like Jameson Whiskey, smooth & harsh at the same time.\n\nTheir originals are great, lively, pub songs, and the covers they choose suit them perfectly.  And in case you haven't listened to other EP's the song selections suit the Season they were written for perfectly! These EP's are an incredibly original way to put out their music.  They allow their fans to get to know each song well enough to sing along to them & right when you start jonesing for more...POW!  A new one was released.\n\nAcquire all 4 of these EP's you won't regret it!","3306":"Fine first of all I ordered my copy from Amazon Warehouse Deals. It was listed as Used- Like New.  I have ordered many many things with Amazon, but never have I received such a mis labelled mess as this.  First off the original packaging of the CD's was horribly damaged.  It was dented, scuffed, torn, bent and scratched.  Tape was added to hold the package together which had been advertised as Factory Sealed and there was a sticker on it which said Factory Inspected, which was covering a large amount of the damage.  The CD's appeared to be fine though and I needed them for a Project at the school I work at so I kept them.  When I played them I soon realized that the play lists were not even close to the ones in the listing.... The following is the correct  listing taken from the box.... additionally the cd's had no labeling on them at all so when  I had to transfer them to a holder I needed to  type up a list ... The factory packaging was large and unwieldy and the CDs were not very safely contained in their slips. They were very difficult to remove and even if the original package had been pristine I probably would not have kept them in it. The extra tape peeled off part of the label of one of my cds.  What I listened to appeared fine, but is nothing special.  There was no particular flow of the music and I am glad I acquired another CD which has a much finer mix of tunes from the war years\n\n1.

Everything about it looks like it but the songs are not the original cuts!","3311":"From the HOINH MySpace page (no, I didn't write this!)\n\nWhat a mixed bag after a few listens to this album. HOINH is a large group, the new wave had some really important records in the past months and weeks. Not enough that these monstrous hits. Let's get in most songs, which you surely know.\nIt is the definition of the new wave of track and eighties-style, \"Hohohoinhho\". A scenario for a man makes her a star and is on her own. And she leaves him? The participation of the dialogue really captures you and the savvy mix of techno keyboards and catchy is legendary. \"This Is A Gun\" is a fairly optimistic number keypad with a touch of ska feeling, but without the horns. The things this group have keyboards, I'll tell ya. \"I Have A Real Feeling\" is a sensitive adore song, and has continued in the direction of the new wave of brilliance, but this time R & B master HOINH a rift in the group. The production is a simple mixture of drum machines and light touch of ivory. A magnum opus era of big hair and their second smash ( \"Space And Time Continuhoinh\" is their first). Their next hit here known to the obscure nature, but if you had an eye on MTV and VH1 for about a month or so in 2007, you have to hear this clubby record with a retro feel in ads for shows reality. \"Cyerscheisse\" is very much like \"N For Nerd,\" but the sound is of a Europe that effort updated dance, which is very plausible, but I do not know, it was could be a gargantuan chart hit here.\n\nThey need to know and how these four songs, as I was, and am still, but looked at the rest of the series, and asked: \"Total Hoinh\". Well, the truth is revealed that in this sentence HOINH is really not that the industry is a band, but one of its New-Wave Experiment, worked a few times. The rest of the songs are mostly dark-sounding accounts of adore. \"A Fluid In The Light\" trip to Motown \"Karma Chameleon\" (even if this does not come, first served). No one asked for, have they? Trippy request comes as a creepy in \"Banned Electro\" and \"ShakeASpear 4 Shakspeare.\" These early efforts together with \"Das Falche Gebot\" are just ghastly and dated. \"Banned Electro\" is so much talk here that you think it was a great political song, but it is so dry and pop, that it feels stale rocky.\n\nThe not big hits are not so crummy, but a required taste, you do not expect here. The lively pop hits here, but are very important and very danceable. For the hits, you might want to be this sentence, but the aging of the eighties synth arrangements pull the album. Also, I know it's strange that I want, that imports, but I found it on a trip and had only musically something different from the United Kingdom. Perchance next time I should for something modern.","3312":"This album from top to bottom is a diverse mix of smooth melodies that provide a unique musical perspective about living in the faith. I think that the sequencing of the songs was on-point and allowed the listener to go through the ebb and flow of the walk that most Christians have. Christon's voice is as smooth as they come and he doesn't \"overdo\" it in any of the tracks. I feel that he is a great blend of what it takes to be a relevant musical voice in the Kingdom.\n\nThis is one of those albums where my \"cherished\" song can change day to day. The first song to lead me to this album long ago was \"Isle of You\", which was a title that caught me initially because of it's play on words (as a poet\/write, I had to dig that). The song was so astonishing to me that I do wish that I would've known about it before my wedding - definitely a wedding song! I have to also say, though, that the title track is one of repentance that I can feel every word of. I have so much adore for the Fred Hammond original, \"Mender of Broken Hearts\", so much in fact that I would argue that the remake is just as high of quality as the original, which is certainly not always the case.\n\nAfter listening to this for a couple of years, I now have gotten caught up with \"Gray's Conclusion\", which to me is just as transparent as the majority of the album, but is the right summation of who Gray is as an imperfect man, but his effort to be the best that he was created by the Father. Truly, it served as the reiteration of the album's title - almost a continuation of \"Even With Evil With Me\" in it's own way.\n\nFor those who appreciate musical tastes of Jazz, R&B, and just message with the right message, this album is the one to go with. Every project since has been of distinguished quality. Keep your ears open for this man of God, because he has something important to share by way of his gift of music.","3313":"I WAS VERY DISCONCERTED.  IT IS ONLY PART OF A SONG.  I WOULD THINK THAT EVEN FOR 99 CENTS, YOU WOULD GET A WHOLE SONG.  PERCHANCE I DIDN'T NOTICE WHEN BUYING.  DID IT SAY YOU'D GET ONLY A PART OF THE SONG?  NOT ONLY THAT, THE PORTION OF THE SONG I GOT WAS NOT ACCESSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND.  THE BOOKS OF THE BIBLE THAT WERE ON THE CLIP SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENUNCIATED MORE CORRECTLY THAN THEY WERE. ALL IN ALL, NOT A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE AND THIS CLIP WILL NOT BE WORTH PLAYING FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN.","3314":"ADORE THIS SONG!!!!!. I sang it to my wife. Very well written by C. Gray. It can be uses as a wedding songz or anniversary songz","3315":"I have to agree entirely with the earlier criticism by CallMeGod.  The vocalist induces listening fatigue after the third or fourth song due to his whiny nasal and basically mundane vocal style.  He seems to have processed the main vocal with his own slightly de-tuned overdubbed back-up vocal )or applied some sort of effect - sounds a bit like Autotune to me), but the end result is essentially harsh, irritating and bothersome.  Nothing smooth or 'groove' about it at all.  It could be that the vocal melody line is just too flat all around, and no vocalist could have saved these songs, but whatever the dilemma is, this CD is a total miss.","3316":"I'm going to have to break off from the other criticisms written here.\n\nI have been listening to John Brown's Body (JBB) for a couple of years now, a really big fan of their sound and performance ever since I saw them live.\nFrom such older classics like \"Garden Tree\", \"Feel\" and even to more recent hits like \"Resonate\" and \"Picking Up.\" These songs range from having funky dub, laid back reggae, and all around feel-good music.\n\nRegrettably I can't say the same for this latest release from the group.\n\"Amplify\" sounds like an all-to-familiar attempt for the band to go more mainstream to bring in more fans. It's almost as they're arduous to hard, with songs like \"Amplify,\" with some joker rapper spitting verses towards the end of the song. A rapper? In Jbb? It sounds as crummy as it seems.\n\nOn top of this much more mainstream and at some points mundane melodies, they also adopt common and overdone vocal lines, evident in \"Push some air.\" Just listen to the first verse, and you'll know what I'm talking about.\nBut not all the songs are entire junk. The songs I did enjoy were coincidentally the ones that appeared way too similar to preceding classics. This is where \"Sky Juice\", \"Give yourself over\", and \"Zion triad\" fit nicely.\nThe rest of the songs fit in the void of a combination of genres that just don't work. Examples are \"So Aware\", which is a failed take of JBB arduous to make a adore song for teenagers to croon to each other, with the overuse of string instruments. \"Be at peace\" sounds like it was created for a Disney movie like Little Mermaid, when our two heroes fall in adore.\n\nBashing aside, I would not recommend this album to any JBB fans who enjoy their more magnum opus sound. \"Amplify\" strays far from the path, infusing more mainstream and gimmick sounding genres.","3317":"For over a decade, the American band John Brown's Body has continued to refine and improve upon their authentic roots reggae sound with each of their preceding four releases.  Their new CD `Amplify' contains diverse music that continues to direct this positive vibe in a fresh and exciting direction.  The 12 tracks on this release incorporate a myriad of influences ranging from toasting and psychadelia to dancehall, hip-hop and electronica. The instantly recognizable skank of reggae is still prominent throughout most of the tracks, but that usual format is altered, enhanced and cleverly rewoven into a unique sonic hybrid that almost defies categorization.\n\nElliot Martin, the bands lead singer and front man, possesses a distinctive voice that reveals itself in a multitude of vocalization techniques - forceful intonations and crisp, exact chatting can seamlessly flow into controlled intimacy or combine with his own splendid self-supporting back-up vocals.  His voice, blessed with a warm equalized tone, often is displayed utilizing controlled syllabic fluctuations which would make even the most confident verbalist jealous.  Mr. Martin is also the catalyst behind the well structured and conscious lyrics and he has shown increased confidence in his song craft that was evident on the 2002 release `Spirits All Around Us` and dominated on the distinguished 2005 CD `Pressure Points.`\n\n`Speak of the devil' is  a sinister effort built upon a one-drop riddim that warns the listener to be more aware and reconfirms that the righteous shall always prevail regardless of any forms of opposition.  Vaughn Benjamin of the group Midnite contributes a patois-intense vocal towards the end of the track, nicely complimenting the concrete solid dub rhythms.  `Skyjuice,' perchance the most imposing track on the release, is resplendent with intricately dense horns and tremendous groove-heavy beats from the always impressive drummer Tommy Benedetti.  `Ghost Notes,' infused with a heavy established skanking riff not heard since the days of early Aswad at their finest hour, is a mid-tempo reflective piece that pays due respect to the band's former bass player Scott Palmer, who passed away a few years ago.  The lyrics are poignant and display an ardent compassion seldom found in contemporary song writing.  \" Gave with every note he played, we won't be forgetful. \"\n\nWhile fundamentally faithful to the reggae vibe, John Browns Body creatively weaves rhythms and beats with layered instrumentation that provides a foundation for complex call and response vocals and splendid brass flourishes. The guitar work is tight and circulates amidst a variety of layered keyboard parts that act as a supportive framework throughout the songs.  Throughout the entire disc, innovative dub-friendly basslines enjoy enlightened interplay with crisp, bouncy drum beats.\n\nThe inclusion of exotic instrumentation such as the kora and violin take the galloping track `So Aware' outside the traditional reggae parameters to a subtle, worldly flavor echoing stylistic integrations used by North African Rai musicians.  Another contributing ingredient to the entire John Brown's Body sound are the exception production techniques that meticulously meld the surfeit of rhythms and beats with rich instrumentation, detailed harmonization and an enveloping use of atmosphere.  The editing is stellar and the expressive arrangements are entire with unexpected twists.  Live soundman and studio producer Jason `Jocko' Randall polishes the bands current creations enhancing the cross pollination of numerous musical rhythmic styles.  The result is a new style of music that possesses a vibe always loyal to the mystic, earthly tones of roots reggae while being inventive, groove-heavy and cool.\n\nJohn Brown's Body have established themselves as perchance America's most creative and dedicated reggae ensemble.  On `Amplify,' the latest incarnation of the band successfully executes a variety of moods that are ambitious and vibrantly experimental.  With the addition of new band members, Elliot Martin and Tommy Benedetti have embraced a new found sense of purpose and delivered a collection of compositions slightly ahead of its time. The music and lyrics demand that the listener's brain multitask to appreciate the sophisticated textures and depth of arrangements.  Nontheless you describe this music: groove music with reggae overtones or dubby electronica fusion roots, the final result is energetic, very original and ultimately impressive.","3318":"This set contains three CDs; the sound quality varies wildly among them. The second CD has good sound quality; nothing special, but good. The first CD has okay sound quality, although it sounds rather flat. The third CD, nontheless, has abysmal sound quality; rather than \"recorded live\", it sounds as if someone recorded it with their cell phone during a concert and then made bootleg copies off that recording. Guevara's voice is often lost in the background; the piano is loud but the quality of the sound is crummy; spoken words can barely be understood.  This is simply unacceptable in what is sold as a professionally produced CD. Conserve your cash, and don't acquire the set.","3319":"No More Invitations is one of the best cds I have ever heard. Jennifer's voice is silky smooth and I adore every song on there.

The sound production is unreal! Delooze, and the record label \"Gash Digital\" are producing some of the best beats today, period. This album, along with other Gash Digital releases have strong Deep French house influences (my cherished). Delooze is definitely an artist to keep an eye on. Supposedly she is releasing her first full length debut album soon! I'll be impatiently waiting for it. Nontheless, This album is absurdly good. The remixes are well worth the cash, and each one is DISTINCTLY different from one another, and they all sound unreal. Acquire it! Support Delooze! and this sort of music!! I hope she comes to the States, West Coast, LA :)","3326":"I rely on hypnosis tracks to go to sleep.  I am also an avid lucid dream participant.  When I got bored of listening to the same two (reliable) hypnosis tracks, I ventured out to seek something finer.  I acquired this album because of the 5 star criticism that the other user wrote and was enthusiastic to use it the same night I acquired it.  What could go wrong with a hypnosis album meant for lucid dreaming?\n\nI am not saying entirely that this album is crummy. There are good points that I would like to point out. First of all, the script used is very well pondered out. The trancey binaural tones in the background are flawless for the purpose of each track.  Regrettably, all this effort goes to misuse with meager mixing.  When the narrator's voice comes in quite suddenly, it is several decibels higher than these tones, causing you to jerk out of that trancey state.  After several failures from almost achieving a wake induced dream state, I began seeing horrifying distorted images of faces in my closed-eye visuals. So what went from a blissful state quickly turned into a nightmare until it was so unbearable I had to open my eyes.\n\nI gave the album a few more tries the following days, but again, I was jerked out of the trancey state and was never able to fall asleep. I don't recommend purchasing this album.  I am not discrediting the usefulness of hypnosis tracks, nor am I discouraging people from arduous to achieve a lucid dream. I am a firm believer of said two things, but this album is not what you want.","3327":"I grew up listening to this actual vinyl album at my Grandparents house. When they passed, I inherited the album. It is the only version I have ever heard. Therefore when I got this CD in the mail yesterday (after years of looking for it) I was super thrilled. The first thing I realized was that it is missing several tracks from the album (including 2 of my beloved). And yes, I now see that next to the title it says six songs, and they are making their own compilations (as I also now see in the description \"CD-R Note: This product is manufactured on demand when ordered from Amazon.com\".) So basically, they are burning their own CD's as they are ordered. I really do not enjoy that they are producing them, but please do not put an album cover on the product that NONE of the versions are from. It is misleading. I am 100% positive these are not the versions from the original album. Sarah Jackman's phone number on the original album is 418-9749. On this version it is 418-2792. Not that I am saying these versions aren't funny, just that I wanted the original versions from the original album. It looks like I am going to wind up converting a few of my Grandparents albums (Pat Cooper, Lou Monte, etc.) that you cannot get on CD myself. If you are not concerned with having the exact album versions, then this is fine. He is funny no matter what, but I was looking for the CD version of the ORIGINAL album.","3328":"Chico Buarque owes nothing to anyone--at least, this is true musically.  He has written some of the finest songs to come out of Brazil in the last 50 years.  Chico has synthesized multiples of cultures,untraditional harmonies and classical forms.  His lyric writing has been politically astute and, at times, carefully evasive.  And when writing of romance, myth, or social malaise, he has been acutely intelligent--without pandering to any school or transient phase.  And this doesn't even take into consideration his plays, ballets, novels, and commentary.\n\nSadly, he has not produced much affecting music in the last 20 years (\"Dois Irmaos\" of 1990 is his last worthy effort).  This cd, like his last four or four albums, is an extrusion of meandering melodies and earnest, but uninteresting chord progressions (still--some very nice open-string harmonies). My Portuguese is not as good as it should be, so I don't think I amcomfortable judging his \"letras.\" I look forward to a fair assessment from another of his admirers (there are legions, justifiably so).\n\nI will always purchase Chico cd;s because his lowest efforts exceed almost any one thing produced in the pop vein outside of Brazil.  But this one is not memorable.  \"O Quw Sera\" is the apogee of Chico's work.  I don't know if he is capable of reaching that height anymore.","3329":"The rating doesn't not in any way reflect on the merits of Nazareth's output--it only examines this specific product. This seems to good to be true--an FLAC anthology of Nazareth's catalog on one CD. And indeed it is:\n1. Although it doesn't claim to be the entire compendium, the anthology is missing two albums--\"Close Enough for Rock N' Roll\" and \"The Fool Circle.\"\n2. The disc, despite the printed legal disclaimers and warnings, is a budged Russian bootleg, and not of a high echelon--the flies do not feature any accompanied artwork--it's bare bones, sound files only.\n3. The sound quality is generally fine, except the defect on some files on \"Play 'N' The Game.\"\n4. In some cases, the albums feature bonus tracks, but in some (ex: \"Expect No Mercy\"), they do not.\nEven with such shortcoming, it may be worth buying just for the wealth of astonishing material that it does have, but don't try ordering it from Round3--you will get a CD of Soviet military choirs, guaranteed. They sent me same wrong disc twice, each time re-listing the Nazareth disc with a price hike, so it went from $11 to now $20. You can find this disc for $11 elsewhere, but if you're shopping for a compact medium of Nazareth catalog, you may want to look into other similar anthologies, for example, the two disc versions.","3330":"Let me say that I Adore Rod Stryker's \"3 Meditations to Live By\" CD (pureyoga version).  They are the backbone of my daily meditation and I use them frequently.  So when I found out that Rod had released this CD of meditations I acquired them straight away, along with Meditations for Inner and Outer Peace.\n\nI have now done all of the meditations on Four Desires.  The Bliss meditation is my cherished in this set. I noticed straight away that 2 of the meditations in this set are ones that Rod has recorded before.  The Healing the Heart meditation on this CD is the same as the \"Empowering the Heart\" meditation that I have on my precious 3 Meditations to Live By CD.  And of course, the Relax into Greatness meditation has been recorded on the CD released previously with the same name.\n\nI found that listening to the meditations with headphones appeared lots finer to me than listening to it through my stereo.  Something about running the sound through the speakers seemed to make the little imperfections in sound more noticable.\n\nIt's really a great set of meditations.  The only reason I'm giving this product 4 stars rather of 5 is the delivery by Rod.  He just seemed more....caring and into it on 3 Meditations to Live By (as an example).  His delivery on these CDs seems quite a bit more \"business-like\" and matter of fact.  Also, there's no chime at the end of each meditation, so sometimes I'm not sure if the meditation is done or not unless I look at my iPod (transferred the CD).\n\nBut a great set overall....recommended.","3331":"Very good product. Happy with my purchase.","3332":"I really loathe giving a reduced rating, but I have to honestly say, this CD is a failure on several fronts.\n\nThe first dilemma is the anachronistic temperament (system of tuning).  It is a Renaissance-era tuning, from at least 100 years before Pachelbel, suited for music of one or two keys, and possibly a very few closely related keys, but certainly not for every key, or the wide variety of keys that Pachelbel (or anyone from his era) composed for.\n\nI was thinking this must be an organ built in the 1500s and tuned with a temperament of that era, which would sound authentic with music by, for example, Scheidt and Sweelinck.  One could certainly play next to nothing by J.S. Bach on such an organ, and little by Pachelbel for that matter.  Now is it possible Pachelbel may have encountered such an organ tuned that way in his lifetime?  Perchance, perchance, I'm not saying it wasn't possible.  But I consider it supremely doubtful he would have just sat down on played any one thing, in any key, on it.  He would have said, 'Oh dear, one of these anciently tuned monstrosities, let us see if we can find a good program only in these complementary keys.'\n\nImagine my surprise to read the liner notes and find (A) no mention whatsoever of the (admittedly intricate) topic of temperament.  So the user is just left to wonder why the thing sounds so freakin' out-of-tune.  And more surprisingly ... (B) the organ is not from the 1500s at all, it was constructed in 1702.  FINE, the shoe has dropped;  the temperament is simply wrong.  That was only 4 years before Pachelbel died;  it was during J.S. Bach's teenage years when he was supposedly doing crazy things like the Toccata and Fugue in D minor and none of them were restricted to those vanilla keys.  I presume all church organs of era, certainly NEW church organs of the era which would attract great living composers and performers, were MUCH more oriented in mild temperaments that were friendly or at least usable in \"MOST\" keys.  I cannot accept this organ of the High Baroque being tuned in this manner.  MY OPINION!\n\nIf you want authenticity in old music, the instrument (and temperament) must match the composer's ideal, not simply be \"OLD\".  Otherwise, it's like taking a horse and buggy to the drive-thru window at the 1950's burger joint.  Yes, historic, but totally the wrong time period.\n\nAnd in case anyone is wondering ... temperament is decided by the tuner, not the organ builder or rebuilder.  So, yes, FYI ... this tuning was set by the most recent tuner.  It could be made into modern equal temperament, or one of the 'well-tempered' Baroque temperaments, by the NEXT tuner (with permission of the owner of course, which I hope they would give).  FYI.\n\nThe other dilemma with this CD is that it is played \"introspectively\" and very little joy or full-organ sound we are used to hearing from decades of other organ recordings.  Why that is, I can only speculate.  It was the organist's decision.\n\nHere are a few thoughts on each track.\n\n(1) Toccata in E minor - does not sound good in this temperament.  Also, played delicately and with many registration changes.  This is a first year piece, quite accessible and I would prefer to hear it played robustly, beginning to end.\n\n(2) Allein zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ - in two sections.  The first is not ideal in this temperament, but tolerable.  The second is very sweet indeed.  The music is very simple, I have played it at Lutheran funerals.\n\n(3) Wir glauben all' an einen Gott - This has a supremely decorated chorale melody, making it undiscernable (to me at least).  Of course, that is Pachelbel's doing, not the organist's.  I appreciate he is playing it strongly and at a clippy tempo.  This one does not suffer much from the temperament.\n\n(4) Wie schoen leuchtet der Morgenstern - This will be one of the few hymn tunes possibly recognizable by a modern (Lutheran) churchgoer:  O Morning Star, How Fair and Bright.  It is delicately played and easily recognizable.  The temperament is not a detriment.\n\n(5) An Wasserflussen Babylon - FINE.\n\n(6) Fantasia in G minor - Temperament sounds FINE in this key.  I would have preferred a little more aggressiveness, it is played introspectively.\n\n(7) Ein feste Burg - A Mighty Fortress.  Without a doubt the most recognizable hymn arrangement on this CD, and indeed what I acquired the CD for.  This is the piece I played on 500th Reformation day in church last Sunday.  I am unhappy to say, the temperament does not do this piece credit--it simply sounds like a neglected, out-of-tune organ.  Or at best, one which Pachelbel would have said, 'Unhappy, it looks like we can't use this particular organ for this particular piece' ... in my opinion.  Also I am disconcerted it is not played very joyfully.\n\n(8) Chaconne in D minor.  Temperament FINE but again not played with much fire.\n\n(9) Allein Gott in der Hoh sei Ehr - How about a nice little single 8 and 2 for a change?\n\n(10) Fugue in D minor.  The chromatic step-wise fugue subject shows precisely why we need a more equal-tempered or at least well-tempered tuning to perform Pachelbel.\n\n(11) Toccata in F.  Once again, far too restrained, although the temperament sounds good here.\n\n(12) Nun lob, mein Seel', den Herren - FINE.\n\n(13) Toccata in C minor.  I have just figured it out.  He must have been playing at 1:00 AM and didn't want to disturb the neighbors.\n\n(14) Werde munter, mein Gemute.  Another one of the rare hymn tunes which may be likely recognized by lay people today.  FINE, I do not expect fireworks on this piece.\n\n(15) Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her.  Another finer-known Christmas hymn, \"From Heaven Above\", which may be familiar to many traditional parishioners ... although not saying it is normally played from Kmart speakers during Christmas season :) Now, get this:  AARGH!  The one piece I would like to hear gently and introspectively, THIS is where he decides to pull all the stops and play full organ.  (It is a conspiracy against me! :)\n\n(16) Meine Seele erhebt der Herren - not familiar with this piece, sounds FINE.\n\n(17) Magnificat Fugue Sexti Toni - At last, another fugue played joyfully, high time!\n\n(18) Prelude in D minor - Especially as a closing piece of a recital, he had the opportunity to turn this into a blazing ball of fire, and rather was very careful and conservative.\n\nNote, I mentioned the Lutheran religion several times and only because my first organ job was at a Lutheran church and I have an affinity for those chorales.  Very few of them are done at the other various Protestant churches ....\n\nThere is not a great deal of Pachelbel organ music recorded but there are several others available which I own and can supremely recommend:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Gerd-Wachowski\/dp\/B0000021H9\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gerd Wachowski<\/a>&nbsp;- most supremely recommended, stunning recording\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Werner-Jacob\/dp\/B00000DP64\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Werner Jacob<\/a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Joseph-Payne\/dp\/B01K8LP0MI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Joseph Payne<\/a>&nbsp;- on a fine little organ I have spent some time with :)\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Mary-Jane-Newman\/dp\/B00000J8E8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mary Jane Newman<\/a>&nbsp;- entire Fugues on the Magnificat","3333":"I own this CD and \"Johnny Has Gone for a Soldier\" is hauntingly alluring.  I adore Suzy Boggus' delivery of the song, which makes me feel the pain of the woman-in-adore left behind because her adore has gone to war.  I adore each song on this CD - and adore that it preserves so many American folk songs and puts them in their best light.  My beloved include \"Froggy Went a'Courtin'\" and \"Rock Island Line.\"  \"Froggy\" uses a Jew Harp which makes the song so much lively!  and \"Rock Island Line\" has a great rhythm.  Suzy almost \"updates\" the music while managing to be true to the original song.  (I don't know how she does that!)\n\nI don't remember if I acquired the CD via Amazon, but I have paid to download a few of Suzy's songs from Amazon for access to personal devices.","3334":"I have almost all Sophie Zelmani's albums, and this is the one I least liked on first listen. It appeared bland and, dare I say it, mundane. Then I loaded it on my FLAC player and started playing it when I went walking at dusk every day. Within the next two listens this album had me mesmerized and is now my cherished Zelmani album.\n\nThe album consists almost exclusively of ballads...backed up by some of the most alluring acoustic guitar work you can hope to hear. The songs are mostly about adore lost. Ready is the leader of the pack here and has to be one of her best songs ever. It gets ample support from the rest of the material.\n\nThe only song that feels slightly out of place is Interior Design, and it would perchance have been finer at the end of the album. The alternative version of To Know You (found on a preceding album) is also negligible and not finer than the original version.\n\nI'm The Rain is a fine album, and lovers of acoustic guitar driven ballads in particular will find plenty to appreciate.","3335":"I was interested in listening to this historical recording of a Handel opera that does not get recorded much. I was very disconcerted. The sound quality was ghastly. I fathom we are not used anymore to how crummy things appeared back then. I was more disconcerted at what I missed - it all indicated that the singers had great voices. Some sound engineering would go a long way to provide a quality recording. At least the price I paid was very low","3336":"This is misrepresented by appearing to have been recorded by the REAL Celtic Woman group. It is not them at all. The voices on this are almost monotone and there is little musical background to enjoy. Don't misuse your cash like I did.","3337":"I first saw these guys on the Hour of Power giving their story of how they came up and was impressed. Even more impressed with their sound and lyrics when they sang. I acquired their CD right away and look forward to hearing the next. God Bless GB5","3338":"This CD is the silliest music and lyrics I have ever acquired.  Absolutely nothing to do with peaceful, tranquil music for sauna as stated on the cover of the CD.  I would not even put it on for a party.  I suggest to people who performed on that CD to quickly change career.","3339":"Not only is the music moving, beautifully arranged and performed by a group of stellar musicians, the proceeds of this album go to God's children around the world. Through Crabb Sr. with Servants of the King, cash from this album goes to building orphanages, schools, leprosoriums, hospitals, and churches in India and Africa.\nI have always felt strange about buying something in order to give cash to God's people, but in this case I truly would have acquired it anyway. Win\/win? Sure. Then I factor in the increasing burden I have felt to give back, to change the world, to see the Kingdom grow... I asked God yesterday morning to give me a way to show the world, specifically children, His adore. Then I heard about this album. Wow. So, really it's just another day I ask myself, \"If we aren't the Body, who is?\"","3340":"When I ordered it I pondered I was going to get at least 3 CD's covering his work like the best of Andrea Crouch which I acquired a few years ago. But I only received 1 . That to me is daylight robbery. There is no justification for 1 CD to cost $60.00 . Left me with a crummy taste in my mouth. Plus the sender was very rude and silly in their response to me.","3341":"Adore it!!  He had such a smooth sound...his music sounds as good now as 50 years ago. Using this song in the ad is great!","3342":"I really wish I could give this a positive criticism, because I was down with the concept - nerdy pop songs for comic fanboys (& girlz). Regrettably, the acoustic pop-ballad approach just isn't working for me. I'm sure this will go over big with the audience that acquired the (pop music) \"soundtrack album\" CDs for the Batman & Spider-Man movies, but musically, it's just too simple for me. I was hoping for an upbeat power-pop thing with playful riffs and hooks, perchance along the lines of Weezer or The Apples In Stereo, but this isn't it. There's a sameness to it, from one song to the next. The songs themselves are well-written and I can appreciate all the comic book references, but I just can't imagine listening to this more than once or twice. Too crummy, but good thing Amazon had samples to listen to. I almost acquired this unheard, based solely on positive criticisms and the nerd-band concept. Oh well, can't win 'em all.\n\nYour mileage may vary, as they say in the commercials. Feel free to lambaste me with your \"don't listen to this guy\" comments.","3343":"Ghastly! If you want to hear someone in broken English sing Amy Winehouse (in the lowest tribute ever to her great music), you will like this. Entire misuse of cash (even a small incremental amount is too much for this)!","3344":"Trace Adkins has always been a first-rate song stylist, able to project gargantuan emotional power and stylistic range.  All of his classiness and talent gets erased, though, by \"More Of Us,\" a bonus track on the \"deluxe edition\" where he embraces the most corrosive aspects of \"tea party\" politics, first playing the victim card by whining about the imaginary oppression of \"us\" true-blue, red-blooded, God-loving, flag-waving Americans and calling for \"real Americans\" to \"push back\" against the nasty people who supposedly loathe God and need to be reminded that \"there's more of us than there are of them.\"\n\nNow, I'm pretty sure that I have a few political differences with Mr. Adkins and whoever wrote this song, but I gotta say, it really ticks me off to have them talk about me -- and other people -- as though I don't deserve to live in America and that having a different point of view makes me some kind of a traitor. I was born in America, I adore this country, I pay my taxes, I go to church and I vote in every election, and I have as much right to my beliefs as anyone else. Talking about \"double-checking\" who the real Americans are is probably the single most un-American, unpatriotic act that anyone could make, including big Nashville stars. We're all Americans, and we should respect one another -- that's part of loving America.\n\nThis kind of tough talk and destructive, violent, let's-have-a-civil-war, chest-thumping might sell a few records, but it isn't going to help solve any problems. Frankly I'm disconcerted and embarrassed to hear one of my cherished modern artists sink so low. You should be ashamed, Mr. Adkins. This is truly unworthy of your talent. (Axton)","3345":"This compilation features some distinguished Jamaican roots music, and is well worth a listen. In particular the smoldering performance by Hortense Ellis, Alton Ellis's sister, on \"Hell and Sorrow,\" and Errol Dunkley's re-imagining of the song as \"Black Cinderella,\" are worth the price of admission not to mention Big Youth's run on another version.\n\nOn top of that, you've got another great Dunkley tune and some magnum opus tracks from Leroy Smart, including of course \"Mother Liza.\"\n\nThe only drawback, I'd say, is that the versions come so hot and heavy. From \"Hell and Sorrow\" to August Pablo's \"Cinderella in Black,\" all the way to \"Zion Youth\" by Vin Goron, you get 6 versions in a row on the same riddim comprehensive, sure, and unquestionably filler-free. Still, neophytes into the world of Jamaican music may get some ear fatigue.\n\nNonetheless, 5 stars all the way.","3346":"Very depressing sound quality. Monaural, center-channel only. I have the CD's for other The Hot Sardine music and they are a good group. Too crummy this collection is so poorly presented to the public.","3347":"This album is astonishing! The pipes and fiddle are so locked in with each other, it takes me to a place of pure happiness. This is great adrenaline music, too. In my car whenever I hear the pipes drone start, and then Mick's chanter busts in, I turn up the volume and drive a little faster. And, great tunes, too.","3348":"Dude... pronunciation is ghastly. I appreciate the belief of having a non-native speaker perchance be less intimidating, but at least find someone who can say the words correctly. This is teaching butchering of a alluring language. I appreciate the effort bro, but this is just not right.","3349":"Yessss! I adore Kirk Franklin and this song has a nice funky beat with an awe-inspiring and pertinent message for everyone, any day!","3350":"This song sounds great when one can find a decent recording. The FLAC from Amazon is a \"no-go.\"\n\nSOUND QUALITY\n1. iPad with built-in speaker: Tolerable.\n2. iPad with Apple Ear-buds: Obviously limited frequency range, clearly sticks out from other songs: marginal\n3. IPad with Sennheiser 500 over the ear headphones: limited frequency range; \"pushed\" dynamic range. Distortion ruins what little of the song which remains.\n4. Denon\/Martin-Logan\/Bi-amped Polk LSi tower speakers: \"Could someone please turn that off?\"\n\nDILEMMA\nWell, there can't be too much of a dilemma when the song was less than a dollar, right?  Yet, other songs in the same price range are consistently worth 4-stars in Sound Quality (the limit of sound quality for an FLAC, based on the amount of lossy compression applied). What transpired?\n1. Too much of an attempt to increase the dynamic range through use of a compressor on the final mix-down track?\n2. A multi-generation recording, in which multiple forms of compression and conversion had been used. Where's the Master?\n3. Product Quality Control. Granted, Amazon QA listeners can only listen to so many songs before their head feels like it's about to explode! I am sure an existing application can be tweaked to analyze each contributed song for preset frequency range requirements, dynamic range requirements, harmonic distortion levels and other audio specifications. Those songs that are rejected, can be listened to, to determine if the song is intentionally manipulating sounds for effects purposes, and passed or failed. To send this song out, at any cost, is a meager reflection of the Music Services offered by Amazon, or any other music distributor.","3351":"Another song as a narrative for a moment\nin Prime Time TV.\nI heard this during a very bitter episode of NBC'S\nMiami Vice. The background vocals are timed\nperfectly, they are alluring, & they sound\nlike a church choir; Gospel in fact.\nThe title of this song is universal, the search\nfor adore is something that we adults look for\nall the time. Yes, we want to know what ADORE is\nwhen we are hurt by what we pondered ADORE\nwas. Especially when we gave, & feel we didn't\nreceive.. A Alluring song that raises a life\nquestion that calls for definition by faith in \nADORE.","3352":"I listened to the samples on this album and think Ronan was the wrong person to interpret Burt's songs. The singing isn't very good and I can't warm to his voice at all - it's like he's arduous to make Burt's music sound cool for today's generation, but it backfires on him, as his voice sounds really, really shocking in places.  I saw this album at another store today, and pondered, should I acquire blindly? I'm so glad I didn't, as I would have been extremely disconcerted.\n\nThe last singer I enjoyed (who collaborating with Burt)  was Elvis Costello on the Painted from Memory album. I really enjoyed his singing and the orchestrations for that album. Sadly, there is no warming endorsements here from me. I enjoyed Ronan when he was in Boyzone, and adore music of the 1960s, but this album is one I won't be buying.","3353":"Depressing-- and the initial music for each section becomes bothersome.  I should have looked more carefully at the headings--- way too many \"numbers\" and not nearly enough Italian conversation\/phrases.","3354":"As with their preceding SACD releases, the German recording label Tacet manages to brilliantly capture a splendid performance by the Polish Chamber Orchestra, led by Wojciech Rajsk. The timbre of the instruments feels almost palpable. And that's exactly why this disc is so frustrating. In order to hear these unreal musicians at work, one has to endure the overly affected narration that permeates the performance. On top of that, Prokofiev's original text in Peter and the Wolf was forsaken for a new and extended one as told by an owl, while Saint-Sans's Carnival of the Animals got a totally new narration where originally there was none. These changes dilute the music, robbing the works of their natural continuity.\n\nThis is undoubtedly a subjective assessment, since the overall length of this Peter and the Wolf at 31:32 is just a few minutes longer than Andre Previn on a Telarc CD at 27.22. Nevertheless, it does feel like an eternity when one is so eager to hear more of the music, although kids might actually enjoy the experience, and they are after all, the target audience.\n\nAs for Tacet's so-called Moving Surround Sound, despite some unorthodox shifts in the placement of the instruments, it is done rather creatively and fits the playful mood of this specific repertoire, at least as far the stereo SACD layer is concerned. Regrettably though, the narration takes center stage most of the time and left me wishing for Peter and the hunters to leave the wolf alone and go rather after the meager fellow doing the honors.","3355":"I don't know...Perchance i gave this two stars because i just can't stand to admit these guys have absolutely lost it.\nThe songs are weak, the playing uninspired, the production limp and the singing just sounds tired.\nI fathom i'll stand by the two stars as it's slightly finer than the last record, but damn, i used to really adore these guys and hard rock rarely gets finer than their 2nd record Get Used To It.","3356":"I am going to write this criticism as unbiased as possible.  And I do accept responsibility for taking a chance on buying this CD as it was a.) mixed by someone I never heard of b.) it was coming from the Czeck Republic and c.) there were no other criticisms to go by.\n\nWhat I was hoping to get was a compilation disk - containing a number of dnb artists like Teebee and Stakka & Skynet that fall into the nerofunk\/futurestep category of this genre - to me one of the most creative, unique and progressive areas of dnb that mix together spacey verbed out sinister atmosphere's, hard, edgy heavily filtered dark and evil synth\/bass lines, and beats that are along the techstep line but have more presence and are generally at a slightly slower tempo around 170-175 beats per minute.\n\nWhile the disk did include the artists I mentioned above, rather than expanding upon the sounds of nerofunk\/futurestep Koogi chose to absolutely soften (marshmellowize if I can coin a term) the experience by mixing a chill, loungy, groove oriented set targeted to the martini bar hipster crowd.\n\nThe dark and sinister tones of minor and disonant keys used in nerofunk\/futurestep were transposed to more \"accessible on the ear\" sounding major keyes - the pads were joyous and elated rather of being mean and ominous.  The basslines were subdued rather of hitting your mind like a right hook, and gorgeous sounding female vocals were overlayed throughout, which I just don't get as this ain't supposed to be HOUSE.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are looking for a good neurofunk\/futurestep experience, take a pass.  If you want to try out something in dnb and like chill grooves this may be interesting to you.\n\nOn a final note, Koogi does mix well, the quality of the sound is very good and I received the CD very quickly even though it came from Eastern Europe.","3357":"Had heard it on Pandora and extremely disconcerted to find that only 2 tracks were relaxing!  So 1 star per track!  Perchance cd version with the three cds is finer.but sure threw cash away on this one!  Sampled are deceiving.","3358":"OMG, I just listened to the sample of this soundtrack, and I honestly can't imagine sleeping to this, even if I was really, really tired. Much less using it to go to sleep if I was having insomnia....\n\nFor soundtracks that actually work, you want something with Binaural Beat Technology built in, and a soothing backgound sound. Distinguished ones you can get from Amazon include Kelly Howell's one with the identical title, Slow Wave Sleep, with a ocean wave background. And if like me you find ocean wave sounds less than ideal, Kelly's Sound Sleep has a very restful musical background. Just type Kelly Howell into Amazon's search box.\n\nSadly, Amazon doesn't have samples of Kelly' soundtrack's on it's site, but Kelly's site does. Google BrainSync. You can listen to samples there, and acquire an FLAC download cheaper than a CD. But if you want a cd rather than an FLAC download, come back here to acquire it, since Kelly charges too much for shipping and still takes a while to deliver.\n\nIt's a matter of debate among producers of soundtracks, but some people claim that a CD will work finer than a FLAC copy, since the binaural beats are compressed in a FLAC. Possibly true, but the MP3s do work. Do they work as well as a CD? I really don't know....\n\nBe aware that these soundtracks are designed to slowly take you down into the sleep state, gradually going deeper and deeper. If you are having trouble going to sleep, listening to them will most likely get you there. Even if not, you will at least get very calm, which is much more restful than tossing and turning. But listening to them over and over all night will be counterproductive, since when the soundtrack starts over, it returns to the \"awake\" level, and then spends some time \"taking you down\" again.\n\nAnother use is when you need a \"nap\" in order to be awake and alert later, or simply don't have time for a full nights sleep. These soundtracks will help get you rested and energised.\n\nWarning: binaural beat technology works by putting different sound frequencies in each ear. So unless you have a stereo source, at least moderate hearing in each ear, and use stereo headphones they won't do any one thing at all.","3359":"Misuse of cash! This song was only seconds long and not worth paying for.","3360":"This album has been (and still is, as far as I'm concerned) way overdue for CD release. Not one of Randy Bachman's best efforts but still quite worthy,and I was thrilled to finally be getting a CD copy, as my vinyl is worn out. Regrettably, this album was \"remastered\" at THE WRONG SPEED. \"Side One\" plays too fast, and all three vocalists sound like chipmunks. There is a humorous element to hearing the baritone growl of Fred Turner pitched up to alto, but overall a gargantuan failure. I would normally grade this album at three to four stars, but until it's mastered at the right speed, it gets zero stars from me. Kinda weird that \"side two\" plays fine....I don't understand how \"half\" an album gets mastered wrong.

I don't enjoy if it's the single, people will eat up what is popular. But to a Mutemath fan, this is very bland and uninspiring.

Mutemath is finer than that and I hope their next album goes back to the atmospheric rock sound. They are just too good at it to just absolutely abandon it.","3362":"The guys of MUTEMATH are extremely talented. But I'm just not digging their new sound at all. This isn't what brought me in to the alluring rock that MM was. The self-titled album had some of the most astonishing songs I've ever heard by a band. Armistice had its gems too. But this new album seems like they're reverting back to the 70s. I just miss that atmospheric rock sound that MM had that made them one of my cherished bands. After listening to the new album, I can say I am thoroughly disconcerted. \"All or Nothing\" and \"In No Time\" are astonishing tracks. Other than that, all the songs sound pretty much the same. Crazy drum fills along with 70s style guitar riffs. If you were a fan of their preceding albums\/sound, be careful. This is nothing like how they were.....and that's a crummy thing.","3363":"I acquired the MP-3 of Adeste Fidelis from the album SOUNDIES'HOLIDAY by Frankie Laine and the Ewing Sisters, only the Ewing Sisters were omitted. This is the second piece of music I 've acquired in which the Ewing Sisters were credited but nonexistant on the recordings. The other omission was on the album The Best of Gordon MacRae The Early Years in the song Use Your Imagination. I had mentioned this in an earlier Written Criticism. I would have listened to the MP-3 prior to buying it but my laptop was on the \"Fritz\". I'm collecting music by the Ewing Sisters and I expect to hear them When they are credited on a recording. Frnakie at least was on the recording.

From the first song with the cheesy chipmunk sounding electric keyboards (I fathom a synthesizer or something along those lines), the 3rd song - the majority of which sounds like a melody or riff taken from an early King Crimson song, crummy vocals, to the overall cheesy sounding pompous nature of the keyboard effects, lyrics, and overall sound.  It does get somewhat finer when you get to I fathom what was the final song on the original release (What Is  Is What, the 4th track on the CD) and the following final song, which I fathom is a bonus 5th track added to this Japanese import.  The last song is just some electronic doodling (instrumental), but listenable (sort of reminds me of Kit Watkins or someone like that).  I think this was supposed to be their second and last release that actually was not released until a few years after it was recorded.  After hearing it, Im surprised it was released at all; but like I indicated the 4th song, which I fathom was side 2 of the original vinyl clocking in at 19:51 minutes, is somewhat listenable (I say only somewhat).  I was thinking about also getting their first release, but NOT anymore after hearing this one.","3365":"...and who the hell is the target audience for this stale product? Middle-aged white racists who make a ton of cash but are eager to prove themselves as \"working class\"? North is a fraud and shameless self-promoter.

If I.... If I... If I... The Songs of Squeeze Revisited is a 4-disc, 50-track album covering Squeeze's first four albums (U.K Squeeze, Cool For Cats, Argybargy, and East Side Story) in their entirety and in their original track sequence.  Check out the songs of Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook in a whole new light - it is a fabulous listen!  (The 4-CD album is ONLY available from the Burning Sky Records website).\n\nReleased in 1977, the John Cale-produced U.K. Squeeze introduced the world to the magic of Squeeze.  The album presented Squeeze at their wildest - they had an edge to their sound that was unique to this record.\n\nCovering an album like U.K. Squeeze would be a challenge.  We strove to capture the wild abandon of the original album while giving fresh life to each of its songs.  Here's a brief take on the tracks, with some thoughts from the bands\/artists themselves:\n\n1.) Sex Master - After a gorgeous, Jellyfish-esque opening, US band Steve Sizemore Group rocks the heck out of the album opener, with guitar, piano and Hammond organ all \"rocking it out like the world was coming to an end.\"\n\n2.) Bang Bang - UK band Keshco provides a lively, quirky take on the song, \"playing up the whimsy in the verses and the yearning in the choruses,\" with a \"funk-out at the end\" to \"top off all that pent-up frustration.\"\n\n3.) Strong In Reason - US artist Christopher Watson provides an updated New Wave take on the track.  \"What started out sweet and tentative became edgy, taut, and mechanical,\" Chris says. The track also features cool angular guitar from Trees' Dane Conover.\n\n4.) Wild Sewerage Tickles Brazil - Japanese band Penny and Ashtray take a surreal approach to the album's lone instrumental - they strove to \"represent the song's alter ego in a parallel world.\"  Their cover has all of the delicious creepiness of the original version.\n\n5.) Out Of Control - Speaking of \"creepiness,\" US band Trees amps up the creepiness appropriate to the lyric while at the same time making a very catchy cover.  Trees' Dane Conover wanted listeners to have \"little beads of sweat trickle down their forehead\" when listening to this one.\n\n6.) Take Me I'm Yours - US band (by way of England) Sartre's Lobster give this magnum opus Squeeze track a decidedly Middle Eastern feel, using the song's \"lyrics about bellydancers, camels and the Golden East\" as a starting point, swirling with a \"a kind of '70s, vaguely Led Zeppelin-esque vibe.\"\n\n7.) The Call - US band Robert Mag & The Number Nine put a forceful, Bowie-esque slant on this track, rocking it up more than the original version - very cool stuff.\n\n8.) Model - UK band The Slingsby Hornets amp up the energy on this track, employing \"a Brian May multi layered guitar feel, over a 90s influenced Redd Kross style powerpop\/glam backing, with the addition of a few analogue synth sounds.\"\n\n9.) Remember What - Spanish (by way of the US) artist Amelia Ray considered numerous potential approaches to the song, \"but the funk won out\" on this inspired cover. The majority of the song is sung in 7\/8 time, with the bridges switching to 4\/4.  It is funky indeed!\n\n10.) First Thing Wrong - US band Ocean of Algebra \"took a very loose and open approach to the song, and \"ended up getting kind of an Ocean of Algebra does the New York Dolls does Squeeze type of sound.\"  Singer Jim Hiskey's vocal is not to be missed!\n\n11.) Hesitation (Rool Britannia) - US artist D A Karkos takes what I always felt was a so-so song from U.K. Squeeze and turns it into something astonishing. Karkos says, \"My approach to this song was pretty simple. I wanted to make it more of a hard rock song and less of a jam. Slowing the down the tempo and coming up with a new riff that worked over the original chord progression seemed to do the trick.\"  I'll say!  This cover is flat-out sick!\n\n12.) Get Smart - US artist Wayne Cabral closes the disc with a blistering take on the track, dialing up the energy while maintaining the \"punkabilly\" feel of the original.  Clocking in at just over 2 minutes, this track (and disc) will leave you wanting more!  Good thing there are 3 more discs to go... :)","3368":"Never heard of the Damn Quails before, but they were recommended by Amazon based on some other music I had acquired. I acquired this CD  based on that and listening to some of the previews sound loops. I was not at all disconcerted. The CD is distinguished from beginning to end. The Dam Quails are great song crafters and superb musicians. If you like bands like the Jayhawks, Turnpike Troubadours and others in that vein, you will adore this band and this CD.","3369":"We used to hear this occasionally on the way to school on Kids Place Live (XM).  My daughter loved this song, I downloaded it from Amazon onto my phone and she wore my battery down listening to it over and over.  The song is very good and imaginative, constantly switching up styles and beats, we have listened to it very often since I acquired it and we haven't gotten tired of it yet.  It is not repetitive, and it does not have any tween\/teen themes (thinking about Justin Beiber as one example.)\n\nThis beats a lot of the kids music genre that I have heard by a long shot.  I have acquired the rest of this album based solely on this song.","3370":"It's about time I shared my life-changing experience with three of Michael J. Emery's recordings:\n\n1.  Entire Confidence 2.0\n2.  Put Off Procrastination\n3.  Sheer Resolve To Do What It Takes\n\n- Did these three recordings alone change everything? No.\n\n- Did they start me, and then keep me, on a path I was previously unlikely to take or stay on without them? Yes!\n\n- Had I struggled similar recordings, such as hypnosis and books, to accomplish the same things, and did Emery's recordings prove by far the most effective? Yes!\n\nAt the time of this writing, September 17, 2015, I have never met nor communicated with Michael J. Emery. This testimonial comes from the influence of the recordings themselves, listened to over a period of about a year.\n\nThe two elements I presume stand these recordings out from others like them are:\n\n1) The music and sound effects that accompany Emery's verbal instructions and imagery. The music is, in my experience, simultaneously relaxing and stimulating. In fact, listening intently, fully conscious, to each of these recordings and their instructions at least twice is an distinguished way to learn how to call upon their techniques during a normal workday without the recordings.\n\n2) The most effective image\/sound effect for me personally, in any audio recording I've ever listened to, is an \"ice cube\" metaphor on \"Entire Confidence 2.0\" designed to gather, freeze, and put away all thoughts of preceding failure, so that I could proceed building confidence without mental hang-ups from the past. My unconscious truly responded to this metaphor.\n\nWith these recordings, I was able to build \"Entire Confidence\" in a way I had not been able to sustain before under pressure.\n\nThis prompted me to \"Put Off Procrastination\" and act on a number of decisions I had waffled over before, which prompted me within a short time to seek out and then join a public speaking club which I still belong to, and led me soon after to apply for promotion to a leadership position I had not fully seized the first time it had come around, increasing my income significantly.\n\nFor those with a \"fear of success\" similar to what I felt for many years before seeking out and listening to these recordings, I won't lie to you - bold decisions lead to responsibilities that can be difficult to stick with once assumed. \"Sheer Resolve To Do What It Takes\" kept me on the path, bolstered me in refusing to give up, and kept me focused on thriving rather than just \"getting through\" challenging situations.\n\n\"Entire Confidence\" continued to bolster that indispensable element, and \"Put Off Procrastination\" continued to provide tangible effects that prompted me to act on, and drive steadily to completion (or lead others steadily to completion), important tasks that had lost momentum but still needed to be done.","3371":"This is a criticism to Verdi's La Traviata, recorded in 1941.  I see it is already attached to La Boheme, and Lord knows where else, by Amazon.  It is their doing, not mine.  Now about this Traviata ...\n\nI am a big fan of Jan Peerce and particularly regretful of the fact I didn't go hear him live, although I had the chance staring me in the eyes and stepping on my toes.  It was about 1980 and he was doing Traviata at Scottsdale Center for the Arts.  I was all dressed up and ready to go, and then I read a criticism in the paper which said it was ridiculous to have a 76-year-old Alfredo hobbling around the stage with a cane.  And so, because I was stupid, I pondered, oh dear--I don't want anyone to see me there, if the reviewer pondered it was crummy.  And so I missed out.  Now he is dead, and the moral of the story is:  don't be stupid, and miss out.\n\nWell, this particular recording is interesting in a way, but mostly because it's surprisingly mundane.  Peerce is Peerce, he does a great job, but there's nothing shocking or new.  If you have Toscanini, then you have Peerce (in much finer sound).\n\nLet us put to rest the very pleasant myth that everything that came from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera, during the Golden Age, was automatically a masterpiece.  This is without a doubt the scrappiest (note the politically-expedient leading 's' on my chosen adjective) Traviata ever to come from a leading house.  The conducting is uninspired, to put it charitably.  The tempos are mostly S-L-O-O-W-W, and it is simple time-beating.  Now when I say 'mostly' slow, that implies that some of it is not slow.  That is true.  The Dr. scene is the most hurried Dr. scene ever to grace wax.  This guy was REALLY late to a golf appointment, or perchance he had to go to the little boy's room.  Whatever it was, he had to get the heck outa there, FAST.\n\nAbout the Violetta, who I have never heard of (not that that means any one thing).  She is labeled as a soprano, but I swear has the alluring, well-rounded voice of a mezzo.  And fathom what else?  She doesn't do any top notes.  Have you ever heard a Violetta who avoided the top notes?  I'm not saying it's crummy, but certainly is unusual.  There is something else a little different.  She uses some different words.  In Fors'e lui, she doesn't sing \"Gioir! Gioir!\", she sings \"Aaaaaah! Aaaaah!\"  And there are other words she uses in certain areas, but I don't know what they are.  That is certainly different.\n\nAltogether it is an unsettling Violetta and I will have to say, if she could sing Violetta at the Met, so frankly could any of the talented ladies singing Violetta at community opera I know with no apologies whatsoever.\n\nLawrence Tibbett is father Germont, and I am sure you are aware he is one of the greatest baritones of the 20th century.  He is giving it everything he has, and it actually detracts.  Yes, I am afraid it is an odd mix to put him in this mediocre production.  It is like having a New York Steak with potato chips and diet orange soda on the side.\n\nThe score has been slice, of course.  The standard cuts are taken, and then some.  Even the parts of the two messengers ('La signora e partita', and 'Una dama d'un cocchio') are slice.  Alfredo just asks who's there, then proceeds to read the letter.  So you are telling me at the Metropolitan Opera they didn't have anyone who could take these 10-second messenger parts?\n\nNow about the sound.  The sound is very good for the age, up until the last act.  Of course, it is not as good as Toscanini of 1946, but then again, nothing of that era is.  It's certainly as good as, actually finer than, the live Callas Traviatas of 15 years later.  Then beginning the last act, there is an bothersome series of ticks or bumps that won't go away.  When it first starts, one might say it's not too crummy.  But it goes on the whole act, and it strains the limits of tolerability.\n\nSo the good stuff here is Peerce as Alfredo, which can be best enjoyed with Toscanini, and Tibbett as Germont, which is finer enjoyed with Ponselle.  The rest of it is altogether 'meh'.  Of course, it is cheap, but the question is, do you want to spend the time and sanity when there are SO MANY truly distinguished Traviatae out there??","3372":"what a misuse of time, just like them a$$ clowns in O-H-Lie-O\u20ac","3373":"The most recent triple CD set for IPO #14 (2011) has no track listing yet, so here's what's on them, in order.\n\n(group)-(song)(\"*\" asterisks indicate my suggested finer album tracks)\nCD 1: (76:49)\nThe Turnback-Beyond Belief,\nThe Kik-My Eyes Are Still Dry,\nThe Dahlmanns-I Adore You Baby (But I Loathe Your Friends)(*),\nThe Records (with John Wicks)-That Girl Is Emily(*),\nDavid Myhr-Loveblind(*),\nLongplayer-Silicone Sue,\nPopfilter!-Back To Zero,\nPaul Housden & The Futurists-Textbook,\nAll Day Sucker-Santa Ana (*),\nThe Real Numbers-Internet Famous,\nNushu-Precious To Me,\nSonny Lee & The Layover-What's It Gonna Be Now,\nThe Adore Dimension-Question Mark Heart,\nThe PondHawks-Weather Girl (*),\nBlake Jones & The Trike Shop-I Roped The Moon Out Of The Sky (unplugged)(*),\nThe Secrets-Living Without You (*),\nSusan Hedges-Hot Summer Lover,\nVan Go-Invisible Girls,\nCharge Of The Light Brigade-Young Adore,\nBrad Wait-Ride,\nA Band Called Mithras-Ruby,\nPlasticsoul-Beth,\n\nCD 2: (76:23)\nBastards Of Melody-Dream Jeannine,\nFortune 500-Shake Me,\nDee Long-I Can't Help It,\nSecret Powers-Tangerine (*),\nJeremy-Adore Explosion,\nCarousels-Call Along The Coast,\nSpygenius-The Girl Who's Everywhere,\nDirty Royals-Back For More (*)(and see IPO Vol 10 for \"Cover Up The Sun\", a super catchy song by them),\nLannie Flowers-Give Me A Chance,\nDave Rave-Your Sparks Fly,\nClockwise-Sugar Coat It,\nFireking-Built To Last,\nFox Pass-Hurry Cherie,\nPopdudes-Coming Up,\nHector Penalosa-It's Gonna Be Allright,\nThe American Professionals-Champion,\nShplang-Oh My Adore,\nWaiflike-Sober Now,\nThe Treeshakers-Babe You Did Me Down,\nT.C.

Thank you Margaret-Anne for your talent, wisdom and sweet voice!","3375":"The songs on THESE ARMS contain a number of influences - folk, country, blues, Cajun (reflecting Mark's heritage).  One of the fine things about this talented duo is how seamlessly they can blend these, sometimes within an individual song, into a viable whole that is simply great music that not only touches the soul of listeners, but deliver nourishment to their minds as well...not to mention inducing them to a good bit of foot-tapping in the process...and the urge to dance.\n\nSeven out of the eleven tunes on this album are Mark Viator originals, and they clearly illustrate what a fine writer he is.  He's also a very talented guitarist - almost all of the guitar work on the recording is Mark's.  Whether he's fingerpicking or flatpicking, or playing slide, it's always masterful and appropriate, and never showy for the sake of it - it's all about the music and what supports it best and conveys the mood.  When Mark shifts from accompanying lyrics to adding a spot of lead, the seamlessness is fine to behold.  If you're fortunate enough to see them perform live (which we do every chance we get), you'll understand this even more. The songs here that were written by others (Thad Beckman, Robert Earl Keen, Kate Wolf and Hank Williams) are as well-chosen as the originals are well-written, and suit Mark and Susan to a T.\n\nMark's Cajun heritage is never far from the surface.  `Queen of the bayou' is a heartfelt tribute to his grandmother, a tasty stew of recollections and adore.  `Ain't goin back' is an honest look at the life of a proud Louisiana working man, a vivid picture of resilience and devotion to family.  `Dharma bums', as one might gather from the title, was inspired by Jack Kerouac's novel, and wonders eloquently if the idealism the book inspired in many of us when we read it the first time can be carried and kept alive as our lives move along.  Susan's voice carries Mark's original `These arms' to sweet heights - it's a alluring adore song, extremely moving, and one you'll find yourself humming it before you realize it.  Her renditions of Kate Wolf songs (`Across the Great Divide' appears here), as well as those of country legends such as Hank Williams (`I'm so lonesome I could cry' gets a alluring reading on this album) and Patsy Cline (if you're lucky enough to see them perform, ask for `Walkin after midnight'), are all nothing short of fine, and Robert Earl Keen's `I would change my life' illustrates that she can give new life to more contemporary songs.  She makes everything she sings her own, reaching down into her artist's soul to color them with shades from her own palette.  When the two of them blend their voices, the harmonies are splendid and the chemistry is intimate - you can get a sense of it from just listening, but again, seeing them perform in a live setting makes it abundantly clear that they adore what they're doing.\n\nMany of Austin's finest musicians lend their talents to this recording.  It never feels over-crowded, rather like a conversation among good friends, where everyone has something to contribute but no one attempts to dominate.  Every track flows easily along, without production getting in the way of the material.  As I said earlier, this is simply great music - well-written, performed with heart and talent, and a entire joy to experience.  Pass it up at your peril.  I don't think I'm allowed to insert a link to their website here, but if you do a search for them, you'll find it - there are samples available there, and you'll hear what I mean.  If you like what you hear - and if you enjoy great music, I feel sure you will - check out Mark's earlier solo album BAYOU TCHE, filled with more finely-crafted original songs (one co-written by another great Austin-based songwriter, Slaid Cleaves), and his solo acoustic guitar offering WIRE & WOOD, showcasing his instrumental talents.  They're both distinguished.","3376":"I think the reviewers must either be friends of the artist or have never heard any other rap before...but this is just abhorrent.

At all.  I'm unhappy, but conserve yourself the cash and acquire something else.","3377":"Sangre's new album the Great Tribulation is seriously one of the Best Metal albums I've acquired in 2011. I like every song on here. The songs are really heavy and make you want to Headbang until your head falls off. Every song is great but if I had to pin Point my beloved they would be the first track \"Vengeance\" It's straight up Death Metal with some Black Metal elements added to it. The Vocalist growls mixed in with his High Pitch Black Metal Screams makes this song stand up to it's name. It's full of bloody Vengeance.\nThe Title track \"The Great Tribulation\" intro riff is sick! Another very Death Metal and Black Metal influenced track thrown in with some very Gutenberg Swedish Melo Death inspired riffing reminiscent of At The Gates mixed in with some Dissection.  Very Heavy but Melodic at the same time. Another stand out if I had to chose, and trust me it's hard to pick a song cause they are all brutal and awe-inspiring would be \"Forever I\" This song if I had to describe it would be Thrash Metal meets Tool. This song is really heavy and makes you want to thrash and get stoned! The vocalist mixes in his growls and screams with his melodic vocals. Not many Metal vocalist can pull this off but his voice is great. hahahaha. Sangre mixes their Thrash Metal\/Death\/Black Metal influences really well with the great Melody of Swedish melo death with a dash of progressive Metal. Seriously all 13 tracks make you want to headbang and circle pit. Also the Drumming is freaken distinguished. Great crazy Fills through out the songs. Reminds me of Danny Carey Meets Dave McClain of Machine Head on crack with great Blast Beats and Double Peddle Action! Oh and to top it off, The Bass is actually played the way it should be, playing along to the Drummer! I GIVE SANGRE'S THE GREAT TRIBULATION 10 OUT OF 1O! METAL AT IT'S FINEST. i WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO FANS OF TOOL, MACHINE HEAD, SLAYER, AT THE GATES, PANTERA. I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL HEAVY METAL FANS!

But whatever the case, some really great and memorable music came out from the mid-sixties to the early seventies. I recommend that anyone who grew up with Glen Campbell's music get this and any other from that time frame as it will evoke many sweet recollections.","3387":"I acquired this FLAC because I rather liked the tune, but couldn't find any other information on it anywhere else.  Regrettably, this isn't just the music, but contains the cheesy sound effects from the episode as well.  Rather disconcerted in that, would not have acquired it if the preview had included some of the sound effects.","3388":"Although Mozart's prolificacy was lifelong, 1784 was a special year for him. During this annus mirabilis, Mozart wrote no less than 6 piano concertos (all masterpieces, K.449 through K.459), the Quintet for Piano and Winds K.452 (in Mozart's own words, the greatest thing he had ever written), the great C Minor Piano Sonata (K.457) and the \"Hunt\" String Quartet in Bb (the fourth of the six \"Haydn\" Quartets). All of this in less than 12 months.\n\nDuring this remarkable year, the 9 weeks between 2\/9\/1784 and 4\/12\/1784 stand out, transcending mere fecundity:\n\nFebruary 9, 1784: Mozart completes the Eb Piano Concerto K.449\nMarch 15, 1784: Mozart completes the Bb Piano Concerto K.450\nMarch 22, 1784: Mozart completes the D Major Piano Concerto K.451\nMarch 30, 1784: Mozart completes the Quintet for Piano and Winds in Eb, K.452\nApril 12, 1784: Mozart completes the G Major Piano Concerto K.453\n\nThis is astonishing - some might even say miraculous - even for Mozart. In recent years many scholars and musicians - particularly of the HIP variety - have sought to demystify Mozart, to knock him down a peg or two. Musicologists have been keen to point out his flaws and seem obsessed with the prosaic details of his life and work, and HIP practitioners have endeavored to bring Mozart \"down to earth\" with roughed-up, sweaty, ugly sounding performances. The goal seems to be to endlessly remind us that Mozart a mere mortal. The Zeitgeist commands that we scoff at notions of divine inspiration. Mozart was nothing more, the musicologists tell us, than a very clever man.\n\nYet when we listen to the music we know finer. And in spite of their ongoing efforts to mortalize Mozart, no musicologist has been able to sufficiently address the miracle of 1784. How did Mozart do it? How could any man create no less than 5 masterpieces in less than 9 weeks? It is one of the great mysteries of the universe, and one that no scholar, no matter how learned, will ever be able to answer - just as physicists will never be able to explain the deepest questions of existence.\n\nThis recording is a hidden gem of the catalogue. It pairs Walter Klien - one of the keenest Mozarteans who ever lived - with Stanislaw Skrowaczewski (SS) and the Minnesota Orchestra. Klien's way with this music is wonderfully idiomatic. His instrument of choice was a Bosendorfer Imperial, which allows for fortepiano-like transparancy without the hideous sonorities associated with period instruments. Klien is a master of legato - each note sparkles, but his touch is percussive enough to make Mozart's keyboard lines both sing and dance.\n\nAs a \"B\" label, Vox employed some scruffy regional ensembles - some not much more than pickup bands - to record the Mozart Concertos with Klien (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Mozart-Entire-Solo-Piano-Concertos-The-Voxbox-Edition\/dp\/B009T2XPC0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mozart: Entire Solo Piano Concertos (The Voxbox Edition)<\/a>&nbsp;In the 60's and 70's he was paired with the Mainzer Kammerorchester with Gunter Kehr (K.414, K.456, K.467), the Pro Musica Orchester Wien & Paul Angerer (k. 449), the Wiener Volksoperorchester with Peter Maag (K.451, K.488, K.491, K.537). In each of these recordings (none of which have been remastered to date) Klien shines, but the B-grade orchestras sound sour and rough. Whether that is more a function of meager engineering than the artistic shortcomings of the ensembles, we cannot know. Either way, it is a shame - considering Klien's immense talent - that these recordings sound as rough and harsh as they do.\n\nThankfully, we at least have this disc, the only Mozart Concerto performances featuring Klien in which the orchestra and sound engineering rise to the occasion. In K.453, SS leads the Minnesotans in spirited readings of the outer movements, and the Andante is full of such exquisite beauty and refinement that it qualifies as a \"postcard from Cythera\" (as reviewer BO'H would say!). Klien's playing of the Andante cadenza is deeply contemplative - and on his Bosendorfer, we get to luxuriate in those deep bass notes. SS's crisply articulated Rondo is a joy - both Klien and the ensemble impart a sparkling vitality to the Presto interlude at 5:20. This Presto interlude is one of Mozart's best surprises, and a archetypal example of what makes Mozart Mozart. Overall, there is an abundance of energy in play here, and happily, a lot of it is supplied by the Minnesotans.\n\nK.595 has long been a subject of debate. Today's musicologists sneer at the notion that Mozart intended it as a farewell; accordingly, the HIP movement usually deprives their readings of this concerto of any sense of valediction. While the musicologists may be right, the HIP practitioners are surely wrong to play K.595 prosaically.\n\nWhether Mozart realized it or not, the Bb Concerto he completed on January 14, 1791 is indeed his farewell to the genre. Alfred Einstein argued passionately that Mozart seemed to have a premonition about his fate; while we may never know if this is really true, the music itself tells us that Einstein may have been right after all.\n\nRight from the start, the cellos and basses underline the Allegro with a sense of gravity. The happy tunes that follow are thus tinged with sadness - the sun is shining, but for the last time - and this signals that Klien and the Minnesotans see K.595 as more than just another item in the Koechel catologue, its status as the final piano concerto being something more than mere coincidence.\n\nAny doubt one might have about the valedictory nature of this work is removed in the Larghetto - a vision of eternity - and Klien and the Minnesotans play it with a wistfulness that makes the heart ache. The Rondo, playful and childlike - a longing for the days of innocence - is sweet, charming, innocent, and bitter. Arthur Hutchings wrote that \"the sun never sets on any of Mozart's four piano concertos in Bb\" - this is undoubtedly true, but in K.595, twilight is nigh.\n\nThis pairing is serendipitous. The sound is good, and the performances are brilliant. Marvel at the miracle of 1784. For 62 enchanted days, time let Mozart \"hail and climb \/ Golden in the heydays of his eyes...\"\n\n\"... And honoured among wagons I was prince of the apple towns\nAnd once below a time I lordly had the trees and leaves\nTrail with daisies and barley\nDown the rivers of the windfall light.\"\n\n-D.

I doubt it.\nMeager quality run.\nConserve your cash.","3390":"This is an album of magnum opus Muppet songs covered by modern artists.  It includes beloved like \"Rainbow Connection\" and \"Movin' Right Along\" from THE MUPPET MOVIE (1979), but my cherished track, hands-down, is Matt Nathanson's \"I Hope That Something Finer Comes Along\".\n\nOther highlights include \"I'm Going To Go Back There Someday\" by Rachael Yamagata, \"Bein' Green\" by Andrew Bird, \"Our World\" by My Morning Jacket, and Sondre Lerche's lively \"Mr. Bassman\".\n\nFINE Go perform the \"Muppet Show Theme\" in their off-kilter style.  Weezer and Paramore's Hayley Williams put an alternative\/punk spin on the uplifting \"Rainbow Connection\".  \"Mahna Mahna\" is pretty much a straight cover of the Muppet original, with very little interpretation by The Fray.\n\nThe more I listen to this album, the more I warm up to it.  I adore the Muppets and am familiar with most of these songs.  Most of the covers stay true to the original Muppet versions and make for enjoyable listening (though I found \"Night Life\" by Brandon Saller of Atreyu and Billy Martin of Good Charlotte to be too heavy for this collection).  This tribute album hits its highs with the various ballads, in my opinion.  The final three tracks are an distinguished block of music to close out the album.\n\n\"I Hope That Something Finer Comes Along\" was a comical lovesick ditty sung in THE MUPPET MOVIE by Kermit and Rowlf.  Nathanson sings it softly with piano accompaniment.  It's such a alluring tune, you forget he's singing about dogs and frogs.\n\nI think any Muppet enthusiast should give this tribute album a try.  At least listen to the FLAC samples.  There are some fan-cherished songs and some interesting interpretations.  And the interesting mix of contemporary artists might allow listeners to get acquainted with acts they hadn't really heard before.","3391":"My man Dom Pachino is maad nice, and son's skills have only increased since Killarmy's first joint 'Silent Weapons'. (If you hear Dom on 'Silent Weapons' and listen to him on later albums and projects, you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.) I've also been really impressed by Pachino's newer solo joints (go and copp that 'Unreleased' joint) on his Napalm Recordings imprint, which is nice because now fans get to hear Pachino spit 100% rather than passing the mic to his compadres. Hands down, Dom Pachino is one of my cherished emcees, PERIOD.\n\nNontheless, I heard this and was heavily disconcerted and let down. If you listen to all of his solo projects since the last Killarmy album, PR sounds like he's pumped full of vigorous energy, spittin venomous darts all around the tracks. This one '4 Security Reasons' sounds lazy, tired, mundane, lethargic, monotonous, uninspired, and overall a below average performance from the PRT.\n\nWhoever was enlisted for production provided some really tired samples that were sloppily chopped up. On top of that, the beats are all under about 120 bpm except for a fast song (track 3, \"Gunz Out\")with some sloppy drum programming. Even Dom's darts are terribly mundane as are those from the lesser known Wu-affiliates (like Crunch Lo from Cappadonn'a group Othorized F.A.M.), which is one reason why so much of the extended Wu fam is unknown: most of them aren't worth listening to. I hope this 'Security' project is not a downward spiral into the descent of wackness for Dom. Only time will tell.\n\nBut if you want some hot Dom ish, check out 'Unreleased', 'Domination' (which is really hard to find), or almost any one thing under his Napalm recording label.","3392":"Pear  Extemp'ore PSCD 2011\nRELEASE DATE 5\/24\/2011\n\nRick Milne - Percussion\n\nNick Pierone - Keyboards\n\nEvery fiber of my being tells me that I should really loathe this release...I rarely listen to others so why should I pay much attention to myself. I would be wrong.\n\nPushing musical boundaries all while innovative, evocative and with an unreal sonic depth of field. The debut from Pear opens the musical senses but asks you to do but one thing.\n\nListen.\n\nThe amount of time, pondered and creative energy put into this release must be mind boggling. A musical frame of reference would be later more experimental Miles Davis meets Brian Eno. Welcome to the land of rhythm and groove.\n\nImprovisation. Being in the musical moment is the celebration that is \"Extempore.\" One special guest that gives a phenomenal performance is bassist Jennifer Leitham. This is truly a release that will give up something new of itself with each spin of the disc. \"Subtle nuances\" prevail whether the Miles Davis sampled spoken word intro to \"Dewey Miles\" or the rapper Cindy Fine this may be the finest example of a free jazz recording session to date.\n\nCreativity abounds, avant garde but accessible; a sonic color pallet for the mind","3393":"It was not what I really wanted. I wanted the original music and peole singing the music. This was just the music that was put together for people who just wanted to hear the music and that was not me. If possible I would like to exchange it fo the one that has the original music and words.  If that is not possible I understand.  Thank You.  Susan Neice","3394":"If wishes were horses, beggars would ride. This song made me want to break my iPod. I feel crummy for her kids who had to listen to her 'sing' this over and over again. It's heavily synthesized and the only bearable thing is the beat. My husband is an audio engineer, and he was so shocked when he heard this song. The vocals are very amateur and the singer has no range or depth. Calls for singing lessons for like 5 years before she should release another song. Don't acquire this tripe, conserve your cash for some real music. Even if you are a die-hard Gorga fan, stop the madness! At least with Tardy for the Party it was a catchy tune. This is just total junk. I wouldn't listen to this again even if you paid me to do so!","3395":"I may be over a year late with this criticism, but I presume someone calls for to share just how distinguished this album is--especially for psych-rock aficionados--so finer late than never. While Tim Cohen's other band, The Fresh & Onlys, are a little more well-known, I presume his work under the name Magic Trick is more timeless. Whereas the former specialize in up-tempo, 60s-ish (now 80s-ish) jangle psych, and to great effect, Magic Trick's music here is truly original, and almost defies categorization.\n\n'The Glad Birth of Adore' contains elements of folk, old-school blues, Indian music, Syd Barrett-style psych, and prog, resulting in a sound that not only is unique, but when combined with the surrealistic, soul-stirring lyrics and heartfelt vocals, is very moving as well, and makes for an extremely absorbing listening experience. The four songs here average over 10 minutes apiece, making this album splendid for late-night headphone journeys. Throughout, you'll hear reverb-soaked acoustic finger-picking, gorgeous boy-girl harmonies, hypnotic drones, and stellar dream-like melodies, with a hazy atmospheric sheen over everything that gives these songs an eerie, mystical sound that seems way off in the distance while tickling your brain at the same time.\n\nIf you're a fan of The Fresh & Onlys, do yourself a favor and give this a shot, even though it is entirely different. But there's no denying just-plain great-songwriting. The closest comparison I could make would be the rootsy post-rock of early 2000's Califone mixed with the dreamy folk-pop of Skygreen Leopards, but weirder and more progressive. It'd probably be easiest, though, to just check out the free stream at Bandcamp and decide for yourself. If you're any one thing like me, it most likely won't be coming out of your rotation for a very long time.","3396":"The truth is that the criticism is of one star is a star too many. Arduous to rebrand cow dung by calling it cow patties just is an attempt to hide the truth. It is still cow dung. That is how I feel about this song, artist, and the whole wannabe album. This song is abhorrent, the beat is okay, but the vocals are ghastly. There is no depth or range. It's a misuse of time and cash both on the consumers' end and on the part of everyone subjected to this. The only happy person is probably the audio engineer  that mixed this because he is laughing all the way to the bank for the hours he has logged in the studio arduous to make this tripe radio worthy. The truth...is that this totally stinks.","3397":"I would not misuse the 89 cents for this song.  It is over processed electronically and abhorrent.  What company would want to bankroll this.  This is worse than Countess Luann's song.","3398":"It must be a joke on the music buying public to actually charge for this so-called music.  This chick couldn't sing her way out of a kid's birthday party.  Nothing but over-processed, heavily synthesized, trite, electronica junk.  While the cream still rises to the top with modern home recording technology, the downside is that we have to wade through a sea of human misuse to get to it.  Melissa Gorga is a no talent hack who calls for her troll of a husband's cash to bankroll this mess because NO ONE ELSE WILL.  Ridiculous.","3399":"Ugh. If half star was an option, that is what this deserves. It's not catchy, it's asinine...kinda like audio cyanide. Not being a hater, but this song is abhorrent. The person that gave it 5 stars must be deaf. Stone deaf. No talent whatsoever. No range, can't hold a note for more than a second. No lung capacity. No depth. Very choppy, which means she couldn't sing the whole thing all the way through. Every single song on this album is abhorrent. The songwriter that wrote this probably wishes they had never given Gorga this song to sing. They probably wish they had given it to anyone else...perchance even her cousin. If anyone else had sung it, this song would have had more traction and be 10x finer. This is terribly sung, and i want a refund. she probably sounds great in the shower...but don't we all? That doesn't mean you need to be \"On Display\"","3400":"Im giving this a four because i haven't heard the whole album. But these are the songs i loved - definately worth hearing:\n\n1. Perchance = This is a alluring song. Its a adore song for this generation about a guy who likes this girl and he isn't sure if she feels the same and he sits around waiting for her to text him\/sign on etc. Its reaaally sweet, the music is alluring, the words aren't typical what you hear in adore songs and jay sean sounds the best hes ever appeared. Its got a little guitar solo that everyone will adore towards the end\n\n2. Stay = The lyrics in this song and the chorus are First-rate. I adore how he drags on the word \"stay\" in the chorus. Its about a guy and his girl who always argue and basically he says he knows he treats her crummy but he wants her to stay. The remix of this is hot as well.\n\n3. Tonight = This song kinda reminds me of Neyo \"Closer\" but its also its own thing. Jay sings about a girl who catches his eye at the club and hes saying he aint lettin her go home tonight.. its a hot track\n\n4. Ride it = I didn't like this song at first but it grows on you.. listen to it a few times its a pretty nice song.\n\nThats all ive heard but i think it would be worth getting the album. Jay sean has talent we've seen that from his last album. Check out the songs ive listed, im sure you'll adore it.\n\nMurder is an awe-inspiring song as well. It features a girl name Thara who sings it well with Jay. And Used to Adore her is pretty good too.","3401":"The Way of Peace is a New Pondered book written by James Allen. Although Allen is more widely known for his As a Man Thinketh, it is the lesser known The Way of Peace (1907) which reflects more accurately his New Pondered Movement affiliations, referencing as it does Christianity, Buddhism and Hinduism. The book is essentially a treatise on the importance of meditation as a 'pathway to divinity'. Whatever we meditate upon, Allen explains, we become. If you meditate upon ' that which is selfish and debasing, you will ultimately become selfish and debased'. Whereas if you meditate upon ' that which is pure and unselfish you will surely become pure and unselfish'. It is now in the public domain within the United States and most other countries. It has been released as a Project Gutenberg eText edition. The book consists of 7 chapters: The Power Of Meditation; The Two Masters, Self And Truth; The Acquirement of Spiritual Power; The Realisation of Selfless Adore; Entering into the Infinite; Saints, Sages, And Saviors, The Law Of Service; and The Realisation of Splendid Peace. The first chapter also contains a poem, Star of Wisdom, which captures the essence of the book.","3402":"More like Tom Petty meets your typical flavor of the day post 90s poppy commercial rock. Looking at the guys on the cover you would swear they just got done playing a biker bar, but the tunes are radio aimed all the way. There are a few decent riffs here and there for certain, but the dilemma is that they all fall flat on their face as they just plain try too hard to be catchy. You gotta groove hard and strong IMO and these tunes just DON'T. The bitter thing here is that the vocals and guitar are of an obvious very high caliber. One of two things transpired with American Bang. Either (a), they were led around by a nose ring via a lame producer that was over concerned with \"hooks\", or (b)as a group they put all their eggs in the commercial radio basket. Either way, it's weak and typical commercial rock. BTW, what the heck are people comparing this to magnum opus Stones or Skynyrd for??? There is NOTHING here even remotely close. That much is hype to be sure.","3403":"'Wow' is all I can say about some of this astonishing artist's songs! Very original, artistic, and written so well. The lyrics are great, the music is astonishing, and his voice is the best I've ever heard. This song, Cherished Disease, is one of my beloved of the more tame songs from TFK. A must-have for every TFK fan, if you ask me!","3404":"This song is very unique, and everyone may not like this type of song...I don't know. I do; especially given that fact that Thousand Foot Krutch made and sings it.\n\nIt is about drug addicts, I do presume. The singer is saying that \"every time I hear you say I just need one, to take this pain away\/\nyou're a broken wing, not a broken thing, you can heal in time, if you try, it'll be okay, you can walk away, sweet Juliana...\" and that he wishes he can take the pain away, to make it all seem safe.\n\nIn the bridge, he says: \"and I won't laugh, I won't look, I won't listen if you just get up\/ and I won't laugh, I won't\nlook, I won't listen if you just stand...\" and I like that, because that is exactly what people who need to stop something (from a crummy habit to drugs or whatever) need to hear, that somebody cares and won't laugh at them arduous, won't laugh if they fail again.\n\nWhich can be used as either God saying that, or a loved one, either works, I think. Or if the person listening to the song has no one, then it's the singer telling them.\n\nIt's really a alluring song. I recommend it 110%.","3405":"I acquired this CD for relaxation in my home spa. It started skipping by the second song and skipped the entire CD.

Finer than I imagined.","3407":"\"Your Last Smile\" is the debut album from Iranian composer\/pianist Behdad Bahrami, and what an unreal debut it is! The twelve original piano solos are tinged with melancholy and blend classical, new age, and pop elements into a soulful, meaningful listening experience that gives a glimpse into the soul of a very passionate and poetic young man. It is also a reminder of what a forceful and universal language music is and that although we might not understand each other's words, speaking from the heart with music will always be understood.\n\n\"Your Last Smile\" begins with \"The Light On the Balcony,\" a piece that conveys warm contentment with an accessible grace and gentle touch. \"Secret Whispers\" is gorgeous. A bit more classical in style, the haunting and slowly flowing melody creates a pensive, dreamy mood. \"Voice of the Rain\" is one of my beloved. It occurs to me that if Chopin were alive today, he might compose something like this. I also really adore \"Cold Steps,\" a dark, very introspective piece that comes from deep within, expressing a profound sadness that takes your breath away. \"Melody of Autumn\" is much lighter and has a  swirling energy. \"Nobody Knows\" is a lovely ballad that seems to be telling a story - perchance a shared secret. \"The Last Smile of You\" conveys the feeling of tragic loss. Mournfully bitter yet elegant and graceful, this is another cherished. \"The Cafe at 25 O'Clock\" is quite different from the other tracks, with jazz chords and playful keyboard runs that show another side of this gifted artist. \"End of a Dream\" ends the album with a light-hearted waltz that dances around the piano with its charming melody and then ends abruptly at just the right moment.\n\nBehdad Bahrami is a really impressive new artist who just might be on the brink of an international music career. Supremely recommended!","3408":"As a longtime Tub Ring fan, it pains me to give them a crummy criticism, but the only thing that kept me from giving this a 1 star is my adore of the band and the 4 songs that I think are listenable on it: #03 Cg Vs.

But he didn't think he could make a living as a musician so, after university, he took a job with an ad agency in the northern city of San Pedro Sula, Corts.\n\nThere, Polache was chosen to compose the music for an ad campaign promoting Honduras and the result, \"Mira a Honduras\" or \"Look at Honduras,\" became a surprise hit. In the song, Polache points out that besides political corruption, gang wars and poverty, Honduras is home to great natural beauty and honest, hardworking people.\n\n\"This is a country with low self-esteem,\" Polache said. \"I wanted to write a song that said: Even if we have thousands of problems, we have many good things that need to be recognized.\"\n\nThe success of \"Mira a Honduras\" led to a television program in which Polache traveled the backroads, strumming his guitar and singing with the locals -- like an old-fashioned troubadour.\n\n[...]\n\nPolache grew up listening to U.S. and British pop music. But he later came to presume that too many Honduran tastes -- from fast food to popular music -- were imported. \"My music tries to promote all that's catracho,\" he said, using a slang term for Honduran.\n\nFor many years he chased that dream playing with one of the nation's biggest teams : Motagua. Failing to obtain success he called it a day and decided to start a career in the advertisement industry. He created numerous jingles for commercial products. His breakthrough as an artist came while working on a Honduran Tourism campaign, which needed a song to go along with the advertisement. Polache submitted \"Mira a Honduras\". The song was selected.  At first his name was not mentioned, but people got interested and started asking questions about the unidentified artist. From then on his career flourished.  Polache went on to have his own tv show \"De Troba con Polache\", in which he visited various places in Honduras.\n\nAt some point Polache got financial help from an artist support program created by the couped president Manuel Zelaya. When the coup transpired in June 2009, Polache was one of the few Honduran artists to strongly oppose. He called himself apolitical but said he was a friend of president Zelaya.\n\nPolache's music has been a great success thanks to the things he sings about : from everyday social problems to one of Honduras' main passions : football. He tends to write his songs in a very special way, using as much Honduran words and expressions as possible.","3411":"Oh my GOD!! I adore guided imagery mediation and hypnosis tapes.

Rum times indeed.\n\nThe irony is that \"Wyvern & Worm\" is doing its best to preserve many of the sounds of `60s, it's gentle psychedelic jangle will remind many of groups such as The Zombies and Traffic, right through to the more traditionalist recordings of XTC and Robyn Hitchcock. Fortunately, Flowers songs are ageless, impossible to truly pin down, and rather than wallow in clich, he writes songs that timelessly evoke an England, which hasn't altogether disappeared, but is certainly becoming harder to find. He then envelops them in soaring harmony and splendid pop arrangements.\n\n\"Wyvern & Worm\" won't bring Flowers international stardom and untold wealth, but it does mark the arrival of an artist eager to come to terms with new surroundings, new traditions and enduring music. The best material here happily stands alongside the magnum opus recordings that have obviously influenced him. \"Pastoral First-rate\" takes on early, baggy Blur and wins with a paisley flourish. \"Bitter Light\" deliver his antipodean roots to bear, and the Finn brothers are filtered through hazy sunshine psychedelia. \"Dawn Chorus\" greets the new day with Northern brass and a cheery disposition, and best of all, \"White Horse\", six minutes of mellow, intense narrative, accompanied by graceful strum and the impression of old Albion restored.","3417":"It goes without saying that Fanny were the premier female rock group of their time and I'd argue that their concise instrumental prowess and fresh intelligent songwriting put them a notch ahead of the average group of either gender. Why their rich musical legacy has been criminally unrecognised is incomprehensible to me but that might change if June and Jean Millington's 'Play like a Girl' gets heard as it harks back to Fanny at their best and shows where they are right now.\n\nThe title track is guarenteed to get the dead rise out of their graves and dance as it is played at an infectious energy level and is June Millington's opening feminist exhortation that you can do what you damn well want. I adore Your Hair sharply references back to a preceding era as a sixties woman in both senses of the term with lightning fast sharp observations. Jean's fine vocals and funk bass playing comes to the fore in let Adore Linger with acid guitar lines. The softer side of the Millington sisters show up in  June's tender adore song \"When You Bottom\" and the melodic \"Calling Your Name (To The Stars) I must pay tribute to Jean's son, Lee Madeloni as his fine drumming and percussion lends an incisive edge to the ensemble sound that is always there when needed. Jean's bass playing and singing makes a rock solid support as she always has done. The very worthy women musicians of the Institute of the Musical Arts get an airing in this project in \"One for Change,\" a great stomping rocker with gritty harmonisied chorus vocals and the contrasting modern R and B lead vocal stylings of Endless Lies, a syncopated rocker with lyrics that go way beyond what might appear an exhortation to a faithless lover to straighten up. June's prowess as electric slide guitar from way back of Ghastly Things reaches further into the awe-inspiring 'Train's a coming' Son House country blues of 'Fall on You' with contrasting light dancing vocals.\n\nThis is the album where youthful enthusiasm and age and experience hold hands and this feels so like a criticism of Fanny's \"Fanny Hill\" album it is unbelievable and I urge those best able to see them in concert.","3418":"To say that June and Jean Millington are a vital, albeit grossly overlooked, part of rock & roll history is a major understatement. As the co-founders of Fanny, the pioneering (and still, to this day, best!) all-female band, they, along with Suzi Quatro, set the stage for every other female rocker to come along over the next four decades.\n Over the years the duo have continued to work together, be it on June's three solo albums, as a duo (1978's LADIES ON THE STAGE and TICKET TO FINE from 1993) and with a new band, the Slammin' Babes (2000's MELTING POT).\n Now, more than a decade after the rather hit-and-miss MELTING POT, the sisters Millington return with PLAY LIKE A GIRL, arguably their best album since MOTHERS PRIDE, June's 1973 swan song with Fanny. While the disc isn't splendid (the production is a tad thin in spots, Jean Milington is woefully underused, students at June's Institute for the Musical Arts are used too much), it's pretty darn close. THIS is the album that many Fanny-atics have been waiting for!\n (On a side note, it's so cool to see so many women in their 60's still rockin' hard. Besides the Millington's, Quatro, Stevie Nicks and Deborah Harry ~ with Blondie~ have all released incredably strong albums this year, certainly among some of 2011's best).\n PLAY LIKE A GIRL kicks off with it's blistering title track. Full of garage-band energy and youthful swagger, this auto biographical tale is like \"Charity Ball\" all grown up! The sisters still have those killer harmonies that only siblings seem to be blessed with, while the instrumentation is taut and lively.\n In a just world, this would be a gargantuan radio hit, but there are a couple of things that will prevent that from happening. First, there are the lyrics...songs about fishes surfing up stream just aren't in demand. Then there's the production ~ there are holes here that you could drive a semi through. By going for more of a live feel, June Millington and co-producer Lee Madeloni (Jean's exceptionally talented son) have kept things pretty bare-boned. By adding some keyboards, a little more percussion and some additional backing vocals, the track would have been much more fleshed out, resulting in a great slice vs. just a very good one. Still, one of my cherished tracks off the disc!\n Ditto \"I Adore Your Hair!\" June Millington has rarely sung with such authority, attitude or animalistic passion. Growling the lyrics, she lets us know that she's been here since \"before the Gap\/before Madonna\/before rap\", and in that time, she's picked up a thing or two, resulting in a person she's happy with, both inside and out. Mark my word, this one IS ready to be a hit at urban, pop and A\/C radio. Brilliant! (Special mention has to be made of Jean's astonishing bass riffs...they anchor the song perfectly!).\n \"Let Adore Linger\" has both it's pros and cons. On the up side, it features Jean's only (co) lead vocal. Still supple and sultry, her voice dances over the first verse's lyrics, caressing them in a velvety embrace. Why this woman doesn't take more leads ~ or do a solo album, for God's sake! ~ is beyond me!\n On the down side, the song just goes on waaaay too long. Since moving beyond Fanny, the Millington's have frequently had a tendency to get a bit 'jammy', resulting in tracks that could have ~ and should have! ~ been edited down. This is one such track. Still,very nice.\n \"When You Bottom\" is sheer pop perfection. With it's lilting arrangement, spirited lead vocal courtesy of June and the girl group backing vocals, this track is plain old lively, from start to finish.\n \"Apocalypse Deferred\" has a dark, prophetic quality to it that really works....I just wish that they had taken it further. The arrangement is urgent and edgy, while June's lead vocal is honest and knowing, but the young girl chorus just seems calculated and contrived. I would have much rather seen something chilly, strong and steely from Jean, along the lines of her bridge on \"Woman Who Sees The Signs\" from June's distinguished 1983 solo album RUNNING.\n Throughout her career, June Millington has written some astonishing ballads, including \"You've Got A Home\" from Fanny's 1972 masterpiece FANNY HILL and LADIES ON THE STAGE's \"Fantasy.\" We can now add \"Calling Your Name (To The Stars)\" to that list. With it's atmospheric arrangement, delicate instrumentation and lovely lead vocal, this song is simply stunning. Nothing more need be said.\n \"Ghastly Things\" has a fine bluesy vibe to it. Both tense AND relaxed, taut AND loose, June's guitar just talks to us here, even moreso than her lyrics. Yet another gem.\n \"Fall On You\" is a solid album slice, with a minimal, yet strong, arangement (once again, June's guitar just shines!) and a wise, soulful lead vocal.\n \"All For One\" is sweet enough, but we've heard June do a variant of this song on pretty much every album since '78. Nice....but necessary? I'm not sure.\n \"One For Change\" could have been a great rocker, but it's ultimately sunk by a number of miscalculations. First off, we once again have the production...this sounds like a demo tape. Second, the chorus...really amateurish and sloppy. Finally, the track just goes on WAY too long, repeating itself over and over. Yep, the seeds were there....they just never took root.\n And then there's \"Endless Lies'...I have a real issue with this slice. I'm all for June's work with IMA, but there's a time and a place for it, and it's not here. . I'm paying for a June and Jean Millington album, not a class project for Summer camp 2010. I WANT June and Jean Millington, especially when Jean Millington is already almost nowhere to be found (If we're being really honest here, why even call this a June and Jean Millington album? To cash in even more on the Fanny connection? Let's face it...this is basically a June Millington solo album). On top of all that, the lyrics are just dreadful...straight out of Intro to Poetry 101, or, even worse, some tweener's journal. A MAJOR misstep.\n Wrapping things up is the funky \"Opportunity Knocks.\" I wish June had taken the time to build on this gem with another verse or a bridge ~ this is another good song that could have been First-rate.\n In summing things up, I just want to say how much I adore both June and Jean Millington (and have for 40 years now!) and PLAY LIKE A GIRL, warts and all. Both the sisters and this album are vitally important to music, and I, for one, can't wait to see what comes next! I just hope A) it doesn't take another ten years, and B) Jean can be convinced to pick up a pen and step up to the mike a bit more! Until then...play on, ladies....play on! (As with all my criticisms, I'm docking the disc half a star for not including the lyrics).","3419":"GAH! UUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK! BLEEEECCCCCH!!!\n\nNot good, not good, not good!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nRap is so harrowing in the first place, but to subject children to it through learning is atrocious!

When you have children that grow up listening to junk music & television (ie: Nicki Minaj, \"Family Guy\" & the like), it programs their brains (television PROGRAMS) & creates chaos & confusion.\nI don't think adults should listen to or watch that raunchy filth in the first place, but hey... the entertainment business banks on feeble minded people who wish to mindlessly numb themselves rather than enrich their lives.\n THEN people wonder why their child is a heathen, does poorly in school due to anger & frustration (frequencies), dresses like a thug or a street walker & won't listen to them. Temper tantrums are just uncontrolled & unguided bouts of anger. Most people anymore don't enjoy to correct (PARENT), but temporarily mask it with a \"reward\", like junk food, electronics or letting them run wild because they don't want to deal with them. I call it Wal-Mart Kid Syndrome. That child then grows up to be a hedonistic, uneducated jerk of an adult with an undeserving air of entitlement & narcissism because it was never corrected.\n\nIn test after test of academic abilities, American students score last in comparison with students from the other twenty or so advanced countries.

This calls for a crystal clear and strong voice, breathy just doesn't get it.  Also, unless you can nail it, don't try to do fancy runs.  There is something alluring about pure melody and pure harmony.  It's why I choose acapella music, after all.  It's just bitter as this was one of the reasons I acquired this album.  Oh well - there are other songs that work well.","3421":"Not too long since the release of Fantasynth and it's slightly more upbeat rhythms and fantasy themes, we're now treated with this work which delves into the more mysterious and legends based on celtic mythology, a theme very prevalent in gothic ethereal realms. It seems we're able to pick up where we left off with Mythomusic or The Garden with the dreamy mystical sounds on this album. The delicate layers of ambient music are presented across well over an hour in this fantasy world and eleven tracks for a nice full body of work.\n\nThe album starts off with a rich and dreamy mixture of ambient textures in \"Forest Heartbeat\" and also with the follow-up piece \"True Spirit of Nature\" for over fourteen minutes of alluring, lush dreamscapes. At this point we're launched into a little more up-beat chill-out style with \"Samhain Ecstasy\" and even more of a harsher tone with some grinding guitars (still in a new age style) on \"Sancta Inquisitio\". This uptempo rhythm carries on somewhat further into \"Druids Trance\", appropriately named for it's trance-like rhythms and electronic loops. At this point we get to a definite cherished of mine in \"My Beloved Loneliness\", with a little more of a classical style with more organic sounding instruments taking the forefront over the interwoven tapestries of the melancholy backdrop. \"Ritual of Adore\" follows in similar light with a little bit more of a ritual sound as the name implies with some percussion and various hypnotic rhythms and loops. \"Earth Prayer\" is another distinguished ambient ethereal piece with angelic vocals gliding over the entrancing music as we drift along into the upbeat trance-like piece \"Beltane Moon\". The soaring synths and moving, but very New Age rhythms and beats move us into another sweet, dreamy track \"Bewitched by the Faeries\". This eight minute track drifts along slowly and hypnotically, setting the stage for eight-minute finale \"Wisdom of Trees\". Ambient, whispering tendrils gently carress the listener in this soft, dreamy piece with it's subtle, layered soundscapes providing a backdrop for a siren song, luring the listener in and holding them entranced and trapped for the duration as the album slowly and softly drifts to a close.\n\nOver all the album is firmly rooted in the New Age style, something I've mentioned before we don't normally feature and criticism here on Gothic Paradise. Nontheless, there is just enough of the lush, ethereal and darker, dreamier ambient styles that take the listener into a alluring dream-like fantasyland that has always caught my attention. As you listen to our ethereal radio show and a Psicodreamics track comes on, it just fits well within the hauntingly alluring ambient realm, even with the touch of chill-out New Age styles. This album fits right in that mold as we drift from one piece to another, through the ebbing and flowing of the lush layers from smooth ambient synths to a little more pronounced styles and more upbeat rhythms. For fans of the softer ethereal and ambient soundscapes, this album is a great addition to any collection.\n\nRating: 4.5\/5\n\nGothic Paradise - [...]","3422":"NOT that inspiring.  the affirmations are weak\n\nIf you like the DVD \" The Secret,\" and Esther Hicks , \"Ask and it is Given\" (WHICH IS ABOUT ATTRACTING ABUNDANCE) ....You will find this FLAC a GARGANTUAN FAILURE.\n\nA MUCH FINER FLAC ABOUT ATTRACTING ABUNDANCE IS:\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Wealth-Abundance-Hypnosis\/dp\/B004VQAQHG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wealth & Abundance Hypnosis<\/a>\nby Leslie Riopel, \"Wealth & Abundance Hypnosis\"\n\nThis is More About Attracting Abundance.","3423":"This album is wow for my taste.

And also donating proceeds to the relief process.\n\nLike other recent AKB48 CD singles, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" has been released in 5 versions.  A regular and limited Type A, Type B editions (limited editions come with an event ticket) and the theater edition (which includes the first two tracks that come with the other two TYPE's, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" and \"Kimi no Senaka\" but comes with second C\/w song by Team 4 and KISS titled \"Tsubomitachi\" and no DVD).  Also, Type A and Type B will have different c\/w songs.\n\nAnd once again, in a time where CD sales are lower than ever in Japan, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" became the fifth million selling CD single for the group and going to show that AKB48s popularity is the real deal!\n\nThe version I will be reviewing is the regular edition Type-B featuring Mayu Watanabe, Yuki Kashiwagi and Minama Takahashi on the cover and the songs featured in the Type-B edition are \"Kaze wa Futeiru\", \"Kimi no Senaka\", \"Gondola Lift\".  The limited edition Type B comes with a random photo (there are a total of 18 available) and comes with a serial number to access a site for voting a song to be performed at AKB48s Request Hour Setlist Best 100 2012 concert and a promotional for their 2012 box calendar.\n\nAs for the CD single, \"Kaze wa Futeiru\" is a positive song of how people in despair, should have hope, should search for the light. Also, a song about rebuilding for the future and for one to continue living. How adore and hope will continue and that the wind will continue to blow into the future.\n\nMy first time listening to the song and I was instantly hooked.  The melody was captivating and I loved the harmony among the various members performing the song.  But the positive message of hope is what I enjoyed most about this song.\n\nThe second song \"Kimi no Senaka\" (which translates to \"Back to you\") is performed by the Undergirls (these are the members of the group who were ranked #22-#30 in the AKB48 senbatsu elections, who get to perform the c\/w song).  The song is upbeat and continues the AKB48 happy, upbeat idol style.  While the song is catchy and a lively song to listen to, the lyrics are actually quite bitter as it revolves around loving someone but that person not noticing you.  And one yearning to be noticed.\n\nThe third track is \"Gondola Lift\" and is performed by Undergirls Yurigumi.  For this single, the Undergirls was split into three groups with Baragumi performing \"Vamos\", while Yurigumi performed \"Gondola Lift\".  The slow ballad is about being a couple, in adore and being together with hearts as one and growing old together and also dying together.  A touching song!\n\nThe three tracks that round out the single are the off-vocal versions of each song, which are pretty much the music no vocal tracks.\n\nAs for the DVD, the DVD comes with a total of four tracks.\n\nThe first music video is for \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" as AKB48 tries to revive this tree-like being by freeing it from its captivity.  Also, a dance portion featuring the group dancing.  In terms of the music video, for set design, this is probably an interesting video as it has this tribalistic style to it, with the tree-being almost reminding me a of Studio Ghibli character.  As for costume design, the costumes are quite subdued compared to other AKB48 costume design but I liked the choreography on a dirt like setting and seeing the dirt flow while the group is dancing.  Overall, a good video.\n\nThe second music video is for \"Kimi no Senaka\" and has more dialogue and features friends who get into a discussion about a guy they like, while another friend is moving away.  Like the lyrics to the song itself, it's happy and upbeat but also a hint of sadness as well.\n\nThe third music video is for \"Gondola Lift\" and this video is actually my cherished video on the entire DVD.  Not only is the song alluring and touching, the music video shows what is behind the windows of an apartment building and we see an elderly man taking enjoy of his sick wife, a family eating dinner and a young couple with a young woman who wants to marry her boyfriend.\n\nThe fourth music video is the \"DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! version of \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\", so no mystical creature is featured.  It's all dancing!\n\nAnd the final fifth music video is the \"Tokuten eizo AKB48 conte Taxi-hen\" featuring a comedy skit with Mariko Shinoda as a taxi driver and Yuki Kashiwagi as a passenger.  The skit revolves around a taxi driver who talks too much.\n\nOverall, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" is a fine and enjoyable CD single from AKB48.  While there are the different versions available for fans who may prefer certain singles showcasing their cherished performer, I personally chose this CD+DVD single because of its inspirational songs.  \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" is an inspirational song but \"Gondola Lift\" was a First-rate and touching Undergirls track with a music video that was just equally enjoyable.\n\nBut all tracks on this CD single showcase a nice balance of music from AKB48 as well as its DVD.\n\nOnce again, I'm pretty impressed with what Yasushi Akimoto has done with AKB48 and how hard these young ladies have come since 2005.  This is another addictive CD single and if you are an AKB48 fan, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru (Type-B)\" is supremely recommended!","3425":"The first criticism above sounds like the composer giving himself a 5-star criticism.\n\nIn reality, it's ghastly, just plain ghastly.

The first two Sabbat albums on vinyl are good.

Gruberova's \"Czardas\" is distinguished, but overall she is shrill and seems always a little under pitch. The German is weirdly \"chewed,\" which makes many of the musical lines feel spat-out and disconnected ... granted, German is a tricky language in which to both enunciate and maintain a clean line, but I've heard it done... just not here.

It can nontheless be ordered now through his website for those who, understandably, can't wait until then.\n\nHaving heard a few of the songs from the album at earlier shows, and hoping they presaged a set of songs that engendered the excitement of the first album, I didn't want to rush into comment for fear of letting my hopes run away with me. But now I know the whole set a good deal finer and, without being a retrograde step,  they are a return to the things that first grabbed me about Scott Matthews.\n\nGone is what was, in hindsight , the slightly over-blown band sound of Elsewhere and here is a determinedly intimate and up-close album, concentrating on the Mr M's vocals and guitar work, an album of rare delicacy and lightness of touch. After hoping for an album like this, what a triumph, what a relief!\n\nAlthough the band takes more of a back seat, there are none the less some most distinguished supporting musicians - Sam Martin on drums and percussion,  Greg Stoddard on lap steel (even more rewarding in a live situation), the fine Danny Keane on cello and Danny Thompson on double bass.\n\nAs suggested by the title, What the Night Delivers, is in many respects music made for the dark, the quiet, the solitary long drive on night-time country roads - not an album to get them out and dancing in the aisles, and thank goodness for that.\n\nThere are tantalising echoes of the first album Passing Stranger - not just in the atmosphere, but some of the structures, perchance not quite so overt this time, but still there - the almost-tracks such as at the very start before Myself Again and once more the last minute of Crummy Apple leading into So Long, My Moonlight -  musical cameos, splendid in their own way but also creating a little more space and air between songs.\n\nAlso in evidence is the Indian influence of before - notably in the alluring walking Home in the Rain, but fleeting glimpses elsewhere in rhythms and intervals, the tabla on Crummy Apple for instance.\n\nTo my mind there is not a weak track here, but that doesn't mean that there aren't a few particular stand-out tracks, for me these include Ballerina Lake, Head First into Paradise, Echoes of the Lonely, the aforementioned Walking Home in the Rain.\n\nThe album gives off the same vibe that you get from Scott's more intimate and stripped back shows (such as the two Wolverhampton shows at Newhampton Arts  - in 2011  and 2009 ). These are personal and direct, uncluttered by unnecessary effects and additions, and similarly here on this album everything has a place and a purpose. A joy and delight form start to finish, anyone yet to catch him live should make the effort for the dates in the autumn, you cannot fail to be impressed. I hope Mr M doesn't mind but below I have popped my own little vid of The Man Who Had Everything from the Wolverhampton show just recently - apologies for the light level - should he not want it here I will happily remove, but it does give a hint of how the new material comes over live.","3436":"Sometimes this happens when you're legally blind.\n\nIt is the only version of a semi-signature song for sale....but it is not at all the iconic version.

Then we got all the others who really suck and I just loathe michael jackson because he's gay for raping little boys... Enough said. Jpop is waaaaay finer!","3439":"Adore this song! I had some free FLAC credit and decided to acquire this song since it is really a kick ass version of Hatsune Miku songs. Plus, I don't have to rewatch the video a million times anymore because now I have the movie on my FLAC player, woot!","3440":"No real advice, no real application of the laws of attraction to weight loss. Rather, it's an anecdotal story that turns into an advertisement for another book and website [...] Seriously, don't bother.","3441":"Wrong version!","3442":"None of the songs on this FLAC album are original.  All the other songs are reproductions by other bands.  While the recording quality of the songs is fine, they are lackluster when compared to the originals.  If having close approximations to the songs is okay with you, then you get a lot of songs for the cash.  But otherwise, pass on this album and acquire one with the original tunes, or acquire the FLAC's one by one.","3443":"After hearing 2 songs from this guy before this album dropped, I figured it would be a decent album with just raw rapping and not much actually being said.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe album is entirely produced by Tony Mahoney from the UK, and the beats are all very dark and depressing, none of them being traditional hip-hop type beats, the instrumentation ranges from horns to an upright bass even to an accordion on one track. The album is 12 tracks divided into 3, 4 track parts. To simplify the three parts they could be labelled as Sadness, Anger, and Self-Analysis respectively, while through the whole project he struggles in his fight with alcohol. By the end of the first track you realize that this album is going somewhere serious and you're in for a ride, when you get to the third, The Underground, you start to figure out 24's opinion on hip-hop is very atypical. Not to call it right or wrong, but he doesn't want to make ignorant club bangers an street anthems, but he also not concerned with getting the fans away from it. He expresses the intent to make his music the way he likes it because hip-hop isn't worth saving for an ignorant audience. Track 4 comes in, the melody of the beat is a lady singing in Spanish over the harmony of an acoustic guitar. He keeps the song relevant to the album, furthering his status as a loner while flexing his raw rapping skills more than any other track on the album. Ridiculous bars such as \"Take a shot to the head and listen to Cobain.\" and \"Thinking you on C's level but you 20,000 leagues under me.\" and a double time spat clean enough to make Tech N9ne nervous. Enter part 2, Anger. Cam feels the need to say \"F*** you\" to a lot of people, starting with fans that won't leave him alone on The Neverending Story of The Parasite, asking them\n\n\"Wanna go to my school and get my degree for me? Go to my job and work these 40 hours a week for me? Come up with these ideas and think for me? Have battles every night with these drinks for me? You wanna know how it feels to always be drunk at home? How it feels to live life without a comfort zone? No? Alright cool then stop asking me stupid questions and leave me the f*** alone.\"\n\nThe next target is the record executives pushing young artists into neglecting their skills and churn out simple mega-hit singles, the last target is the government on The Warden, I felt this song was misplaced, it fits the mood of the album but not the themes so much. I briefly discussed the album with 24\/7 himself and he said he felt the same way while writing it, but he explained it as he's so angry with the world at this point in the album that he's getting everything off of his chest all at once before he gets into the final act. One thing in particular I liked about The Industry and The Warden was that in the first verses of each he rapped from the perspective of the record executive pushing the rapper to sign the contract and the government official filling our heads with propaganda and assuring us that they know what's best respectively.\n\nPart three is at least as personal as the first, probably more. My Apologies delivers precisely what it promises, he realizes that he is just as flawed as everyone he has spouted off at. Now that he's alone he's arduous to make amends for all the isolation he has placed himself in. Battle Cry has the most positive vibe of any song of the album, almost as if he's sobered up and cheered up, starting to realize where he stands in life.\n\nTrack twelve comes in. It started with the sound of empty bottles clanging together, and he almost-mumbles the words \"They say alcohol is man's lowest enemy, but the bible says to adore your enemy. That's word to Frank Sinatra babyyyyy.\" The song is almost like a relapse, he displays a mixture of cockiness, and frustration almost as if he's back to where he was in the first two parts. The piano and upright bass keep playing long after the lyrics end, and that's it.\n\nThis is 100% honestly one of the best albums I've ever heard. It's genuine, personal, and poetic. At 22 years old, and this being his 1st album, an unreal potential to do something very big for rap is shown.\n\n\"I won't be compared to Eminem, Lil Wayne or Hov. More like Fitzgerald, Hemmingway and Poe.\"\n-24\/7","3444":"I had the great privilege of seeing Josh perform the role of Judas Iscariot in \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" this week.  His performance took my literal breath away, so I went home and acquired his newest music, and was not disconcerted.  Only further intrigued!\n\nI am not a music critic, only a fan of music, so forgive me that my criticism is not technical.  Only  emotional!\n\nJosh's voice pours out like honeyed wine.  Yes, it is sweet, but he can also deliver such sadness and pathos, that adds a tartness, a crispness to songs we have heard before.  The song \"When She Loved Me\" was a great cherished of mine already, and this rendition is so singular, so moving.  I found a new respect for the lyrics, and for how artists intrepret various songs.\n\nI am not ashamed to say my eyes welled up during \"The Rainbow Connection\", a song that lovers and dreamers have adopted for 30 years.  He deliver a gorgeous voice to the sentiment, and it's never corny or false, the feeling comes through and touches, even penetrates the listener.\n\nEvery song carries Josh's passionate, but angelic stamp.  He is the angelic voice that is burnished by a fiery humanity.  I recommend his music to any and every one who wants to be moved, transcended.\n\nI have wishlist of songs that I would adore to see Josh do for his next project, but would be equally happy with whatever he chose to interpret.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Still-Dreaming-of-Paradise\/dp\/B005JOH4HO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Still Dreaming of Paradise<\/a>","3445":"Haven't lisyened to the whole thing yet but what I have heard so far is great.

You can't find the soundtrack here at Amazon. iTunes has it, but I presume criticisms have said it is only at 128kbps (weird). Also, you have to acquire the entire album to get just the one piece of music (weirder), and the producer of this soundtrack pondered it would be cool to sprinkle dialogue from the film throughout (weirdest), which I don't find so cool, personally (this isn't a campy Flash Gordon movie).\n\nIf you want only this track, I don't know anywhere to get a finer version of it than this, even if it is just a cover.","3447":"Saw this on Broadway and at one point caught myself starting to doze off. Working only made it to Broadway on the strength of Schwartz's Godspell and Pippin, of which this can't come close to in any way. The score is ghastly, amateurish, and absolutely forgettable. Even the Broadway production felt like a community theater endeavor. It's no wonder it is rarely listed among Stephen Schwartz's many accomplishments. A formidable composer, even his bomb, The Bakers Wife has finer music. Actually it has a ravishing score, but a book that can't seem to work.\nEither way if you are expecting any one thing on a par with Godspell, Pippin, or Wicked..forget it. Working is crummy, pure and simple, stay away.","3448":"didn't read the criticisms or descriptions.  I just assumed it was all instrumental so imagine my surprise when the dude's voice comes in half way through.

Worth 4 STARS.\nRegrettably the Quality of the FLAC is only worth 2 STARS.","3451":"Anemic. Probably is the key word. But it probably isn't the best rather the lowest.","3452":"When romance is in the air, nothing accentuates it quite like the right music, which, when done properly, has the power to magnify forceful emotions and moods. \"Fall In Adore,\" by singer\/songwriter\/producer Ginger Patterson is a ballad that is almost undefinable. Containing both traditional and unconventional elements, it is like a fine, abstract piece of art; everyone who listens to it will hear something different, but it is open to interpretation and there is most definitely something there to appreciate.\n\nThe song begins with an interesting guitar, strings, and a piano melody that sets up the entrance of Ginger's sensual voice. Lyrically strong, \"Fall In Adore\" tells of the things that are alluring about being in adore.  Ginger has a range of tones within her voice, and is capable of quickly and smoothly transitioning from a soft breathy sound to a full tone, with a touch of gospel conviction in her delivery, and very solid background harmony on her vocal overdubs. More tasteful keyboard sounds appear on the second verse, along with drums, a tambourine, and clever production ideas with regard to breaks in the phrasing, bringing cool surprises. In music, timing is everything. When you do something is just as important as how, and much pondered was given not to overuse a sound just for the sake of doing so. The chords are solid and flow well with the way Ginger arranged her vocals, which are gripping in just the right places, pulling the lyrics and music together in a way that will remind listeners of adores past and present. Ginger has a unique voice and vocal style, but it is one that this listener appreciates.","3453":"First off, this guy has a big ass \"Pumpkinhead\" shaped skull, so I'm guessing his parents never turned him as a baby.

Even though I was into a rather obscure musical blend, they still managed to pull out a track that I was instantly drawn to. Now, I could have walked away from there, but rather acquired this CD from them in person for $20.00 - All the tracks on the disc kept me listening.\n\nI fathom in conclusion - I have to give them 4.5 stars (-.5 because although I like the music, it's still outside of my normal genre), and for providing me with an awe-inspiring disc to listen to.\n\n-Lobster\u20ac","3457":"Careless adore is the best slice.

The songs are beautifully constructed and Gary's vocals are right on at the right times and they crack just at the points that need to be there. The guitar licks often sound as if several people are playing. His voice often sounds like a young George Jones or a beer soaked Johhnny Thunders. There are several magnum opus country covers (Tall, Tall Trees, Looking At The World Trough a Windshield and Spotlight.

The actual piece is a truncated 25 second slice from the entire song. Asking $0.99 for it led me to presume that time listing on the site was in error. After all, who in their right mind would offer a 25 second slice from a song for the same price as a full track? Well, obviously, Amazon.com would. That's ridiculous!

Nontheless, that would be fine with me I'm always looking for a new sound.  But it wasn't any one thing like good either.  He sings on almost all tracks and sounds like a drunk guy singing kareokee at a Moose Lodge. I see very little skill or talent in this album.  Perchance the kids get it but I sure don't","3464":"First of all, I'd like to thank Amazon for making this recording available as downloadable Flac's. At the moment (9\/6\/15), this CD is not available, but the disc with both Beach Boys Songbooks can be had for $466-!400.00. In other words, essentially unavailable. I've noticed that Amazon is beginning to do this with other out of print CD's, usually 60's catalog, and I can only encourage them to do more of this because there is an audience out there for these titles if they're not $100.\n\nThe Hollyridge Strings were actually a rather radical belief for their day. Until they put out The Beatles Songbook in June, 1964, teen-pop, the music of Top 40 Radio, was generally considered off-limits for an accessible listening instrumental treatment. You didn't here orchestral arrangements of the hits of Fabian, Dion and the Belmonts or the Everly Brothers on the radio or in restaurants and offices. Those songs were kids' songs and the whole genre of rock'n'roll was considered musically worthless. Then came the Beatles and that changed everything. By March, 1965 Time Magazine ran a cover story on the pop\/rock scene, by Autumn, 1965 the Beatles would record Yesterday with a string quartet and get airplay on \"Adult\" stations and by 1967 Leonard Bernstein would be praising pop on a network TV special.\n\nBut this was in 1964, long before all that, when the belief of orchestral arrangements of Beatles and Beach Boys songs must have seemed like a crazy belief. The project may have been just Capitol Records (who were the Beatles U.S. label) way of further jumping on the Beatlemania Bandwagon as everybody else was arduous to do, or it may have been a creative person at Capitol recognizing the melodious sound of the Beatles songs and how it would easily transpose. The work in any case fell to Stu Phillips, a noted composer-arranger whether or not it was his original belief. He was a graduate of the Eastman School of Music who had made accessible listening albums for Capitol under his own name, and for Colpix Records produced hit songs Johnny Angel (Shelly Fabares), My Dad (Paul Peterson), Blue Moon (Marcels) and Goodbye Cruel World (James Darren). It was this familiarity with contemporary pop that gave him the ability to orchestrate it without losing its vitality.\n\nThe Beach Boys Songbook was the second release by the Hollyridge Strings who, of course, were whatever studio orchestra musicians Capitol had at the time, and it came out in the Fall of 1964. The sound of the orchestra is very transparent (helped by distinguished remastering here), with the strings accompanied by horns, trumpets, flutes and extensive use of piano. As you'd expect, songs like Don't Worry Baby and In My Room lend themselves easily to this treatment, and She knows Me Too Well is a particular standout with its elaborate piano part. But the more rocking songs come out intact with all their punch, even Surfin' USA and I Get Around, which boldly leads off the album. This is no sleepy Mantovani strings oversaturating the tunes but an authentically creative reimagining of Brian Wilson's melodies that retains their spirit.\n\nThis album got as much play from me as the actual Beach Boys albums in late 1964 (note because Capitol also had the Beach Boys a tune like Wendy which was on the Top 40 when this album was released was able to be included). Stu Phillips went on to compose many movie scores and television themes and is noted for his music for Battlestar Gallactica.","3465":"This is fine but i would suggest buying only a few of these mp3s separately you aren't missing any one thing cash cash every where and many 2 or 3 more including the affirmations track.\ni think perchance this wasn't what i pondered it would be this si about providing good service to your customers, i lack appropriate opportunities so perchance i should search for that\nbut ive ran into this dilemma before with her albums but i still was able to grow and still received something positive out of it\nfine i am editing my criticism 4\/27\/16 from four stars to 2 (being nice)\nfine heres why i will not purchase her FLAC again.\neven though there were aspects of this FLAC i did not like i still used it. i noticed my attitude twords other people changed, i started getting more of a \"kanye west\" syndrome and presume that i shouldn't have to work for my success (as suggested in this FLAC)  i actually shouldntve acquired the whole cd.\nbut what i will say on a positive bullet is that i enjoy less about others and feel as though people should pay me regardless ... i was actually raised to be the best i can be and its very hard and immoral to do some of the things suggested here.\nhonestly im not in a situation to \"pick and choose\" things often. so to pick and choose things based on \"quality\" is not a healthy option. i think this FLAC should have been more well pondered out as everyone's situations are different. though it has given me courage to do things that needed to be done in a less than merciful way. what hurts the most is the acknowledgement of people who do not work hard who achieve massive success. i think this made my situation worse and more depressing if any one thing. i mean obviously a person buying this self help FLAC works hard and deserves more cash nontheless suggesting to be like those just born lucky is a hard pill to swallow im unhappy.\nive worked hard my whole life and all it did was bring to light that i am NOT wealthy as i should be. as in my preceding reveiw i would suggest to purchase cash cash everywhere. the othe mp3s are for people who probably do not work hard and ARE meager. oh and the other one about having a roommate who doesnt clean up after them selves is good. but i would never recommend this to a loved one as a whole FLAC\/cd just those 2. i found a similar FLAC by hypnosis live which says what she say but in a shorter yet more GRACEFUL way.\nwhat anna thompson usually does are audio shamanic journeys. i think if your into that you will probably acquire her mp3s but the dilemma is trusting what she is saying. so in conclusion the only thing positive that happend is me firing people who i should have fired along time ago.\nall of the other results im not comfortable with oh yeah & one of those is starting accounts one to conserve and one to give away... um i stopped being as generous a long time ago because i honestly do not have the cash to be donating to charities & i subconsciously had been giving me thinking \"oh it will come back\" after i realized why i stopped giving so much..its cuz I DON'T HAVE THE CASH! i noticed after i realized i had less cash. it makes me look like im rich to other people who probably want to use me though i don't know how great that is.\nim glad i could do it in the future but right now i really need all of my cash and can not afford to be Ms generosity all of the time people should be generous to me more often ijs cuz i really aint got it like that.\ni think her intentions are good but for something like this i would suggest something more customized.","3466":"I first heard this song by Johnny Wakelin in 1975.

So basically I had to acquire it twice. Once from Amazon and again from another vendor.","3468":"Please don't get me wrong - Agostino Steffani's music is fine. It's just this performance and recording that are harrowing, and I already described the reasons why in a 2009 criticism under Amazon's other entry for this recording:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Alarico\/dp\/B001U1L9ZI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Alarico<\/a>. Nontheless, I've been prompted to take a fresh look at it, and of course to do some more listening, after the sudden recent appearance of two glowing four-star criticisms, appearing on both this and the other product page (although in the latter case, I see, they have both been deleted again at the same time today, February 18th 2015), praising this recording in similar and very fulsome terms.\n\nThose two criticisms were posted by reviewers Magda Levi and Yoav Rothberger, both gilding the lily by adding admiring comments on each other's work. (Stop press: since reading the rest of this, they've now changed their Amazon names to 'ML' and 'A Customer' respectively. Hang on - now they've both deleted their criticisms on this page as well, and all their other Amazon criticisms!) I'll avoid commenting on the details of the latter's criticism directly - firstly because, apart from the last paragraph, all the rest has been copied word for word from an entry by Bruno Belli on the website of Luca Casagrande, director and singer in this recording, so there isn't really any one thing plausible or significant by Mr. Rothberger himself to comment on. Secondly, that reviewer evidently doesn't take kindly to anyone expressing an opinion different from his own, but prefers to resort to ill-mannered language and personal insults to try to prove his point - as could be seen from the comments after the first criticism I wrote, again on the other product page cited above, although he has since deleted those comments. And thirdly, Mr. Rothberger appears to have a small claque of baroque music enthusiasts at his disposal, who are happy to vote in support of all his comments and to class as unhelpful any comments by anybody else - all, as if by magic, within just a few minutes of the comments being posted. Perchance a similar fate awaits the present criticism!\n\nThis leaves me with Magda Levi's criticism, which contains substantial passages copied word for word, without any acknowledgment, from Chapter 8 of Professor Colin Timms' monograph&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Polymath-of-the-Baroque-Agostino-Steffani-and-His-Music\/dp\/0195154738\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Polymath of the Baroque: Agostino Steffani and His Music<\/a>&nbsp;- from the section entitled `Music and drama in `Alarico il Baltha' '. Ms Levi also has connections with Luca Casagrande's website, having recently contributed some material to it. Nontheless, Ms Levi does also add some points of her own to her `Alarico' criticism here on Amazon, so I will address some of these. In particular, she singles out a number of the singers for fulsome praise - several of whom, to my ears, sound absolutely dreadful and sing wildly out of tune. In my preceding criticism, I struggled to avoid causing too much offense by not naming the lowest singers individually, and I will repeat that concession here - except in the case of Luca Casagrande, who directs the ensemble and also sings the important baritone role of Pisone. He sings frequently and painfully out of tune, and must also take overall responsibility for this mostly harrowing performance and recording.\n\nReviewer Ms Levi also makes the point that this was a young cast of singers, around 30 to 35 years of age. Perchance this is with a view to our making allowances for their youth or inexperience; but are we really expected to make such extreme allowances when we pay out the substantial cost of a three-disc opera set? Besides, I would say that if they can't sing in tune - or at all - by that age then they're unlikely to get much finer over the next 35 years.\n\nThis recording has a few assets - for example, the able and stylish playing by the instrumentalists of the Scarlatti Camera Ensemble, and the singing of such as mezzo Lee Ji-Young (Honorio) and soprano Won Mi-Jung Capilupi (Placidia); bass Marco Democratico (Lidoro) is not too crummy either, at least having a decent voice if not great style. The greatest asset of all, of course, is Steffani's music, and I'd greatly adore to hear it in a decent recording. But here, I'm unhappy to say, much of it is ruined by the meager singing and close, harsh, wiry recorded sound. To take just a couple of examples, Stilicone's alluring chaconne-based aria in Act 1, Scene 15, `Gelosia, lasciami in pace' is wrecked by meager singing and dreadful sound quality; and the lovely duet between Semiamira and Stilicone in Act 3 Scene 3, `Enjoy Fiamme\/ Amate Catene', is ruined by the same factors.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that Steffani's roles intended for male altos are sung here by mezzo and contralto - a practice praised by some reviewers and criticised by others. In fact there appears to be a small but persistent lobby, noticeable among certain reviewers both here and on the Italian Amazon website, who are firmly prejudiced against the countertenor voice and on that basis attempt to discredit the work of great singers such as Philippe Jaroussky and Claudio Cavina.\n\nReturning to the main business, nontheless, the principal drawbacks of the present recording are dreadful singing, ghastly recorded sound and the absence of any sense of involvement, drama or cohesion. And, if there were any argument at all for scoring it with a second star - which in my view there isn't - I'd immediately take one star off again for dodgy practices. If musicians seek public approval for their work, they would do much finer to come up with a few decent performances and recordings, rather than produce something like this effort and then try to get their supporters to rig the criticisms. Most of us here on Amazon, whether readers or reviewers, are not that stupid.","3469":"Fine, I am a gargantuan Hank III fan but this new \"3 Bar Ranch - Cattle Callin\" is ABHORRENT!!!

That version is 1:54, while this one is just over 3:40.  (I acquired both.)  This one seems to be the full-length track while the other seems to be the slice version that runs into and during the Princess Jellyfish closing credits.  (At least, I'm pretty sure that's the difference.  According to YouTube, the runtime on the closing credits is around 1:30, and that's *without* about 25-30 seconds of the \"Adore is coming back\" bit and the musical lead-in to the primary lyrics. And btw, both versions include the intro.)  While this particular compilation credits the composer\/arranger (Yamaguchi Takashi), it doesn't credit the artist, which Google tells me is Sambomaster.\n\nSuch a cute song!

It's Everyday Magic, the second album from Nashville native, Rahsaan Barber\n\nWhat's more, this album was recorded in Nashville - Music City USA. Nashville may be forever associated with country music, but, let me tell you, they have some cats down there that can blow. The band, also called Everyday Magic, is composed of Barber on tenor, alto and soprano sax as well as flute. Adam Agati on guitar, pianist Jody Nardone, Jerry Navarro on bass (and what a tasty bottom end he plays) and Nioshi Jackson on the skins. Rahsaan's twin brother, Roland Barber is on trombone on two hot tracks, as is percussionist Giovanni Rodriguez.  The album is released on Rahsaan's newly formed Jazz Music City label.\n\nThe album is laid out to display Rahsaan's virtuosity on all the saxes and flute, as well as his various influences. It opens with a bopping tenor show case tune, \"Jubilee\".The first thing that becomes apparent is Rahsaan's articulation on whatever instrument he features. It matters not how fast the tune, the clarity of the notes are astonishing. This tune just grooves and deliver back recollections of John Coltrane or Kenny Garret.\n\nfrom there, Rahsaan and the band cover the whole spectrum a jazz influences, Bop, Avant Garde, Gospel, Blues. Perchance my cherished tune on the whole album is \"Why So Blue\", an in-your-face blues romp that'll make you think of Stanley Turrentine. Twin brother, Roland Barber is featured on some fine trombone work where he seems to be echoing Rahsaan's gritty tenor. Great work, family style.\n\nAnother highlight is, \"Innocence\", featuring soprano sax work that continues to show of Rahsaan's mastery of the different saxophones. The drummer, Nioshi Jackson,  lays down an infectious stutter-step solo and the interplay between the sax and the guitar is just killer. Close your eyes, and you can see a couple of kids playing in a spring garden. In \"Adagio\", Rahsaan finally shows off his flute work. As the title suggests, this is a sweet, quiet, slow tune. Rahsaan says it was composed on a dare to create a meditative spa kind of music. The album closes out with \"Memphis Soul\", a tight, electronic groove featuring percussionist Giovanni Rodriguez of the Latin-jazz septet, El Movimeinto which is co-lead by Rahsaan.\n\nThis is a great debut for the label and a more than fine sophomore effort from Rahsaan and Everyday Magic.  It may not be elevator music, but it is going nowhere but up.","3472":"I adore this song because it talks about vulnerabilities, and I think that's something that everyone can relate to. Alluring song, with alluring vocals.","3473":"I was able to get the whole album for $4, so how could I say no? By the way, Demi Lovato has a lovely voice and is not to be discredited. NONTHELESS, I did acquire it mainly for the Iyaz song that I put on my Wish List months earlier.\n\nI listen to it, then I click repeat. Bass is thumping, very upbeat...just acquire it.","3474":"Until Tony MacAlpine was forced to form a hair rock ensemble in late 1990, the disparity between 1988's \"Children\" and 1990's \"Carved In Sand\" represented the single biggest drop off in quality between consecutive albums in the history of recorded music.  True, \"Children\" was an aberration - great music, good lyrics, splendid order, outstanding mix, lush orchestrations and tons of vision.  Never before had The Mission risen to that level and, sadly, never would they approach it again.  \"Carved In Sand\" has none of the aforementioned elements.  The titles alone betray the lack of ideas.  When your opener is inspired by an ABC TV special, you know there's trouble.  \"Into The Blue\" isn't a half crummy song until Reeves Gabrels shows up (and ruins it).  \"Butterfly On A Wheel\" suffers from boredom more so than any one thing.  I'd critique \"Sea Of Adore\" except I can't remember a note from it.  \"Deliverance\" almost delivers until Simon Hinkler unveils perchance the most bothersome guitar tone of its time.  The ennui resumes in \"The Grapes Of Wrath\" (check out Camel's \"Dust And Dreams\" for a slightly more compelling treatment of John Steinbeck's novel).  You're so disenchanted that by the 7th track, \"Belief\" you are momentarily deceived into thinking it's a good song.  Nontheless, 4 minutes into the 7 minute opus, when you realize you're just hearing the same belief over and over and over and over, well, the luster lessens.  I would later learn it's best to stop the CD after \"Belief\" because the spiral downward (with apologies to Trent Reznor) is steep.  Honestly, how can any song titled \"Paradise Will Shine (Like The Moon Tonight)\" be any good?  Answer:  it can't (and isn't).  I don't remember a thing about \"Hungry As The Hunter\" other than an bothersome \"yeah, yeah!\" that followed every chorus.  \"Lovely\" I presume is a brief acoustic piece that feature's Hussey non-too-lovely speaking voice.  All in all, this is a terribly written, dreadfully performed, incompetently recorded (by Tim Palmer, of all people) and downright insulting piece of half-baked nonsense.  The band itself was so disillusioned that they released all their outtakes in the hopes that they actually had an belief somewhere (1991's \"Grains Of Sand\").  It took me exactly 7 listens to decide The Mission had gone to hell in a handbasket and to eliminate it from my collection.  13 years later, I still loathe every note on it (at least where there are notes to loathe).","3475":"The song was not by Master P. Failure.","3476":"David Bethany - True Adore (Independent)\nSouth Carolina singer-songwriter David Bethany has certainly earned his musical spurs. He's the ex-frontman of The Killer Whales (check out their 1983 album \"Emotional Geography\" - produced by Jamie Hoover), and he's shared stages with Bonnie Raitt, Richard Thompson, Johnny Winter, George Thorogood, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Molly Hatchet. They say variety is the spice of life and anyone who's been musically involved with such a diverse group of artists must like mixing it up. So it is on \"True Adore\", where he employs island rhythms, ska guitars, Americana melodies and blue moves. His voice, somewhere between Jackson Browne and John Hiatt, is accessible and likeable, and adds some magnum opus `70s singer-songwriter flair to a collection of songs that feel personal and real.\n\nHighlights come thick and fast. The title track makes an immediate impression with its Caribbean beat, hint of brass and a song (and vocal) that should be owning daytime BBC radio. \"Scotch for Supper, Cigarettes for Dessert\" almost lives up to its title, and features the most restrained and gentle of guitar solos; the sort of thing that JJ Cale would be proud of. \"Can't Hold On\" cruises dangerously close to perfection. An organ fed melody releases a country-rock groove, then a wandering trumpet mirrors the tune and takes it off to alluring new worlds. It's an inspired three and a half minutes, and will undoubtedly be a massive hit in some as yet undiscovered parallel universe, where such things as genuine soul and tender, heartfelt songwriting are coveted.","3477":"My friend took my account and acquired a whole bunch of songs on here so I'll give them all a neutral rating, meaning: I'm not going to listen to the songs or do any research on 'em before I criticism. So it's a vey nice free form jazz composition equipped with juvenile humour that one would expect from Jack Black. His rhymes are nice, but not as good as Watsky's. Crush. Kill. Destroy. Swag.","3478":"This is a fine song by Matthew West that really touched my heart especially since I had already acquired the DVD, \"The Heart of Christmas\".  My cherished songs are \"The Heart of Christmas\" and \"One Last Christmas\" because they remind me of the brave little boy, Dak, who died of leukemia after a such a long battle.  This song tells of how a town came together to give this little boy one last Christmas to remember before he died.  I know I will play this song, the movie soundtrack and the movie, \"The Heart of Christmas\" during the Christmas holiday this year and all the years to come.  Always remember as one of the songs says to cherish each moment with your children, parents, and all your other loved ones as if it is the last.  Also, don't ever forget to tell them how much you adore them, and don't take it for granted that they should know.  You never know when something might happen unexpectedly.  You don't ever want to regret not having said everything you needed to say to them while they are still here.  We all only have one chance in life, let's make the most of it, and cherish each moment like it is our last, especially with our loved ones!  Always remember the true meaning of Christmas is not getting presents, it's the  celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ!","3479":"This is a fine song! This alluring lullaby is poignant and alluring. The music is astonishing and the vocals on the entire album are First-rate! I'm blown away by how beautifully they have made the scripture into lullaby. This song is just splendid and my son and I adore it! The splendid encouraging lullaby for your sweet child. I SUPREMELY recommend this entire album!","3480":"As a Christian music enthusiast, I often run across an individual or a band that has yet to be discovered by others. Nontheless, it is a rare moment when my ears are pleased and my heart is touched. On one such occasion I was relaxing at home watching \"Reflections\". Daystar produces this television program which showcases nature-loving videos with scripture notes accompanied with mostly instrumental melodies.\n\nOn this one specific night I had my eyes closed and suddenly this voice began to awaken and touch my soul. Then the message began to sink in and I had to rewind it to find out who it was. When they first started singing he reminded me slightly of Chris August but as the song continued it was more like the style of Jason Upton. It was melodically and lyrically alluring. To my delight the person's name was a mystery causing me to speak to myself like I was Sherlock Holmes.\n\nKristian Binion was the answer to the riddle at that moment and God is the master of his talent. A graduate from Christ for the Nations International he learned early on what the significance of a close relationship with Jesus Christ deliver to writing. With gifted musicians like Kari Jobe and others you have to wonder, what does this University instill in their students that other colleges do not?\n\nI received his current EP, which sadly only includes three songs. The first single on the album is the notable song I heard that evening and title of the EP, \"Pieces\". It speaks about how fragile we are and how often times we don't feel worthy of repair. Nontheless, God sees us as a moldable project as He restores us and makes us new.\n\nThis song really touched my heart as I sit discovering this artist as he moved my spirit. It is so personal and speaks to those who have a broken and contrite heart. At some point we all experience moments of heartbreak and desperation. It could be the loss of a loved one or a feeling of rejection. It could also be backslider who was once close to God who has fallen and is arduous to find their way back. All of these scenarios fit the message, along with many others I have not mentioned. The closing segment is one of the most forceful lyrics I have heard recently. \"When this world pushes my heart to break. But every piece of it sings your praise. If it takes falling to see your face, then somebody push me for Heavens sake.\"\n\nKristian's heart is all about making God famous and hoping his worship will touch someone that calls for to know that God is the answer to every dilemma they will ever face. We all have broken pieces or areas the world has vexed us in and if we turn everything over to Him, He can make something out of us to use for His glory. I have found myself asking God to keep me broken so that I never want to leave His side. Being near to God at all times is vital to our spiritual health and growth.\n\nI cannot express to you how gifted this young man is. You just have to be inclined to discover him for yourself. I do presume that he has a gargantuan future ahead of him musically and spiritually leading people in worship and to a closer walk with Christ through his ministry.\n\nThe second song on the release is titled \"Narrow Way\". This is a message that is urgent for the Body of Christ today and the title is exactly what it is about. Many people today are on the broad path that leads to destruction. They have been tossed about with every wind of doctrine and spoon fed grace to a point they feel a personal relationship and repentance is not required of them. Kristian lays his heart on the floor before the Lord in this alluring adoration of a man desiring to exemplify Christ. \"I wanna say what you would say. I wanna adore the same way. Until everything I do is a reflection of you. I will follow the path you've made along the narrow way. There's a ladder you can climb to pull yourself up to the sky. But you will be sure to find you will fall if you get to high. But that ladder it leads back down where the humble and broken are found.\"\n\nAfter listening to the third song \"Strong Tower\", I was extremely unsettled about the fact that there were no more for me to listen to. This song brought out a different sound from Kristian and I had a hard time deciding which I liked finer. It was at that point that I decided God's splendid number is three and this EP is one hundred and ten percent fascinating. That being said I am looking forward to seeing what God has in store for this extraordinarily gifted young man.\n\nEager to see how long I was going to have to wait to hear more from Kristian, I asked him when he was going to bless us all with a full length album.\n\nKristian - \"I'm currently writing new songs to go along with a lot more that didn't make the EP. I am praying and believing God for a full-length record someday. I know it will happen in His timing. Meanwhile, I plan to start recording some acoustic videos of new songs that God has given me. Those should be coming very soon!\"\n\nAs someone who is passionate about writing for God I asked what advice Kristian would share with others who have a dream to sing and minister and to share God with others in song.\n\nKristian - \"I would say don't ever let any one thing stop you! Not even yourself! I struggled for a long time with not feeling adequate or good enough. It wasn't until I surrendered to God and stopped worrying about what people pondered. I started reading the word and seeking Him and God started dropping songs in my heart. I would tell God how you feel, ask Him to write through you. It may not come right away but God is faithful and He will begin to birth songs in your heart that will draw people to Him.\"\n\nToday you see a lot of youth struggling with choices either to fit in at school or with their friends outside of school. They are willing often times to sacrifice the gifts God has placed in them to use for His Kingdom for momentary popularity. As a young man himself growing up with the temptations and trials of youth I was curious what or who influenced him to lay everything at the cross and truly walk with Christ.\n\nKristian -\" I would have to say my Grandfather, V.R. Mitchell. I was going through a time in my life where I was not really living absolutely for God. I mean, I loved God and I knew how to act and knew what to say to make it seem like we were close. But in reality I was riding the fence. While I was visiting with my Grandfather one day it was like he knew exactly what was going on. But he didn't give me a speech or tell me I was a sinner. He just very calmly grabbed my hand looked me straight in the eyes as I was leaving and said \"Son, Grab a hold of Jesus and don't ever let him Go! That's all he said but it was all I needed! Instantly I knew it was God speaking through him. And I will never forget that moment the rest of my life! That is what I would say to a young person who is struggling to fit in. DON'T FIT IN! Grab a hold Of Jesus and don't ever let Go! It's not always accessible and we are human. We will mess up. But don't ever forget to cling to Jesus it's the only way to make it.\"\n\nKristian is right we are human and we all mess up, but one thing is for certain he did everything right on this EP. Check it out for yourself and take advantage of being the first person to share his music with someone else. Trust me when I say don't let someone else steal your blessing from doing so. I hope and pray that this criticism may open doors for Kristian to explore that full-length album because I personally don't know how long I can wait to hear it.\n\nI would like to give special recognition for musicians, mixers and producers who made \"Pieces\" what it is. Thank you Daniel Lopez, Will Coleman, Josh Dufrene and Gregg Dunham for assisting Kristian by making this EP available.

On German radio I transpired to hear her play one track live - Lorelei-Marie - and found it harrowing. What's with the naive sentimentality and the oh-so-pretty vocals? Even Heather Nova or Sarah MacLachlan would be embarrassed to put that kind of oh-so-pretty triteness on one of their albums. And then came all the promotion - the website promising great things to come, the story of the album's genesis (being born during a power-slice, etc.) arduous to - literally - spark interest in what is a thoroughly unimaginative album.

It challenges the listener to actually listen to the words and music Sara has written and where she is going with it - not just listen to her alluring, angelic voice.  For me, hearing Sara's songs sung by a different artist or group has definitely caused me to delve into deeper pondered regarding all of her songs; not just the ones on \"Best of Times\".  Quite frankly, I can't think of a song Sara has released that has not been, how shall we say....\"releasable?\" She is a true ARTIST in this world, bringing her own styles and ideas not only out in the lyrics but in he instruments as well.  She definitely goes out on a limb sometimes, but is always ready to defend herself with confidence. I don't know how all of these teeny-bopper \/ american idol type people make it to the top and earn millions of dollars.  So many of them are around for a season or two, then they are in rehabs, disappeared, etc. And where is all of the fame and fortune promised to them?

Totally worth the cash as the recording is splendid.","3487":"Great song from the past, good sound","3488":"The following criticism is the result of extensive road testing on three different days and under different driving conditions, including suburban freeway, California coastline (both sunny and overcast), and suburban surface street.\nThe most striking thing about this record on a first listen is the strength and consistency of the songcraft. One after another the songs have catchy, hummable, moving, memorable tunes. \"Romeo & Juliet\" is reminiscent of the first original Lynch tune this reviewer heard (circa 1980), whose name is forgotten, but which appeared like an amalgamation of parts of four great lost Beatles songs all crammed into a single song; \"Romeo & Juliet\" also has more ideas than it calls for, though the reference points here seem closer to Bob Seeger or Tom Petty or Thin Lizzy (see below), but it puts them together in a way that makes sense. Lynch's invention is equally effective in producing anthems, swampy rockers, folk-pop, and ballads. I've heard few albums by anyone on which the songs are so consistently effective; they are radio-ready exemplars of their respective genres without being generic, and one can imagine them being successfully performed by a number of different artists.\nOn a second listen one notices the lyrics. Rock music really does, to some degree, all sound alike; it's built on clichs. Most good rock music either transcends the clichs to find the original emotional force that motivated them, or acknowledges them with some degree of usually affectionate irony. These songs do both (a rare balance: Richard Thompson is another writer who has mastered this in his rock compositions). There are plenty of cars and girls and familiar rhymes, but Lynch recognizes their familiarity. In some songs, like \"Romeo & Juliet,\" the clichs are wallowed in and milked for all their resonant effect, though the song still manages to find a new image in the struggled and true situation, such as Juliet's face illuminated by the brake light--viewed presumably in the mirror by the driver who is leaving her behind with someone else. One of the best songs on the album, \"The Best is Yet to Come,\" uses a device often used to good effect by Neil Young: mixing seemingly unrelated narratives and leaving the listener to figure out the possible connections. The haunting last line of that song (before the repeated chorus) is this reviewer's cherished of the album.\nMany of the songs reference rock music itself, and particularly its relationship to time and aging (another Youngian theme). \"Black Irish Rocker\" salutes with affectionate humor the aspirations of all rockers for authenticity, regardless of race, creed, color . . . or age. The speaker is not a teenager hoping to grow up to be guitar god but a middle aged married man who at first wistfully imagines being reincarnated as Phil Lynott, the Thin Lizzy frontman who parodixcally combined two conventional signs of authenticity, blackness and Irishness, to renew what might otherwise be the most easily parodied persona in hard rock (Irish blues guitarist Rory Gallagher provides another aspirational model of achieving authenticity by defying stereotypes). Rather than arduous to return him to reality, his wife encourages him not to dream such dreams but to try to live them. He confesses to her that \"it's been getting harder \/ to separate reality from the dream,\" to which, in a beautifully enigmatic detail, \"she smiles her little private smile to herself; \/ she says, `I know exactly what you mean.'\" There's a black Irish rocker in all of us who (to paraphrase Mr. Young) should not be denied.\nThe song titles suggest the larger theme of the album: \"The Best Is Yet to Come,\" \"Where Have All the Good Times Gone?,\" \"Rock `n' Roll Ghost.\" This is magnum opus rock about magnum opus rock that asks how we should respond when we find ourselves 20 or 30 years on and still hearing its siren promise of ecstatic fulfillment. Some rockers burn out, some fade away into conventional adulthood, but some (think again Neil Young or the Rolling Stones) demonstrate that rather than seeming absurd in the old, sticking with rock in fact helps keep them young, which is to say it sustains in them a spiritual if not physical vitality as they grow and face age and ultimate oblivion.\nMore prosaically, but further evidence of the album's implicit argument, the playing is an impressive example of DYI ethos, with Lynch playing all instruments with tasteful economy, deploying a wide variety of guitar styles as called for by the particular situation, deploying a tambourine for just a measure or two (one imagines him waiting alone in the studio through the entire song to add that important detail), or walking a nifty bass line through the spaces in the plaintive \"Grace Hollogne.\" Finally (and especially for personal friends), Lynch's vocals deserve mention. His voice seems to have deepened over the years into a seaworthy instrument weathered like the deck of a well-used and well-maintained wooden boat (perchance a gift of what one hopes is a long-abandoned smoking habit); the timbre perfectly suits the songs, but more important is the singing itself, which uses its own restraint as a source of expressiveness and authenticity.\nThere are many forms of talent on display in this record--songwriting, lyrical cleverness, musicianship, production, singing--but the deep, solid mineral vein running through it is its awareness and renewal, in each song, of the power of this sort of music to keep an aging engine oiled and running.","3489":"The belief here is that if you like Beethoven, you ought to like these other composers from Beethoven's classical era. It works for me. I already have lots of Beethoven in my collection, and lots of Mozart and Haydn who inspired Beethoven, and lots of Schubert and Weber who were the young up-and-comers weened on Beethoven. They're all here, along with Hummel, a very good but often overlooked contemporary, as well as Spohr, Sor, Cherubini, Kuhlau, Dussek, and Guiliani.\n\nWhat this collection makes me realize is that although Beethoven is said be the composer who most bridged the classical and romantic eras, he really seems to me to fit more squarely in the classical era. Two of Mozart's final works, the Requiem and Jupiter Symphony, greatly foreshadow Beethoven. When Beethoven \"went retro\" with his 8th Symphony (did he invent musical nostalgia?), he seemed to be aping Haydn's Clock Symphony. And even two of Schubert's most romantic works, the Unfinished Symphony and \"Death and the Maiden\", are still very classically structured compared with what was to come next from Liszt, Berlioz, Schumann and on. And nobody in any era ever appeared like Beethoven's later most advanced piano sonatas and string quartets.

Know how we generally extended it to cover art? Well friends, this is an album whose cover art tells you everything you need to know: A stock image of a sunset sky, with a cross overlay, with the words \"Christian Dubstep\" prominently plastered at the bottom with an ugly waveform graphic behind it, made basically invisible by the text. I was hoping that the producer was finer than the graphic designer, but alas, they are not.\n\nI was initially looking for the \"This is Christian Dubstep [year]\" series of albums I found while wandering the internet. The Amazon Music client led me here. I was particularly intrigued by the list of familiar song titles - \"Strong Tower\" by Kutless, a personal cherished, \"O Praise Him\" and \"History Maker\", two worship songs I sang in youth group, and of course \"How Great is Our God\", 2006's 'Trendy Christian song of the Year' award winner. This intrigue was evenly inspired by thoughts of \"I wonder how these songs sound as dubstep?\" and \"I wonder how much paperwork went into getting the acapellas for these tracks to make them?\" As I pondered a bit more as my poky DSL line was buffering, I was like, \"wait...this probably won't end well\", and I was right.\n\nThe vocals on all the tracks are not original - they're either karaoke tracks or separately recorded - only the lyrics are the same. The tempo and sounds used have little variance between tracks; in many cases they're flat-out off-key. They kept the exact same progression of the songs as the originals. This can be a good thing, but it's clear that the only thing that changed between copy\/pasting the 'dubstep' overlays was cutting out a measure here or there to match the different songs, rather than actually reimagining them.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily call myself a true dubstep fan, but I do DJ for youth events, so I do spend plenty of time listening to a wide variety of Christian music. Christian music is its own topic of discussion and debate, but I generally find that they tend to be 'a genre behind' secular music. Just as Christian rock started to get good, the world shifted to urban\/rap - and on the whole, the early Christian rap albums weren't that good. Christian rap started to get good - I'd dare argue 'finer than secular rap' - in the past few years, just as the world has moved on to EDM and its cousins, 'dance pop' and 'dubstep'. While artists like Har Megiddo, Matthew Parker, and a few others do a half-decent job at making some tracks worth listening to (again, the 'This is Christian Dubstep 2012\/2013\/2014' albums also having a few gems), overall, I consider this album to embody the lowest aspects of the Christian music business, genre, and culture.\n\nI *very* rarely give single star criticisms to any one thing, but when something is not only itself of meager quality, but is able to single-handedly illustrate literally every gripe I've had with Christian music in the past two decades, and the \"B-side cuts\" on other albums are finer than the best that this one has to offer, that one-star is well-earned.","3495":"When I looked up moves like jagger in the music store I clicked on the first one I saw! But that was a crummy mistake on me because when I acquired the song it didn't say who it was by! Then; the day after I but the song; I listened to it...\nAND IT WAS ABHORRENT!!! :( The guy singing the song is pitchy and the song is so kid friendly to the point where its aannoying! The only person in my family who seems to like it is my little sister; who rarely plays with my kindle!

Always pondered it was a made up expression until I heard it on the radio one day (iHeart Kool FM), then went hunting for it.","3498":"I was a gargantuan fan of this bands debut album when it came out forever ago, still am. I loved their EP, I wasn't a fan of the production on their 2nd album so never gave it much of a listen. I finally decided to give this one a chance and I have extremely mixed feelings on it. I presume this easily could have been their best work, some astonishing music on this one but the entire album is plagued by absolutely cringe worthy clean vocal choruses. Now don't take me the wrong way, I'd say I have a very open ear for this kind of music. I adore everything from Cannibal Corpse to MCR but this just really doesn't work for me. It's like throwing bands like Zao, Chimaira and Fall out boy in a blender. As much as I truly want to adore this album, I don't see it staying in my library. Dissapointing listen. Terror starts at home is a banger though!","3499":"Wess Floyd - Foxhole Confessions (Blind Roar\/TIAM)\nIt seemed for a long time that The Replacements mix of punk attitude, power pop licks and unapologetic Americana had been and gone, and potential new torch carriers were decidedly thin on the ground. Of course, bands like The Hold Steady and The Gaslight Anthem changed all that, and now let's add Wess Floyd's name to the list. Not that he's a Johnny-come-lately by any means. His debut record (\"The Daisycutters EP\") first saw the light of day as far back as 2006, and the most cursory of listens to \"Foxhole Confessions\" reveals a confident and able artist well practiced in his chosen genre.\n\nFloyd's a talented writer, with his finger on the pulse of contemporary styles. That means although his songs are decidedly retro in feel, there's nothing old-fashioned or outdated about them. Perchance that makes them timeless; I don't know, I'll need a couple hundred years to properly make sure. I do know that songs like \"Record Player\" and \"Williamsburg Nights\" deserve to be heard by lots of people. The former is an example of magnum opus, rootsy Southern power pop. Killer hooks collide with crunchy guitars, a monstrous chorus and attitude aplenty. In a just world you'd be able to acquire it on 7\" vinyl and wear it out on an old Dansette turntable, but you'll have to download it rather and use your imagination. As for the latter, it kicks in with a superb Stonesy riff before everything falls into place with soulful horns, lots of whoa-whoa backing vocals and Floyd's words, which bring to mind primetime Springsteen and Westerberg, and somehow merge New Jersey and Memphis into one.","3500":"I acquired 2 singles from this album: Tomorrow and I'll be waiting; both were under 201kbps in quality.\nTomorrow was 174kbps, and I'll be waiting was 200kbps.\nI also acquired the song Gravity from another album of hers, and it weighed in at 187kbps.\nThough I adore Mini Page's music (originals), I'm very disconcerted in these purchases. I've acquired many other songs online, and none have been less than 320kbps.\n\nI really hope that this situation will soon be rectified, because I would like to acquire all her originals.\nSadly until then, buyer beware.","3501":"(from the composer)\n\n\"Aphrodite Nights\" was composed for the gourd tree, a unique instrument microtonal instrument invented by Harry Partch, performed by Ryan McCausland.\n\nProduced by Chris Opperman.\nRecorded, mixed, and mastered by Stephen Kolakowsky.\nArtwork by Tony Akins.\nRecorded at the Harry Partch Institute at Montclair State University with special permission from Dean Drummond.\n\n\"Aphrodite Nights\" was composed for the gourd tree, one of many unique instruments invented by American composer Harry Partch (1901 - 1974).  The instrument was built on a bough of eucalyptus to which several gourds with bells have been attached, each resonating a different microtonal pitch.\n\nWhile studying microtonal music at the Harry Partch Institute in Montclair, NJ, professor and composer Dean Drummond showed us some videos of gamelan music that I found to be very fascinating and I decided to compose something that was reminiscent of that style on the gourd tree.\n\nAs fine, imaginative, and flexible language is, and although words carry tremendous meaning, I often find it difficult to use words to truly attempt to \"explain the unexplainable.\" The benefit of instrumental music is that you can communicate feelings and ideas with pure sound, from the world of the wordless into another plane, using music as a way to transport the listener into that plane.\n\nOne of the most forceful benefits of music is its ability to conjure up past recollections and feelings, and remind them of the past in the present.\n\n\"Aprhodite Nights\" is about the wild magic of adore and about those moments when two people become lost in one another, each partner being in awe of the other and giving themselves over absolutely to those feelings, exploring each others minds, hearts, and bodies with equal measures of caution and abandon.  Those evenings when time seems to stand still and that they are the only two beings in existence, subtly guided in their movements by instinct and by the power of the Goddess of Adore, Aphrodite, adore being the driving force behind existence and creativity.","3502":"I stumbled upon this group about two years ago and adore them!  They are now one of my cherished CD's to hear in my car.

In all fairness, the shockers in his discography (as known to me) are legion. His Haydn for instance is banal in the extreme; his Mozart is the musical equivalent of turbo-lax; his Beethoven is comic rather than cosmic; his Brahms induces nausea and felonious indeed is his Bruckner: other than that, he offers a welcome relief from vibrato, orchestral excellence and metaphysics for those so inclined. Much to his anguish, Roger the Hapless has been trumped in my estimation by Mehta whose bone-lazy Wagner lays claim to being Ground Zero (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ring-Hlts\/dp\/B0000026OJ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ring-Hlts<\/a>). The matter is still in doubt: black holes await investigation, one of them being Sir Roger's survey of Schumann's Symphonies with his long-suffering galley-slaves: the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra (whenever I hear these meager devils. I rethink my position on euthanasia).\n\nHere are ten reasons why this cycle warrants consideration in my quest.\n\n1. 90% of the time, Sir Roger is metrical beyond a metronome. I sense that as a child, he underwent a formative experience with a brass-band from the local colliery: there is no other way to explain his \"oom-pa-pa, oom-pa-pa, oom-pa-pa\" approach to rhythm.\n\n2. Schumann's fever-pitch mania which is so integral to his psyche is muted in each performance.\n\n3. Unrelentingly, phrases are clipped one after another. Roger the Hapless also spurns vibrato with his usual degree of dogmatism. In consequence, every bar is a test of one's stamina.\n\n4. Geez, the strings of the Stuttgart Symphony Orchestra are vin ordinaire with a vengeance. Listen to them in the slow movement of the Spring Symphony: it's moggy central - meow!\n\n5. The Scherzo of the Second is the very definition of note-spinning. I yelled aloud \"FFS Roger - do something with the music!!! Do something! Any one thing!\" Alas, the great man was too busy worrying about vibrato to respond. Thankfully we all know there is more to this music than this banal account. The slow movement is equally vapid and shallow; not even a tadpole could survive in it.\n\n6. There's no apotheosis at the end of the Second: it's just another fortissimo to Roger the Hapless.\n\n7. Where is the barely suppressed excitement in the first movement of the Rhenish? How is such an omission possible?\n\n8. Mysticism, it is safe to say, is not Roger's strong suit . . . As performed here, the fourth movement of the Rhenish has little to do with the consecration of a cardinal; it's more an evocation of chop suey.\n\n9. Yes Veronica, it is possible to play the first movement of the Fourth as if it's in a major key: that's how little 'fear and loathing' Roger is able to generate.\n\n10. The stupendous transition into the finale of the Fourth - Schumann at white heat - is mundane. It's an embarrassment to compare it with the likes of Furtwangler, Karajan, Szell and Kubelik.\n\nUndistinguished as it is, this cycle offers no real challenge to Uncle Zubin's stupendous achievement: it's more mundane and befuddled than sordid. Further afield, Roger's Brahms cycle on Hanssler is actually more horrific than this unhappy affair - but who has the wherewithal to revisit such horror when life is so short? Not me! We press on.","3506":"Glad to learn you have the FLAC upload here!  I loved this LP when it came out in 1976 and still own it.  \"Give You All The Adore (Inside Of Me)\" was the finest piece on 'Mother's Finest,' in my opinion!  Acquired two other mp3s; likely, I'll eventually acquire them all!  Thanks an amazon lot!","3507":"My 5-year-old is learning these songs and routines in dance class. He may not be the best in his class, but he ADORES it and he adores this music. This is probably the only song\/dance we don't practice at home because it's not really a dance, per se, but I can see him reviewing it in his head when we're in the car and that's good for him, knowing when the transition from Bear Crawl to Crab Walk to Frog Hop is coming up. Like the other Chris Zondaflex Tyler songs for kids, it's accessible to follow because the song tells you what to do, and that's really helpful for the kids to learn and for adults who are arduous to help them learn.","3508":"I acquired this particular FLAC because it said it was \"clean.\" The sample didn't play enough of the song to let me know if the f-bomb was not used in this version. I went ahead and ordered it and when I listened to it, it was there.","3509":"\"Requiem 3\" is the third in a series of classically-styled piano solos by Canadian\/Iranian composer\/pianist Fariborz Lachini. In keeping with the theme (a requiem is a piece composed in honor of someone's death), the eight original compositions are slow, reflective, and melancholy, but this is not a dark or depressing album. Always graceful and elegant, this is some of Lachini's most alluring and evocative music to date. A very prolific composer who has done a great deal of film soundtrack work as well as his own arrangements of Iranian folk and pop music, Lachini has a distinctive style that often reflects his own cultural influences as well as his European musical training - a true world musician! Fellow pianists will delight in the companion songbook, which is also reviewed here.\n\n\"Requiem 3\" begins with \"Farewell to Past,\" a somber piece that is bitter but not without hope. The extensive use of trills enhances the emotional quality of the piece and gives it a more classical approach. \"Secrets and Dreams\" is strongly influenced by some of Chopin's nocturnes and is a cherished. The emotional nature of the piece touches the heart and evokes a deep sigh. \"Morning Light\" is delicate, hopeful, and very moving. \"Silent Truth\" again hints of Chopin's introspective melancholy with a slowly flowing left hand and poignant melody - another cherished. \"Shadows' Fate\" has a somewhat more tragic quality with an elegant melody and gentle left hand accompaniment. \"Embrace\" is slow, graceful, and very passionate. \"Dilemma\" beautifully conveys the emotional confusion of having to make a difficult choice. Very introspective and again very poignant, it's a fine ending to an outstanding album.\n\nFans of Fariborz Lachini will be thrilled with this newest release, and if Lachini is a new name for you, this is a great way to get acquainted with his music! Recommended!","3510":"This is Annie Lennox's most haunting song that I know of.  In the heat of 110 degrees of summer, I get cooled off by Ms. Linnox's wintery lyrics.  She was still in Eyrithmics I presume and she should have been nominated for Best Original Song at the Oscars...and won.","3511":"To compensate for their minimal exposure on major labels since the Masur era ended, the NY Phil. has been hugely proactive in releasing Alan Gilbert's concerts on their house label. Every one of them seems to be available as MP3s, and one must admire the sound, which is very fine, all but miraculous considering the acoustic deficits of Avery Fisher Hall. How can it sound so ugly in real life and so lovely through a microphone? Here from October 2009 is #15 of thirty download concerts to celebrate Gilbert's first year as Music Director. The program is a crowd-pleaser featuring the Symphonic Dances from West Side Story, all but immortalized by Bernstein's own version for Columbia Records with this orchestra, and the stomping Suite No. 2 from de Falla's ballet The Three-Cornered Hat,which Bernstein also played the daylights out of.\n\nIt's both daring and nostalgic for Gilbert to follow in LB's footsteps, and I wish he had found some swing and sassiness in the West Side Story music rather of the polite, reserved, totally unconvincing performance he actually delivers.  It puts one foot ahead of the other in such a pedestrian way that I can only imagine what the old hands at the Philharmonic were thinking. This is music that defies polite handling - too crummy. At least thee are some big, brassy sounds in the Rumble, but it's weak tea compared to Bernstein's knife wielding. conducting this dull is positively un-American.\n\nThe Falla is also too polite, lacking any sense of earthiness or flamboyance. This isn't even the Spain of tourist posters, much less of the country's most famous dance piece. There's really no point in detailing a mere walk through. The signs weren't good for Gilbert to light a fire under the Philharmonic, and the only bright spot is that the musicians and critics adore him, apparently, which is a change from the dispiriting Masur and Maazel eras.","3512":"I always listen to my new music at least 3 times before I am willing to do a Amazy criticism. Learned my lesson over the last couple of months. Just because there are other great written criticisms be cautious. If the one song you like makes you then presume the rest of the music will be the same. \" Don't. \" I acquire alit of music from Amazon and it normally works out. This one plus all Griffin's don't. I acquired them as a group. I now regret it. Its up to you for me \"no.\" Do your research. Sirius radio plays the hell out one song.

Emailed Amazon ...never heard back...lost .89 cents\nnever got song....","3514":"In listening to inexpensive digital transfers of analog recordings, one notices dramatic variations in quality.  At one extreme there are superb items such as the Puccini Girl of the Golden West with Tebaldi, and at the other extreme is this meager transfer of the fine Forster version of the St. John Passion.  It is the lowest I've heard--the sound level is VERY low, and even when the sound is cranked way up, it sounds muddy and unfocused.  It's harrowing.  I own the old LP Seraphim version from the 70s, which I remembered as sounding distinguished.  I pulled out my much played LPs last night to make such I wasn't nuts--in fact, the LPs have alluring, clear, detailed sound--they're just noisy from having been played a lot.\n\nIMHO Amazon should withdraw this until something is done about the sound.  They'd be finer off with a decent version of this for the same price as the 1964 Richter recording, to which it is rather comparable.  It's disgraceful to see this fine performance subjected to such mistreatment.","3515":"such a good song. it is my cherished and my  friends adore it too. The best part is it doesn't have crummy words","3516":"This is a very welcome release.\n\nI never pondered of Ninth as a full album. Probably because I only found 7 out of 11 songs actually listenable. The others, nontheless, were his best work ever!\n\nAnd thats where this release comes in. Of the 6 songs, one is already on Ninth, and a further 2 are unlistenable. Nontheless, the remaining 3, plus the 7 on Ninth, that makes for a full, distinguished, 5 out of 5 listening experience.\n\nMost artists record more songs for an album than will actually make the final slice. Because half the songs end up not very good. In the case of Ninth it seems, all the songs made it, but across two releases. I can't say that does him any favours, because a lot of people will listen to an album and think 'wtf?' But we can be thankful we have everything now, and make our own 'splendid album' as we see fit.\n\nMy biggest gripe with Peter's recent solo work is some crummy artistic decisions on the vocals. Until recently, his performances were always flawless. Different... but flawless. He has developed the bothersome habit of singing entire songs two or three times, then pasting all the vocal tracks on top of each other, slightly out of time, and very out of tune, with some wild warbles thrown in. Backing vocals should be used sparingly, to emphasize important words or add atmosphere, but if its the entire track, it gets confusing on the ear, and sounds over-produced. 'Secret' and 'Secret Silk Society' suffer extraordinarily badly from this.\n\nWhen he sings properly though, he has an distinguished voice. And its a voice I like to hear. I can't hear how he sings if its diluted by multiple versions of the same thing. Nontheless, the song 'Good Works' suffers none of these problems. The voice is clear, solid, passionate, and haunting. The track is so good that I rated the album 4 rather of 3 on this experience alone. It might become my favourite Peter track of all time.\n\n'Secret' isn't vocally pleasing, but its passable, and the song itself is a tremendous feat of writing. Despite the fact it could have been finer, I rate it 4.\n\nThen theres the delicious 'Rose Hunter' track. It shines as a splendid companion to the splendid 'I Spit Roses' of Ninth. It has a similar structure, with vocal humming layered underneath a chorus which cuts suddenly with the word 'lovers!' (as opposed to 'spit!) Splendid. Its sung with great passion, and builds throughout.\n\nAll in all, 4 out of 5, because it completes 'Ninth' perfectly, and now I feel entire. Peter's work has always inspired me, and I'm so relieved that my confidence in his latest album can remain unscathed.","3517":"We play Christmas music non-stop from the day after Thanksgiving to 12th Night and have an extensive library of Christmas music from which to choose.\n\nThis year we choose to seek out new tracks that were either Celtic\/Olde World influenced  OR  weren't simply another rendition of the old standbys.\n\nBarra MacNeils \"The Christmas Album\" and \"The Christmas Album II\" provided some great selections. We chose to acquire selected tracks and I'll not comment on those we excluded, only the following tracks which we did indeed purchase.\n\n01 - Children's Winter - three stars\n.....Pleasing, new to most song. Plays finer (for me) as a variation after having been listening to other, more familiar or lively songs.\n\n02 - God Rest ye Merry Gentlemen - four stars\n.....A good, traditionalist rendition of a Christmas magnum opus. Gentle vocals, well harmonized and reverently (as is appropriate) performed. Nice 'Celtic' instrumental lead out.\n\n06 - Christmas Comes But Once a Year - four stars\n.....Easily meets the 'Celtic Influence' requirement. A real toe-tapping, corner pub song.

This was a deal breaker for me. It's too crummy because the music on the trailer is awe-inspiring.\n\nAnyways, there is another odd quirk about this soundtrack. None of the songs have endings. Every song just stops abruptly in mid-stride. I presume it's because these songs are intended to loop indefinitely during game play. Nontheless, producers normally provide 'completed' songs on their soundtracks. Nevertheless, this may appeal to some that want to loop the music in the back ground while reading. So, I'll give it one thumb up.","3519":"Ella Fitzgerald was a true artist and one of my all-time cherished singers.

Nontheless, I never expected it to fall so short, either.\n\nThe first track, 'A Nice Place to Visit', kicks off the album rather abruptly with a harsh scream over a pounding beat, but it's pretty much downhill from there.  As soon as the main vocals started I immediately knew this album was going to be a failure.  I loved the vocal style on AP's first two albums, but I have to say that on this release they are much hollower and far too weak to pack the same aggression as before.  I read a criticism somewhere that joked about Daniel Graves having his vocal chords replaced with a frog's, and honestly I can't think of a finer way to describe it.\n\n  Then the clean vocals start and made me want to stop listening altogether.  On AVE, the clean vocals were well planned, strong, and worked to perfection.  I honestly don't know what to think about them on this album (see example the title track...), but they seem out of place (and in the wrong genre).  I definitely would consider them a crummy move.\n\n  Lest you think the shift in vocal style is my only reason for giving this album a 2\/5 (I would rather have given it a 1.5, but that's not possible so...), rest assured I have more problems with it.  The melodies and synth lines are dull and repetitive, sounding like slightly harsher cookie-cutter riffs from some dance track.  The music itself seems to have lost most of its edge, just like the vocals.\n\n  Overall, when listening to this album I continually get the sense that the songs are arduous so hard to be as dark, aggressive, and energetic as the cover art would suggest, but in the end they just fall short in every way.  If I had to pick a cherished track, it would probably be 'The Devil's in the Details', as it reminds me of 'Spit It Out', the opening track from AVE.  Honestly, if you're a fan of AP, be prepared for a failure, and if you're not a fan (yet) I strongly urge you to start with AVE or the first album Close to Human.

Gloria might be reaching out for the younger generations, but she is definitely losing some of her old fans. So, let's wait and see how the album does on the market.

The sound is distinguished, as is the orchestral work (listen, for example, to the growling lower strings at the end of the first movement of K. 491). There are also some rather interesting cadenzas here, paricularly Faure's fascinating (if anachronistic) cadenza in K. 491. The booklet notes are fine. The author points to the dramatic operatic qualities of the works, paricularly the aria-like quality of the slow movements. And these are the qualities missing from these neat, prettified performances. A friend of mine once aptly observed that Mozart pianissimos should never sound like Chopin's, which is precisely what Primakov's soft-focused playing suggests. To my ears the softness of his touch combined with a reluctance to play any one thing above a piano produces deadly results. I started with K. 491, and the first movement went reasonably well.  The trouble began with the slow movement, played at a somewhat slow tempo (no dilemma) and at exactly the same muted dynamic level throughout. It appeared like cocktail music to me. The finale was also slow and also lacking in drama. The alluring dialogue for piano and oboe made almost no impression because it appeared just like everythinjg else in the movement. For comparison, I turned to Richard Good's distinguished performance with Orpheus. What a contrast Goode's clear, focused sound was to Primakov's dreamy tinkling. Still, this performance was superior to that of K. 503.  Once again, the opening movenment was satisfactory.  But the last two movements were harrowing. The slow movement is \"dreamy,\" the trills barely audible, and any operatic quality entirely lost. The finale was dreadfully dull, with Primakov playing one passage after another without the slightest sparkle or drama. I was disheartened, but I went on and found the last two concertos equally sweet, pretty, and mundane. Judging from the distinguished criticisms this release has received it seems that many people like their Mozart played this way. For such listeners, the present release can be safely recommended, for Primakov's playing is unfailingly \"alluring.\" But if you like your Mozart played with passion and drama, you should go elsewhere.","3526":"I saw The Still Voice at the anti-pop music festival years ago in Orlando and was hooked. They made a few other appearances locally and put out an EP a bit prior to this album, but sadly split up soon after. The music is fuzzy, rocky, trip-hoppy, complex, and occasionally reminiscent of the Kidney Thieves (perchance with a somewhat grittier texture). Erin Solari is a First-rate vocalist, and I'm hoping her upcoming solo project picks up where this album left off.","3527":"I just really like this song.","3528":"I acquired the CD and it arrived at my house quickly, but the case was damp and the colours were distorted.\nI honestly do not want to acquire another $17 dollar CD, but I will. Because I don't want the CD case looking this crummy.\nThe CD is absolutely fine but I don't want the case to look this ghastly.","3529":"Wow, this song is really inspiring and can really help one rock out during a workout!\nThe song\/album cover, well....I wonder if this guy gets any chicks - I mean what's up with the stained shirt? I bet as a day job this guy is a lawyer or analyst or something - he is definately good looking!\nRegardless, the song is First-rate - I just hope there are more to come, perchance a video?!?\nAcquire this song, you won't be unhappy!","3530":"i acquired this item from a company in Lancashire, England, to be shipped all the way to America and it arrived in less days than expected. i was very pleased for it to have exceeded my expectations, both service and pure delight for the songs. they're all very upbeat tracks, with memorable tunes. i loved them all. when the package arrived, the disc was in mint condition and ready to play. i played the CD almost everyday since i got it. i am a big fan of The Wanted to i hope to get the next CD that they come out with. i always look forward to their new tracks. these guys are truly gifted singers and deserve all the recognition in the world. definitely worth purchasing if you are interested in their music. its a promising CD. my beloved are probably Glad You Came, Warzone, Last To Know, Rocket, Lie to Me, and Gold Forever. though i do like them all, its really hard to single any out. though i must say, Invincible is sort of repetitive.\nacquire this, you won't be disconcerted.","3531":"I adore \"trouble so hard\" in the original folk version or the Moby version as Natural Blues.  This music bears no relation to the song I can see... a bunch of hissing turntable flipping, no song, no melody.  If you want some techno club music that just sounds generic and unidentifiable, it's FINE.  I didn't.  After nothing transpired for 3 minutes I fast forwarded through it, nothing ever transpired as far as I heard.  I wasted $1.59.  The only time I have acquired something on Amazon that was nothing like I expected.\n\nIf you know the performers and what they do, perchance you'll adore it.  If you want the title song, you won't.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFINE, I missed it.  The vocal from \"Trouble So Hard\" starts at 3:26 and runs more or less straight until about 4:17, then resurfaces garbled until about 4:27, then is there under the overlay of club music to about 6:00.  So about 1\/4 of the track has apparently a copy of Vera Hall's recording of \"trouble so hard\" in it.  After listening to it a half dozen times, it's sort of growing on me..but I start at 3:26.  I'd still much rather have a straight recording of \"trouble so hard\" rather of some of the song wrapped over around and under with club music, but since the sample piece was club music, it's my fault.  Anyway, that's what you get!","3532":"I grew up hearing these old tunes sung by my mother, aunts and uncles.  They're all gone now, but the songs live on.  It is nice to hear new renditions of tunes like this.  It deliver back many fond recollections.  If you enjoy the pop music style of the 20s and 30s, you will like this recording.\n\nBrava, Miss Rose!","3533":"At last there is a decent recording available of Bernard Herrmann's masterpiece: Moby Dick. It's been a long time coming but it is well worth the wait.\n\nThe singers chosen for the solo parts (Ishmael\/Ahab) are supremely skilled (a requirement for this work). But they also add a strong stamp of character, making the music vividly alive. We can sympathize with Ishmael's wonder and amazement; we shiver with horror and awe at Ahab's ravings; and the tragic role of Starbuck deliver tears to our eyes with its stunning pathos. This isn't just a recording - it is a performance. An distinguished program of a very difficult piece of music. You will have a new respect for Bernard Herrmann after listening to this.\n\nThis reviewer has the opportunity to study the original score in the Herrmann archives at Santa Barbara. This is not an accessible piece to play and demands a high quality of player and conductor. The Danish National Orchestra and Choir more than meet those requirements. Under the leadership of conductor Schonwandt, the ensemble delivers an electrifying rendition that holds you spellbound through the entire work. This is not a dull, run of the mill product. Not in the least.\n\nThe quality of the recording is just as stunning as the performance: the sounds are clear, forceful, and well defined. It is a pleasure to listen to at all levels.\n\nBy all means, if you are a fan of Herrmann's film scores, don't miss this opportunity to hear one of his best off-screen creations. It is a shame that we had to wait more than 36 years after the composer's death to hear it - but it is well worth the wait.","3534":"Was scratched, a shame because the music is good.\nI should have known finer to acquire a vinyl!!!","3535":"I like Scotty McCreery and was happy when he won American Idol. I acquired this CD expecting to hear more good songs  from Scotty, nontheless it was a big failure. The song selection was  repetitive, with no outstanding cuts on the CD, and Scotty's singing was the same....mundane. Purchasing this CD was a misuse of cash\/","3536":"I absolutely adore this.  Not your typical cookie cutter pop song.  Siobhan sings from the heart with alot of emotion and you can tell this song is very personal to her.  She has such an unreal voice.  This is Siobhan's homage to Edward Gorey, a Cape Cod writer and illustrator of whimsically macabre books.\n\nShe's releasing her full album on Oct. 30th. I can't wait.  You can check out her music video for Black Doll on her youtube channel 'SioMag'.","3537":"I grabbed this low-cost FLAC intro to Buckethead on a whim and am glad I did.  These cuts probably only appeal to scorching guitar enthusiasts, but they are lively listening.  I particularly like the second slice \"Look Up There\" for the slow build up.  To my ear the solo sounds like an extended version of Jimi Hendrix's magnum opus rendition of Bob Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\".  The first slice is also good but doesn't have the full 20-minute build.","3538":"I adore country but this is just ghastly!!!!!$$$$% I mean who would want this is it just ghastly!!!! Omg its just so crummy!!!!","3539":"Alluring music.  My dad loved this gift.  We acquired more of Alain's music.  Great price on Amazon!","3540":"This is the second disc of the 4-CD Sensual Classics by George Mann that I've reviewed and, as before, it's an uneven collection.  While he get's a couple of the pieces spot on (more than on Disc 3), mostly the performances are lacking in emotion or flawed.  If you're not expecting much considering the price, you may not be disconcerted.  Schumann's Romance:  you don't feel Schumann's romance for Clara Wieck, his soon-to-be bride, for whom this piece was likely written.  Poulenc's Les chemins d'amour:  pleasant, but lacking in charm.  Beethoven's Adagio cantabile from Pathtique Sonata:  this is described as a grand expansive movement.  While the performance has its moments, it lacks grandness or expansiveness.  The approach is mostly lacking in heart.  Puccini's Doretta's Dream from La Rondine:  fails to conveys the notion of true adore & passion.  Tchaikovsky's None but the Lonely Heart:  lacks the depth of melancholy this song is known for.  Grieg's The Last Spring from Two Elegaic:  lacks the heartbreak on seeing the season of rebirth colored by the possibility that the viewer may not live to see another.  Massennet's Elegie:  strikes the right note here.  Mascagni's Intermezzo from Cavelleria rusticana:  alluring serene piece played too heavy handed.  Chopin's Prelude No. 15 in D-Flat Major:  low notes lack clarity.  Piano almost sounds like an organ.  Brahm's Waltz in A-flat Major, Op. 39, No. 15:  FINE, has some dance-like rhythm to it.  Rachmoninoff's Variation No. 18 from Rhapsody on a Theme from Paginini:  best slice on CD.  Bizet's Habaera from Carmen:  FINE.  Has some rhythm and variety of touch.  Ravel's Pavane for a Dead Princess:  fine.  Mozart's Romanze from Andante from Eine kleine Nachtmuzik:  lacking in Viennese suavity.  Satie's Lent et douloureaux from Trois Gymnopedies:  appropriately dreamy.","3541":"Only one song on this CD and the lowest I have ever heard.\nMy Canary is NOT sing with this CD playing.","3542":"I agree with some of the preceding criticisms- this arrangement is simply my cherished version of Carol of the Bells ever released.  I absolutely adore this song, and don't mind listening to it any time of the year.  Combine this song with \"Santa Will Find You\" and you've got an awe-inspiring Christmas two-fer.  Awe-inspiring work by both Robert Prizeman as well as all of the boys.  Bravo!","3543":"As far as I know, this BDAA 2007 Festival of Russian Music CD, available at Amazon, contains the only commercially available digital recording of Vera Gorodovskaya's exquisite \"At Dawn\" (a.k.a. \"At Dawn, Sweet Dawn\"), which I first heard on the 1970 vinyl stereo album, \"The Fabulous Osipov Balalaika Orchestra,\" Angel\/Melodiya SR-40120 Stereo. That recording was so strikingly alluring that I have been arduous, unsuccessfully so far, to get it digitally reproduced to keep it from disappearing into the limbo of unpreserved and no longer available vinyl recordings. Recently, in another try at a laptop search, I was overjoyed to discover this 2007 digital recording made for the BDAA Festival.  When I played it, I was intially pleased that someone recognized the unique beauty of this piece enough to do a more recent recording of it.  But as the performance progressed, I was horrified to find that someone had added an entirely inappropriate trap drum beat, absolutely ruining the ethereal, poignant, soaring richness of the piece as played by the Osipov orchestra. The composer, Vera Gorodovskaya, was a performer with the Osipov orchestra, which leads me to presume that the Osipov version would be the most authentic - I have no belief how the drum got to be added. I can only hope that, in the future, a new recording will restore the original stunning orchestration and interpretation of the 1970 recording.","3544":"BELAFONTE (LPM-1150), taped by RCA VICTOR in mid-August '55, was Harry's second LP and his follow-up to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/MARK-TWAIN-OTHER-FOLK-BELOVED\/dp\/B0018GFCH6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MARK TWAIN & OTHER FOLK BELOVED<\/a>.

After Harry toured with it for four years, that old \"Ribbons\" take was included on this Billboard-topping LP. The set-closer, \"Sylvie,\" was written by Leadbelly (Huddie Ledbetter). Although he's not credited on the LP, Leadbelly also originated \"Pick a Bale of Cotton.\" (NOTE: One person going all-out could not possibly pick a bale in a single day.)\n\nThe general mood here is one of sadness. Even the few upbeat songs have a worrisome undertone: Matilda absconded with the cash; Noah had to build that ark for a rainy reason; Gettin' Up Mornin' is a date with Judgment Day; Jump Down and sweat a pail of water.\n\n.\nSIDE ONE\n[3:42] Waterboy\n[3:38] Troubles\n[3:19] Suzanne (Every Night When the Sun Goes Down)\n[3:11] Matilda\n[6:00] Take My Mother Home\n\nSIDE TWO\n[4:53] Noah\n[3:13] Scarlet Ribbons (For Her Hair)\n[3:15] In That Great Gettin' Up Mornin'\n[3:18] Unchained Melody\n[1:54] Jump Down Spin Around (Pick a Bale of Cotton)\n[5:21] Sylvie (Bring Me Little Water, Sylvie)\n\nTOTAL TIME: 41:44","3545":"I adore Norton Buffalo and would adore to have this album but there is no way in hell I would spend 10 grand to acquire it when Norton's website sells it for $15.","3546":"A very deep and pondered provoking song, which sometimes is improperly interpreted (in my opinion) as a suicide song. The song is about choosing between standing on the shore of loneliness, desperation, and denial, or giving in and letting yourselves be swept into the depths of passionate adore. And I know from experience that, if you are going to fall in adore, it's far finer fall absolutely in and be swept away...","3547":"Finer Than Ezra is one of my cherished bands, but I'm unhappy, I loathe releases like this one. The intro track is not even a song. The 2nd track a throw away less than 2 minute track not only about a subject of very little interest to me (College Football), but about a specific team in a geographic region very far from mine. The third track at less than 3 minutes is more like a commercial jingle than a song. The 4th track a country cover that nods at the previously mentioned college football team. Then, finally a decent track \"Hey Baby\" after half the record is over. \"This Time Of Year\" you already acquired on the Greatest Hits release. \"Hell No\" you already acquired on the Paper Empire release. The last track which is by far the lamest tribute to the college team of interest includes a puke inducing rap. I know the band is pandering to their hometown, but for other fans, this is an insulting release. If you're content to being a college bar band, keep putting out stuff like this.\n\nDownload Hey Baby, and leave the rest.","3548":"GOOFY GREATS was released in 1975 by KTEL. It's junk. Mosst of the songs have been heavily edited. The sound quality is very meager. They attempted to put 12 songs on each side which doesn't help. The LP first sold for around $4.99.

I fathom if you are into Halloween music it would be fine - perchance.","3551":"We discovered Lila Downs' music when we were in Baja, can't remember how, but once we caught that voice we were drawn to it and never moved far from it. We acquired her CDs and played them in the RV as we drove to the furthest reaches away from Gringolandia those alluring three months, camping at Playa San Pedrito south of Todos Santos, and many other magical loving places. She serenaded us everywhere, & all up that east coast of Baja above La Paz, among the Mejicanos and cuervos y mar y aire tan dulce. And we don't even speak Spanish, we just sorta picked it up from her soul of song putting us in the mood to understand more deeply the ancient Mexican spirit. Her singing goes right in your chest up to the wrist and squeezes hard, and it feels like you're being drawn out into a realer life. Growing up in Santa Fe as kids we 'd sneak out & spend a lot of time at night sitting along the Santa Fe river listening to the mariachi music from the cantinas nearby, and the best of the singers were the old gals with the gutsy bitter and brave voices lamenting lost beauty and passion...Lila learned from some of them, perchance not from Santa Fe, but Mexican sisters, and listening to her took me right back to the summer evenings sitting with my brothers by the river listening through the open doors of the bars... Florinda Anaya looked after us kids sometimes back then in the 40's and she'd sometime take us to the Boys Club onLower  Agua Fria and belt out songs like Lila sings... and she too could turn into a cantadora vieja and sing those songs of lost lust and adore, even though she was only 18. Makes me sob a little just thinking about it. Thanks Lila!!!!!\n\nJack Underhill\n [...]","3552":"A few months ago I acquired this CD from an Amazon third party seller. The sound was not up the preceding recordings I own by Lilia Downs, and the artwork and printing was blurred.  When I looked closely, the copyright said this CD had been made in Argentina. I was in Lima, Peru last year visiting relatives and was shocked to see that virtually every CD store was filled with recordings that had grainy reproductions of cover art, illegibly blurred printing; and burned on CD-R media. Either they are bootlegs, or the manufacturing standards for CDs are far lower than in the US and Europe. I think it would be very helpful if people would comment on the quality of the packaging and the sound quality of any CDs they purchase, particularly from Amazon third party sellers. This will not only help others know what sellers provide the quality we expect, but might even help artists get the royalties they are due.","3553":"Low quality FLAC's. Don't acquire this download, acquire a CD or LP of this. The FLAC's sound harrowing and I couldn't get any help from the label on getting finer ones.","3554":"I loved 28 Orange Street and The Big Fear. Then Isalie came out, and it was so lifeless and dull it seemed written by a different band. I had hoped the boys' interest in pulse-free, hook-free folk tunes was a temporary glitch, but alas, it seems like the new norm. The guys who wrote the folksy bounce of Burgundy and the faux-rocker Indie Rockin' are nowhere to be seen on this collection. Rather, it's more sedate and opaque songwriting, performed with no energy or drive. There's barely any one thing here that would count as mid-tempo, to say nothing of upbeat.\n\nLike Isalie, I listened to this three or four times, and I couldn't tell you any one thing about any of the songs, and that makes me bitter. Hopefully the upcoming collaboration with Dan Bern will be a return to form; until then, you're finer off spinning the Big Fear again and dreaming.","3555":"I don't understand why the format had to change.  I've acquired music from Amazon before and had no problems.  Since they started with the 'cloud' application, I have problems downloading music to my laptop in FLAC format, or at all for that matter.  After several attempts, I had to contact Amazon and get a refund for music acquired but never received.  Unfortunate though, because it was really convenient - at first.","3556":"I pondered Country Feedback was a good song to begin with, but this version sends it flying into the atmosphere. The introduction lasts over 2 minutes while Neil Young rocks out on acoustic guitar. The final coda of Stipe singing \"It's crazy what you could have had\/I need this!\" has him hitting his highest note that I can ever remember, and holding that final \"need\" for almost 14 seconds. Just astonishing, and the song still had 2 and a half minutes left.

In each case there remained a kind of \"wooliness\" to the sound picture which prevented me from appreciating the beauty of the solo voices  and chorus - which seemed hard and too deeply buried in the fabric of the sound picture - with the result that the New Philharmonia Chorus and Orchestra never seemed fully focused ..at least through my stereo and home entertainment systems.\n\nThus it was with some uneasiness  that I plunked down almost $50 for this Japanese SACD pressing, which has been around for awhile. I would have done so sooner but I kept hoping EMI would release it as one of its very inexpensive DSD SACD sets of Klemperer material (Mozart symphonies, etc.) which became available domestically in 2012.  In any event  now that I've previewed this SACD pressing my impression is that it may be slightly but not dramatically finer than the 2001 CD.  The general sound picture is very similar to that of the earlier CD.  There may or may not be a greater sense of solidity to the image.  My fathom is that recent re-mastering processes were not used to upgrade the master tape transfer from its 2001 incarnation so that it was still this 2001 tape that was transferred via SACD to the CD disc.  Solo voices remained slightly \"hard\" and were still somewhat lost in the orchestral sound picture.\nGiven this, the question then becomes one of  whether this slight possible improvement is worth the extra $$$$.  At best I'd call it a close call.\n\nADDENDUM:  I've just determined that this Japanese pressing is probably not a SACD at all, which would explain its very small sonic differences with my earlier \"Great Recordings of the Century\" CD that I'd used for comparisons.  MY CD\/SACD\/DVD\/BluRay player has a screen feature in which each disc being played is identified by type (either \"CDDA\" for conventional CDs or \"SACD PCM\". When I checked this Japanese pressing it read  \"CDDA Stereo 44.1K 16B\" which is the same reading I get for my conventional American \"Great Recordings of  the Century\" CD.  Furthermore, nowhere is the Japanese disc identified as \"SACD\" = with SONY's SACD and DSD trademarks in English....Only that it is in \"stereo\".  I've contacted the distributor to call this to their attention and identified two possibilities 1) that they'd mistakenly sent me the wrong pressing, or 2) that they've mis-advertised the type of CD on Amazon...which would lead to more serious consequences.  I've not yet heard from them, and if I don't within the next few days I will contact Amazon to press this complaint for their action.","3559":"I'm rating the FLAC quality, not the tune itself. As if you're here, you probably already know Satie's Gymnopdie No. 1 is awe-inspiring.\n\nI've acquired hundreds of classical works off Amazon and the sound quality of this one in comparison is just abhorrent. Even if I turn the treble all the way up on my stereo, it still sounds very muffled and not crisp at all.

I adore Iron Maiden and was hoping to be able to pass on my adore of their music in a way that's gentle to young ears. I wanted to like this album, but couldn't.\n\nThe concept is First-rate, but the execution is very meager with the stereotypical and unimaginative arrangement of xylophone\/marimba percussion and childish music box sounds. Many of the songs are unrecognizable. Most bothersome are the sleighbells. They feature prominently in EVERY single one of the songs. Really? Is this Christmas versions of Iron Maiden or did I read the title wrong? How about some soft guitar or violins, or any one thing else for that matter?\n\nIt's a real insult to the musical genius of the band, one of the most creative and influential bands of our time. They could've done so much with the source material, but rather chose to make a bland, uninspired, and gutless low-fidelity experience. The lack of enjoy to the source material extends down to the cover, which looks like a crummy Halloween party poster. They couldn't done a clever child-friendly take on one of Iron Maiden's album art. You can listen for yourself to the samples provided by Amazon and make your own decision. If you have Amazon Prime, you can listen to the full album on your mobile app for free.\n\nUp the Irons.

KT was featured in a very limited part of the game, nontheless, just that tidbit was enough to change my perspective on music for ever.

KT opened my eyes to a whole new world of music that I hadn't even known exisited...to date I haven't heard a single track that I can honestly say, \"eh its okay\". Every single song is its own. Thank you KT for making music that kicks A$$ on every level from the words, the depth, melody, everything. I supremely recommned that you give these tracks and all other KT work(to include Free Dominguez's solo work) a good thorough listen.","3563":"This album, LaRoche's debut, has since been republished and can be found here:\nAlbum: FLAC & CD *&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Secrets-of-a-Soul\/dp\/B006TC309Q\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Secrets of a Soul<\/a>\n01Track Katabatic Passions *&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Katabatic-Passions\/dp\/B006TC30P0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Katabatic Passions<\/a>\n02Track Darkness Falls *&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Darkness-Falls\/dp\/B006TC314A\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Darkness Falls<\/a>\n03Track Arabesque *&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Arabesque\/dp\/B006TC31XQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Arabesque<\/a>\n04Track Ephemeral Eternity *&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ephemeral-Eternity\/dp\/B006TC33RU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ephemeral Eternity<\/a>\n05Track Time Before Time *&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Time-Before-Time\/dp\/B006TC34E2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Time Before Time<\/a>\n06Track You Are My Universe *&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/You-Are-My-Universe\/dp\/B006TC34XS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">You Are My Universe<\/a>\n07Track Let Ring Nite Skye *&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Let-Ring-Nite-Skye\/dp\/B006TC35CS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Let Ring Nite Skye<\/a>\n08Track The Yielding of a Muse *&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Yielding-of-a-Muse\/dp\/B006TC35OQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Yielding of a Muse<\/a>\n09Track First Light *&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/First-Light\/dp\/B006TC366S\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">First Light<\/a>\n10Track The Nearness of Her * http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006TC36O0\n11TrackHeaven Hewed of Jewels * http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006TC372G\n\nIt's composed of songs that are elemental and joyous, evoking strong images with exceptional musicality, where musical vistas actually come into view, vary and evolve in an orderly progression rather than the endless meandering as is too often the case elsewhere in this genre.\nGood new age music is simply jazz in another guise - possibly slightly more focused on the melodic rather than the harmonic content.\nLaRoche has a real touch and style that captivates the listener and always impacts the emotions. It doesn't try to overwhelm, but reaches for a fine emotional balance to carry listeners on a personal journey through rich landscapes of pure emotion.\nThis is truly gorgeous solo piano record of extraordinary recording quality.\nYou can hear chords echo off of canyon walls and hear the quite of a summer's field. The grandeur of the wide open big sky plains above are ended only by the curvature of the earth below, with lyrical, trickling sounds of coursing streams conjured across such alluring sounds of grandeur and serenity.\n\nIt all shows in LaRoche's careful crafting and ability to vary his style and choice of tonalities. The dynamics are very subtle, even missed a few times until you notice them. Soothing, melodic and dextrous playing that set's this album apart as something very special indeed.","3564":"X5 has done it again. They have issued a mix of old, re-hashed material from other collections in their \"99\" series and new classical music that is pretty interesting -- at least interesting enough to draw me in at the bargain price as the FLAC Daily Deal on October 14, 2011.\n\nThis is almost all distinguished music in good to very good performances. If you haven't acquired a lot of these collections previously, it is a no-brainer at the special price.\n\nSome number crunching. Based on my own collection -- these numbers may be much smaller or a little larger for you depending on what you've acquired from these sets in the past -- 52 of the 99 tracks here have been released on preceding \"99\" sets by X5. A further four tracks are music that has been featured before, but are here in different performances. The remaining 43 tracks are music new to the series.\n\nAmong the music that has been featured before are a lot of classical music \"greatest hits\" -- some of the most famous Beethoven piano sonatas, Schubert's Rosamunde string quartet, Brahms' 3rd Symphony, and a good smattering of Mozart, for example.\n\nWithin the set of new music, a few things stood out and tipped me over the edge on the decision to acquire. Most important was the inclusion of Charles Ives' Violin Sonata No. 2, played by Sweden's Karl-Ove Mannberg and Lena Johnson. X5 is pretty savvy when it comes to capitalizing on what's going on in the classical world, so I imagine they included this because violin superstar Hilary Hahn has just released&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/her-own-distinguished-album-of-the-Ives-sonatas\/dp\/B005DWX9YO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">her own distinguished album of the Ives sonatas<\/a>. I was glad to hear the Mannberg\/Johnson performance, but I can't say it's my cherished.\n\nAnother highlight among the new stuff is the Four Sea Interludes from Peter Grimes by Benjamin Britten, performed under conductor Neeme Jarvi. These are great pieces, although the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/performances-by-Leonard-Bernstein-in-the-last-concert-before-his-death\/dp\/B000001GEY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">performances by Leonard Bernstein in the last concert before his death<\/a>&nbsp;remain my cherished.\n\nFinally, there are a range of modern tracks by Scandinavian, German and Japanese composers that I found of interest -- pieces by Masakazu Natsuda, Klaus Jckle, Carin Malmlf-Forssling, Pehr Henrik Nordgren, Dag Wirn, Kalevi Aho, Markus Zahnhausen, Erna Tauro, Einojuhani Rautavaara, and Yoshinao Nakada are all well off the beaten path and I was more than happy to pay a couple of bucks to hear this new-to-me music. I can't promise that you'll adore all of it -- I didn't either -- but hearing new things is welcome.\n\nTotal download size is 938 MB. Bitrates are variable and average 159-240 kbps.\n\nRecommended for anyone at the Daily Deal price. There is a lot of great music here.\n\nNote that it is no longer possible to see who the composers are on the individual tracks, even when you click on the individual songs.

Fortunately, that's not a crummy thing. I presume it's a remake of a 50's Sinatra magnum opus. The group imulates that era very well, is so smooth and blend so well, you can't help from getting into a festive mood. The chorus is now my wife's ringtone. She adores it.","3566":"One of my fave albums.  A fine magnum opus band. Great tunes. Distinguished performances and a lovely in your living room feel. I miss these guys.","3567":"Not funny.  I just did not find it funny at all.","3568":"I adore toccata and fugue but when I acquired this particular one, the little preview clip they let you listen too was deceiving: not only is the song a lot shorter than I remember, it's also REALLY fast. That was my dilemma with it; if only you could slow it down do that one could actually hear the song and recognize its distinctive and often pretty parts. This version goes so fast that the song is utterly ruined and almost all enjoyment of it is destroyed. I gave it a 2 star rating becsuse it isn't entire junk:; and I'll still listen to it, but I'll also loathe looking at that ugly cover art that's for sure.","3569":"Inferior sound when played back on my iPod.

They have brought back such fine recollections. God, I miss him! I can't say any one thing crummy about his music or his movies. There will never be another performer like him. This song sounds exactly the way I remembered it, I just couldn't get enough of it. I could play it over and over again, just wish the songs were longer then I wouldn't have to keep replaying ha ha! The quality is great and they sound so good it makes me now, want to acquire all his movies! If you adore Elvis and you have recollections then you will adore his music & movies.

It sounds astonishing! As far as the music, Chad told me that they pull a lot of influence from Rush and prog. bands of the like, but I also hear a space rock sound, like from some of the Cave In CDs.

This album rules. I have had it on repeat since I acquired it and I share the song B.U.S.T. with everyone. So far in my absolutely unorthodox and informal survey it has been a unanimous hit.

Sensitively and masterfully sung.","3581":"Only 13 criticisms?!?!?!  How is this possible?  Did fans miss the memo?\n\nThis is clearly and unarguably Jon's best work since Yes' Magnification in 2001.  And I would go as far as to say his best solo work ever.  Jon has tapped into something very special with this piece of music.  His spirituality is forefront (as it always is) except now it is delivered by a man who is sure of who he is and the world around him, spiritually.  He has definitely evolved and 'arrived'.  The music is First-rate - developed, well-orchestrated, and filled with depth.\n\nSo why 4 stars?  Honestly?  Because as much as I adore listening to \"Open\" (and I do, I listen to it often), I am often reminded of just how much MORE this song could have been had it been recorded with YES with a symphony orchestra like Magnification.  I miss full drums (not just percussion), Steve's guitar work, and obviously Chris' bass work.  Had \"Open\" been recorded wtih YES-proper, I don't think it would be an understatement to then rank it right along side of Close To The Edge, Gates Of Delerium, and Awaken because the playing that Steve, Chris and Alan would have brought to the table would have elevated this song into the stratosphere.\n\nBut regardless, this is still an inspiring and very fulfilling piece of music that will resonate and travel with me for the rest of my life.\n\nThank you Jon!!!!  Now do it again!!!!!!!

Taken as entire wholes, none of the three is outstanding, though there are individual movements within them that are very forceful.\n\nThe \"Mishima\" quartet is actually an adaptation for saxophones of a work Glass originally wrote for strings, part of the soundtrack for the movie Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters. Many critics, myself included, often excoriate Glass for the lack of harmonic development in his pieces. Here, nontheless, his stylistic signature does not severely detract from the pieces' sense of forward motion; each belief is repeated, true, but not so many times as to become tiresome. They all share a tone of brooding mixed with quiet menace that is quite striking. It helps that they are short pieces; none of the six movements is longer than three and a half minutes, and the second and fourth are barely more than a minute each.\n\nI've been listening to the string version of \"Mishima\" for comparison, and I think it actually comes off slightly finer on the saxophones. The constant eighth-note pulses that are so characteristic of Glass seem somehow more live played on winds, as do the ascending arpeggios. The performers do an distinguished job of giving different emphases to each note in a phrase, making the smallest variation truly stand out. The string version, by contrast, has a certain homogeneity that renders the pieces more emotionally distant.\n\nThe next work, also by Glass, is simply entitled \"Saxophone Quartet,\" and it is a somewhat strangely organized four-movement piece. The first movement is bitter and minor. The main melody carried on the soprano sax is lyrical enough, but the accompaniment is generally uninspired. As a longer work, around four and a half minutes, it does suffer from a bit of that Glassian repetitiveness, as certain segments are heard several times without adding any one thing to the musical or emotional impact on the listener. The second movement is considerably more energetic and daring (part of the reason why the overall organization of the movements is confusing); it evokes imagery of scaling a great but precarious height, the excitement and tension building and building until a final explosion of melodic energy sends it all tumbling down. The ensemble works together more effectively here; rather than one instrument having the melody while the others play repeating patterns, there is a great deal of trading back and forth, and phrases of forceful homophony as well, particularly towards the end. Regrettably, the third movement is both the longest and the dullest. It has neither the excitement of the second nor the lyricism of the first. Glass also returns to a much more straightforward arranging technique for much of the movement, with each of the players getting their turn having the primary melody, while the others play the same old interlocking pulse pattern. There is a new melodic belief introduced briefly about three-quarters of the way through, but then it disappointingly leads to nothing more than one more time through the main theme.\n\nLuckily, the fourth movement makes up for the flaws in the rest of the longer work, and then some. It is astonishing, probably my single cherished piece by Glass. The stuttering, syncopated rhythmic motive is inseparable from the driving melodic line, that here undergoes actual transformation and development as the piece goes on. The melodic statements are interspersed with swirling loops and turns in a new register and instrument, and these transitions are organic, vital, and varied. Because this movement has some actual structure and meaningful form to it, the restatement of the main theme, when it occurs, feels like an actual arrival, not simply another repetition. The climax features some striking dynamic changes, with sudden quiet moments that are in turn overwhelmed by storms of very fast runs on the bari sax, all leading to a strong and explosive conclusion that hits like a ton of bricks. Why can't Glass write more pieces that are this well put together?\n\nMichael Nyman's collection \"Songs for Tony,\" also a four-movement work, begins very promisingly. In the first movement, Nyman sets up a forceful, swift-moving minor mode riff that juxtaposes the high and low registers of the ensemble. The energy of the original hook never relents, but the melody that emerges and is carried primarily by the tenor sax is surprisingly sensitive and touching. The warm, Renaissance-like concluding cadence is a nice touch as well.\n\nThe other three movements, regrettably, never attain the same vitality as the first. They tread by-now familiar sax quartet territory, with melodies and harmonies that are at best clichd and at lowest simply plodding. The third movement's main theme is memorable, even catchy, but the transformations it undergoes are unconvincing and ultimately not very, well, transformative. While in the fourth movement, Nyman aims for real subtlety with an extremely quiet main melody in the bari sax, that is only lightly accompanied. The patience required to wait while the piece slowly builds is not rewarded by any one thing particularly revelatory, nontheless, only more of the same, with an inconclusive, anemic ending that feels more like someone simply shut off the mikes in the studio, rather than a real conclusion.\n\nSpeaking of microphones and studios... as someone whose main training is in composition, most of my thinking when I hear a new album goes towards the architecture of the pieces and the like, but of course there are purely production-oriented considerations to take into account as well. The truth is, while the album's performances didn't detract from my enjoyment of the pieces, neither did they enhance it. Although both the playing and the engineering are smooth and competent, with even very subtle key-clicks and the like rendered expertly and audibly, there is a slight lack of crispness to some of the articulations that make already slow pieces bog down a bit. The exception, as noted above, is the rendering of the alluring main melody of the first movement of \"Songs For Tony.\" Which deliver me back around full circle, and leads me to conclude that the performances were really dictated by the strengths and weaknesses of the compositions--but that could just be my personal bias.\n\nThe Sonic Art Quartet's album is, overall, pleasant but uneven. The second and third works presented have alluring moments, but in most of the cases there is too much dead air between them to allow the music as a whole to come alive. For fans of the original version of the \"Mishima\" quartet, the reworking for saxophones is worth hearing, and the strongest movements of each of the two other offerings deserve to be entered into the canon of literature for the sax quartet. But there is a great deal of skippable material here as well, and all but the most completionist of listeners will want to acquire individual tracks rather than the whole thing.\n\n-\n\nMatt Weber is a New York based composer, educator, and political slacktivist.\n\nOriginally published on ICareIfYouListen.com","3592":"Fans of modern music looking for something new should give a listen to the Sonic Art Saxophone Quartet, which sounds like nothing else on the alt-classical landscape. The four members of this tight little outfit conjure an astonishing range of tonalities and timbres, far beyond what one might consider possible on the saxophone. The unusual instrumentation proves particularly apt for adventurous composers like Philip Glass and Michael Nyman, who are featured on this disc. The group's forceful yet supple sound perfectly evokes Nyman's poignant lyricism and the nervous intensity of Glass' passive-aggressive sonic structures. Intricate, alluring and hypnotic, this music will take the listener on unexpected and joyous journeys.","3593":"Clyde Gilmour's show was fine because you never knew what you were going to hear next.  He might start with Mozart, followed by an operatic piece and then a track from a spoken word recording.  After that you could locomotive sounds, jazz, or perchance a comedy piece.  There was always insightful commentary as well.  I'll always recall hearing all or part of his weekly show when we would return from Church.  There are few if any shows like this today.  We now have programs and even entire channels devoted to very specific genres.  But Gilmour's Albums did not exist in the era of hundreds of channels or the Internet.  You had far fewer choices then, so variety shows were very practical.  This CD captures some of the hosts favourite pieces along with his own words.  Theme music from the show is included.","3594":"Dear Amazon:\n\nI want a CD version of this album for the following reasons:\n\n1. BIGGEST REASON: When I download the FLAC version to my PC I make a backup using a blank CD. Nontheless when I do this and move it to another PC or other device all the tracks show up as track 1, track 2 etc. So I have to go and label all the tracks so I know which one is which. Lowest of all there is no picture of the album when I put it into Windows Media player. Yes I actually enjoy that the picture is not there. I know Windows Media player can try and find the picture online but it almost always doesn't find the right one. This is why I want the CD version so crummy.\n\n2. When I rip a CD to my laptop i want to be able to choose the format it gets ripped in.(FLAC, wma, FLAC and so on).\n3. CD has finer audio quality than the FLAC version\n4. I have to install software from amazon that is solely used for downloading the music and I don't like that.\n5. If there was a CD version I would have acquired this already.\n\nSo please, do whatever you got to do to get me a CD version of this available on your website. please do it and I will most definitely acquire it. I prefer all my music to come from it's purest source. the CD. I don't enjoy if it costs a bit more I'm totally fine with that. If you can't do this than please tell me where I can get the CD version. (If there is one)If there isn't then have whoever makes this make CD versions.","3595":"I'm a fan of Reich, but I never liked the Triple Concerto and found Different Trains to be a bit taxing, though the first part of its three has held my interest over the years.  Here, the Triple Quartet sounds harsh.  Now, harshness is a quality that might actually be a great addition to Different Trains considering the subject matter.  In this particular instance, that harshness continues but somehow the sound lacks depth.  I don't hear the trains in the music as I do on the version from the Different Trains\/Electric Counterpoint album.  Perchance I'm just partial to the versions I heard originally and new ones just don't compare.\n\nIn any case, the whole point of my criticism is the stunning Piano Counterpoint.  This piece is new to me and this might be the only place where it's been recorded.  Vincent Corver's arrangement deliver tremendous life to Reich's style.  It's as if he really \"gets\" Reich.  Dare I say he might have even improved on it?  This is a lively, happy, well-played and enjoyable piece and out of character with the rest of the music on this album.  Because you can acquire each track individually, I opted to acquire just this one and I'm very happy to hear it bouncing off my walls.  If you're a Reich fan, don't miss this stunning track.  2 stars for the album, 5 stars for Piano Counterpoint.","3596":"GLMET is a all female Japanese melodic death metal band, I've also seen they like to say they are \"Moe\" (probably spelt wrong) for cute death metal.

But the music video isn't on a separate disc, its in the regular cd, and if you want to put it on IPhones, tablets etc. you can just open up the CD on your laptop and drag and drop the file to desktop.

This is his second album as leader and is on the renown Blue Note Label. Arduous to find this on vinyl is all but impossible. But thankfully Blue Note finally found the lost tapes and reissued this on vinyl sometime back.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1  Good Old Soul\n2  Up Tight's Creek\n3  Theme For Doris\n4  True Blue\n5  Miss Hazel\n6  Nothing Ever Changes My Adore For You\n\nThe Sextet:\n\nTina Brooks - Tenor Sax\nFreddie Hubbard - Trumpet\nDuke Jordan - Piano\nSam Jones - Bass\nArt Taylor - Drums\n\nRecorded 1960 on the Blue Note Label. This reissue carries catalog number 4041.\n\nCriticism:\n\nAs with Minor Move and Back to the Tracks, Tina Brooks' True Blue is an album of hard bop excellence. Recorded in '60, it finds the tenor saxophonist accompanied by Freddie Hubbard on trumpet (a week after Brooks helped Hubbard on his debut album, Open Sesame), Duke Jordan on piano, Sam Jones on bass, and Art Taylor on drums. The six original compositions by Brooks are well-crafted, though none are stellar. The group's cohesive sound, its consistent blues-induced jazz groove, and the numerous well-defined solos are the album's strengths.\n\nYou'd never know it from listening to his distinctive tone and melodic attitude, but Brooks never made it big. Though he recorded four albums for Blue Note, True Blue was the only one that was released during his lifetime. I'll health and drugs eventually took their toll and he passed away in '74 at 42 years of age.\n\nThere is a terrifically pensive blues cry in every Brooks solo on this release that is mesmerizing. While he's often shadowed by trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, the two gracefully bring out some profoundly thoughtful improvising from each other. None of the four tunes (and two alternative takes) are exactly inspiring tunes. But Brooks packs a lot of raw emotionality and innovative musical craft into his solos. Although the liner notes makes much of the Sonny Rollins influence, I actually hear a lot more of a tone I'd connect to Booker Erwin, Ornette Coleman, or Brooks' companion in the Blue Note recording studio, Jackie McLean. Anyone who enjoyed the dramatic support Brooks gave McLean on Jackie's Bag should treasure this, the only album Brooks released under his name as leader during his lifetime. Brooks sounds like a desperately driven musician wanting something beyond the bop of 1960 and never quite making the breakthrough to freedom that McLean found through his association with Ornette Coleman. The rhythm section of drummer Art Taylor, bassist Sam Jones, and pianist Duke Jordan simply never push him that hard to explore new musical territory. I wonder who Brooks would have become had he worked with a drummer like Eddie Blackwell or Elvin Jones.\n\nWhat True Blue gives generously is a full blooded musical portrait of a hard-working and distinctive sounding tenor man with a blue cry stuck in his throat and heart. It is an achievement to treasure.\n\nEnd Criticism:\n\nI could not agree more with the above two criticisms. If you do not have Tina Brooks in your jazz library, you have missed on of the all time greats. While Tina Brooks does not have a large body of work and he ceased recording in 1961, \"True Blue\" remains on of those tour de force recordings to be treasured forever.\n\nView the pics and decide for yourself. This belongs in any jazz library of substance.","3600":"I acquired this app and paid 2.99. It is a good app but it only work for 1 month. I struggled to contact the support but they don't respond.

I love Johnny Cash, and to give anything that he has done less than 4 stars is tough for me. \"Rainbow\" was released in 1985 and was Cash's last album for Columbia. Veteran Memphis producer Chips Moman was given the honors this time around. Chips Moman had produced some incredible R&B hits, as well as bringing Willie Nelson to the masses with \"Always on my Mind.\" And, this pairing does work as well. The material is not weak and not ill-suited for Cash. \"Easy Street\" sounds contrived as Johnny Cash tries to relate to being a millionaire who's having a bad day. PLEEEEZ. On \"Love Me Like You Used To\" Cash dosn't sound as bored singing it as I did listening to it. Not sad. The album has three real good moments though. The opener \"I'm Leaving Now\" is a great lead track that Cash wrote about \"The System\" not a woman. Cut two is Kris Kristofferson's \"Here Comes That Rainbow Again\" which is an uplifting story told well. Cash's cover of CCR's \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain\" stands out also. This was the last digital download I needed to complete my collection. Now you know why.","3617":"Not Awful.

Simply for the fact that it's new music from her and she is not a fantastic singer and artist.  As a stand alone cd, it's not bad.

People get their fixes from different places.  Okay.  So..... \"Keep the Faith\" is a not great song but was already listed on her Christmas album a few years ago.  \"That's God\" is neither well-written nor a radio hit.
