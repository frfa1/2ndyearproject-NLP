"The Oslo ferry is a very beautiful construction and it is amazong how it can transport so many people. The ferry is made out of almost just metal and I have put metal into water and it just sinks straight away, so it is very impressing who it can float all the way to Oslo. It is maybe because they played this song on the ferry that the ride felt like it took two years, because the song was played on repeat the whole way and I had to put on my own headphones as I couldn't handle listening to this song anymore.",negative
