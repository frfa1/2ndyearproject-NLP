{"reviewText":{"0":"My dentist recommended this as a relaxation technique for dental visits. They give me an ipod with headphones, play this on it and it relieves some of the stress of dental treatment, which I dislike intensely.\nIt worked so well that I bought my own copy to try at home. I fall asleep after a couple of minutes and stay asleep. Instead of tossing and turning, I hardly move at all. Highly recommend.","1":"I am personally acquainted with a member of this group and I love his music, but unfortunately, despite his efforts and talent which are not well exhibited herein, are for naught.  The lyrics are often unintelligible, the melodies are boring and repetitious, and the recording quality is marginal.  I am sad because I know these young folks are greatly inspired but it is not demonstrated here.","2":"The Cd cover was broken when I got it","3":"This is an uplifting, keep going, motivating song.  Because the Lord is truly  Big and strong . He is my everything. And I like to share was awesome in the Lord. What isn't. He fills me. Thank you Lord.","4":"I bought this vinyl 2 times and they won't except m,y po box only my physical address! i paid for the shipping 2 different timesand never got the record. they said that my address didn't exist and i had ordered other products and got them delivered to my house no problem this company is a scam and don't have abe products they only steal everything you have bc there the scum of the world!!!","5":"I purchased this album to help me sleep after we had to take the air conditioner out of the window, unfortunately this file only plays 39.55 minutes out of the 105 minutes it's supposed to play, cutting off suddenly and distractingly. I have contacted Amazon regarding this, they made the download available to me again; I followed their instructions clearing my cache, uninstalling their downloader, and restarting my computer, but the file still has the same problem. It's evident that the file they have is just plain corrupt. I've requested a refund, but have heard nothing back. Don't buy this CD!\n\nUPDATE: Amazon refunded my purchase price for this item soon after I had written this review.","6":"good","7":"\"Rainbow\" was a hard album for me to review. I love Johnny Cash, and to give anything that he has done less than 4 stars is tough for me. \"Rainbow\" was released in 1985 and was Cash's last album for Columbia. Veteran Memphis producer Chips Moman was given the honors this time around. Chips Moman had produced some incredible R&B hits, as well as bringing Willie Nelson to the masses with \"Always on my Mind.\" However, this pairing doesn't work as well.  The material is weak and some quite ill-suited for Cash. \"Easy Street\" sounds contrived as Johnny Cash tries to relate to being a millionaire who's having a bad day. PLEEEEZ. On \"Love Me Like You Used To\" Cash sounds as bored singing it as I did listening to it. Sad. The album has three real good moments though. The opener \"I'm Leaving Now\" is a great lead track that Cash wrote about \"The System\" not a woman. Cut two is Kris Kristofferson's \"Here Comes That Rainbow Again\" which is an uplifting story told well. Cash's cover of CCR's \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain\" stands out also. This was the last digital download I needed to complete my collection. Now you know why.","8":"This was the very last original album from Johnny Cash to be released on Columbia records, after you listen to it you'll see why. A few good gems are on this, like his version of the CCR classic \"Have you ever seen the rain?\" but all in all this album is just lame. BUT I will say this......he then signed to Mercury records and made 5....yes 5 totally awesome CDs!  Buy all 5 of those merucry releases......1. Johnny cash is coming to Town....2. Water from the Wells of Home....3. Classic Cash '88 (re-recordings of his big hits)....4. Boom-chicka-Boom.....5. The Mystery of Life.","9":"I thoroughly enjoyed the Battlefield rendition of the series' many games' different themes. Battlefield 2 and Bad Company being the most prominent, the sequences are very well integrated and recording quality is amazing.\n\nThe reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the very long, and very odd section of percussion only, about halfway through the song. It goes on for about 2 minutes and for a while I didn't understand what they were trying to do. I then figured that it was probably their attempt at the Battlefield 3 and 4 theme. But no, it's not. The album came out even before Bad Company 2 did... It doesn't ruin the overall experience entirely, but it was something that bothered me that I thought was worth noting. Otherwise, it's a great piece!","10":"I had the displeasure of listening to this song while listening to Lex and Terry. They had the singer on, Josie, interviewing him and whatnot over the phone, then they played this song. Horrible horrible song. Repetitive, generic, corporate metal? Can I even call it metal? Terrible song.","11":"Michael Buble.  Enough said.","12":"The movie was ok.  The soundtrack is great.  The piano and guitar work are both soulful and invigorating.  Helps keep me going","13":"like this song because different singer is used (bass player) good good good good good and good and good ya","14":"The story itself is great. I have heard it before. But I am extremely disappointed with Amazon's \"download\" service. I thought I would end lp with an MP3 download that I could put on CD and listen to in the card. But instead I get a sort of referral to a website where I can hear the show but I cannot save it to my computer and put it on CD. I specifically downloaded this show to listen to on a trip I will be taking in the car. I will definitely not be buying any more \"downloads\" from Amazon.","15":"This is probably my favorite song these two do.  It was the first one I ever heard, and it is still at the top of my charts.","16":"Beautiful sad, melodic.  An absolutely wonderful tune!","17":"fantastic sound, I love cuban music","18":"Lovely. Juan Diego Florez has a beautiful voice. I heard him first on a PBS segment that highlighted an aria from \"Daughter of the Regiment,\" I think. Wow! Now I'm a fan and love this.","19":"Amazing music on all three albums. New favs.\nI hope enough people listen and enjoy as much as me. Wish they come to Austin Tx.","20":"Sara's album is absolutely, positively, beautiful! (as is she!)\nI love you so much Sara!!! You always have been such an example of Christ's love to me, and to so many people!\nKeep it up sister!\n\n~Brianna Robinson =)","21":"This is a well-done version of a not-quite classic Christmas song. And Then There Were None are Tooth & Nail's loss.","22":"Ipve Amazom","23":"Absolutely FABULOUS!","24":"Purchased as an electronic transfer of one song and this led in turn\nto the creation of my Anazon Cloud Drive.  The Cloud Player is a little\nklunky, but since it is free, how can you complain.","25":"Had the songs I wanted on it","26":"If you love Jo Dee Messina- buy this cd.  Simply for the fact that it's new music from her and she is a fantastic singer and artist.  As a stand alone cd, it's not bad.  Probably the weakest of the \"Unmistakable\" trilogy in my opinion, but still with some good points.  \"Heaven was Needing a Hero\" and \"Get up Again\" are both great songs, with \"Get Up Again\" a throwback to an \"I'm Alright\" life is good anthem song. \"I like Me\" has promise but it's a bit all over the place.  \"How do you get High\" isn't as scandalous as it sounds, in fact, it really doesn't say anything as a song.  People get their fixes from different places.  Okay.  So..... \"Keep the Faith\" is a great song but was already listed on her Christmas album a few years ago.  \"That's God\" is well-written but not a radio hit.  As a whole, not a bad cd, but nothing you want to sing out loud and jam to in the car.  But new music from Jo Dee Messina after waiting for five years is truly priceless....","27":"This CD brought back lots of good memories of the music of 60's & 70's. It has the hits that made Los Rancheritos famous, songs to sing to and music to enjoy. If you like this kind of music, then you'll enjoy the 60 Exitos, I know I do! Thanks Juani","28":"Disturbing sound.  If I had listened to a preview, I would never have bought it.","29":"In My opinion Coko has made the transition from secular music to gospel , I love this song .","30":"This is heartwarming entertainment","31":"A Friend of Mine got me Hooked on this Song\nI love It!!\nBest Sick Puppies Song Ever!!\nYou gotta hear it!!","32":"I like it but then I never wanted to hear it again, just got so old right away!","33":"I prefer TAL episodes that are both entertaining and informative.  This one was just a little too fluffy for me.  Not enough meat there.","34":"It really got me.","35":"Some of U-Roy's best toasts plus dubs by the master King Tubby. This album is a no-brainer.","36":"There is too much yelling.","37":"I bought this digital download (I would rather have a physical CD!) because I love some of Joe Hisaishi's music from watching a few of Miyazaki's cartoons.  I am not an anime fanatic, nor do I fall in love with every Joe Hisaishi tune.  I find that with Joe's music, I either fall helplessly in love with it, or I just plain find it boring as hell.  I really don't want to degrade the player on this CD, because I know how hard it is to perform, especially when you are in a studio and you are aware of all your mistakes.  This player is good, plays all the right notes.  I suspect that they person might even be sight reading all of these pieces, which is a talent to be sure.  Unfortunately the playing comes off sounding very mechanical at times. Either way, there are some real gems on this album.  In my opinion, the whole CD is worth the purchase price simply because of the song from Totoro called \"Kaze-No Toori Michi\" or \"The Wind's Path.\"  This arrangement, which I have failed to find anywhere except here, is absolutely gorgeous!!  Whoever arranged this is simply brilliant!  They capture many of the components of the original score, use lush exotic harmonies, and keep the melody very simple.  The introductory repetitive left hand passage keeps the piece moving giving it an undercurrent of longing, sadness, or maybe just expressing the unbiased non-emotional qualities of nature and the wind?  I don't know, but it reminds me of what a progressive rock keyboardist might do with it like Keith Emerson, or Eddie Jobson.  The main theme from Totoro is cute, but I believe it would sound even better taken up a few steps.  It's played without the happy qualities that it should be played with, and again, very mechanical.  Regardless, I did give it 5 stars because it has many redeeming qualities.","38":"Beautiful soundtrack. Great for background music during activities like office work, homework, yoga, etc.","39":"Love the album.","40":"A decent album, somewhat mediocre. Nothing special really stood out, they may be good live. Also reminds me of Sheryl crow. Not great, not bad, not memorable. You might really like it if you're not exposed to much music, maybe buyers of 2 CDs a year.","41":"I bought ZERO because I loved the Taller Children album and the MP3 download was only $5.\nSampled the songs and wasn't impressed but I thought that after I listened a little more it would grow on me. Nope.\nBasically the album is boring\/monotonous. Her voice is still wonderful but stays within a narrow range. The music is also uninspired.\nI miss the playfulness of Taller Children, the chills that Right Next To You created.","42":"It is just so lovely!","43":"It's nice that the author is the reader. Sounds like he's just talked no about what he knows. So, it comes across more as a class rather than a book.","44":"NICE!","45":"Beautiful music.","46":"From the arrangements to the playing to the sound- one of the finest releases in the last 10 years IMHO. From 1,000's of CD's, this is one that holds one's interest with repeated listenings.","47":"I find new songs and old ones I've forgotten about for hooping and jumping by listening to Pandora. This is one that I never heard before a few days ago; it grabbed me immediately and I knew I wanted to hoop to it. So for either listening or exercise, this is a great song.\n\nIf you're interested in my hooping and jumping videos, search for QFEGuy on youtube, and I have a blog. You can also search for  \"Quest For Endorphins\". Nothing is for sale - I'm trying to demonstrate the shape you can be in and how much fun you can have exercising when you're 66; 67 in a few days.","48":"Ira and the crowd - what more need I say?","49":"Never got it!","50":"This is a pretty song. We needed this for our wedding. MP3 was clear and easy to download. Good song.","51":"Human touch and other songs, sung by a great artist.  You will enjoy this artist songs as you chill or have a romantic moment with your special person.","52":"This is another great song by Kem.  I find myself listening to this song over and over again and singling along to it.  I am so happy I purchased this one.  I have all the others, as well.","53":"great","54":"This is a killer live recording.  From \"nothin to lose\" to \"burning up\" Rocks from start to finish. Thanks for 34 years of joy.","55":"Beautiful !!!!!!!!","56":"Love this song!","57":"Great song","58":"This works great in a spoof of a horse throwing it's long mane around.  The song is so awful it's hysterical.","59":"It is one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have encountered in a long time. The music is well put togather if you need rest and relation this is a cd to do just that .","60":"I thought the quality suffered on this one, I would not advise a purchase unless you are a diehard fan, then go for it, you probably won't even notice the digital issues","61":"all sounds good","62":"what does it mean to be in the middle of nowhere? What constitutes 'somewhere'? First world pondering.","63":"The product description is not definitive as to what you are getting. The price, $8.98, implies a full album. I ordered it and got a single. I intend to ask for a refund.","64":"It says explicit, but I didn't hear any cursing at all. This song rocks HARD. Loved it.","65":"As far as bands go these days this is one band I find very good for the mainstream market. I usually like melodic progressive metal over the commercialized rock these days but this band is a crossover. It pleases the melodic heavy music lover on both sides. Great stuff!","66":"I'm a huge fan of Love and Light and what they stand for.  Although this is not my favorite selection of tracks, I still will listen to it and enjoy what it is...a good grooving pure sound.","67":"Great","68":"Was hoping it was the song from the movie. Whatever this is, sucks!","69":"WOW I LOVE Lee's song \"Sweet Serendipity\"...amazing, beautiful, awesome! I can not stop listening to this song, my face is smiling and my feet and heart are dancing!!!  Yes I was surprised when I first heard this song because its so different from his previous CD's and songs from American Idol (Lee is my ALL time favorite Idol).  WOW I love and adore this \"New\" Lee...I can not wait for his new Album \"Live It Up\"...if this song is any indication to what is on his album I know it will be a great success. I am looking forward to following Lee's career and new music for many years to come.  Congratulations Lee you are such an amazing and talented performer and person...you hit it big! You deserve it and should be extremely proud...Enjoy!","70":"Gifted writer, poet, vocalist who includes Malidoma Some along with Mandela and King in the same poem.\nI admire that he repeats his poem several times during each presentation.\nPowerful images!","71":"I am open minded and found different interpretations of the bible entertaining to listen to however, it may offend some people. The story telling, journalism and reporting is excellent. If your not easily offended by alternative points of view about the bible I would recommend it.","72":"What songs are on this disk? There are a few songs I'm after most are on Magic Morning Show Raw but there are other songs I want that aren't on it.","73":"Love this soundtrack. Have it on CD but wanted it for my mp3 player.","74":"Needtobreathe is always great, but I think these songs done live are some of their best work. Always original and unique, Needtobreathe fans will love this!","75":"I was watching a tv series on DVD that I thoroughly enjoy (Life) and the background music for one of the episodes began to haunt me.  I caught part of a phrase in the song that went, \"breathe through it all, don't forget to smile when you fall.\"\nAnd searching for that phrase led me, without further ado, to the album, \"Game Called Life\" by Leftover Cuties.  Then it was a snap to find the album for sale in digital form at Amazon.com and purchased and downloaded it.  It's their own brand of jazz and I love it.  Makes me imagine the prohibition days and the charleston days.  And a cover of a Lady Gaga song!  With Leftover Cuties I've been enchanted and captivated by a female vocalist that breathed new life into songs like You Are My Sunshine and the very talented musicians that together form this incredible band.  Give it a preview, odds are you'll love it!","76":"This is not really reggae and should never come up in a search for reggae mixes, would be upset if it wasn't so cheap.","77":"This is one of the best instrumental songs around. Very nice and chill music.","78":"This song is perhaps the most annoying peice of sh*t I have ever heard!","79":"This song is perhaps the most annoying peice of sh*t I have ever heard!","80":"Perfect!  Thank you!","81":"Hilarious!","82":"Joe satriani is such a great guitarist a must have for any rocker","83":"Received this Audio CD as a gift and for the most part it's great, but I do have a small issue with a few tracks.  There seems to be a 300Hz beep\/tone every 45 seconds on \"Is There Love In Space?\" and \"Super Colossal\".  This sound is audible on various different CD players too.  I have verified that the sound is NOT present on the same tracks from other sources.  Not sure what to make of this glitch?","84":"I guess I was expecting something different based on what I hear from him on the airwaves. Thiis collection of songs is chosen by Satriani as a sample of his favorites. To me a lot of it sounds the same. He is obviously a virtuoso guitar player, but the sound gets redundant. Lots of music here.","85":"This has to be one the worst recordings of Roberto Yanez. It is hard to tell how much is cased by the recording set up or just simply a bad choice of the intrument used.","86":"Macklemore is one of those artists that just takes your breath away, fresh, fun and heartfelt. Great music.","87":"Original was better in my opinion. The remix just isn't what I think of when I think of Irish music.","88":"this remix is terrible...  Heard the original and loved it, this is just bad...  Really bummed as I love the music and the song but just couldn't do this.","89":"As the title says this is just an annoying remix in my opinion. Couldnt find the original on amazon and was forced to the get the orignal a different way.","90":"Did not realize this was a remix version.  The original is better than the remix.  Love Macklemore and Ryan Lewis though!","91":"Love the son but I download ad it and can't find it so I had to go to play store on my phone and download a music downloader","92":"It's hard to find hip hop artists that have substance, but these guys tell a great story and make it hard to turn them off. I predict greater things in their future to accompany their current accomplishments.","93":"Good album","94":"The entire last two discs are devoted to nothing but dumb musical cues which sound like porno movie music or cheap TV movie music. Want full refund on this item.","95":"I have heard better recordings of this song.  Try this one \"Stay with me\" another great Jose song.","96":"What an amazing song from Cooper Boone!  It really puts things into perspective and I play it often to remind myself that life surely can change in an instant.  No matter what genre of music you enjoy, this is a must for your music library.","97":"One of my favorite pieces that I've heard in a long time. I love how it's dynamic and alive, yet soulful and wistful. It's both sad and hopeful, and you can truly feel the emotion behind the music. What a beautiful tribute!","98":"From the very best","99":"I love Erin O'Donnell's music and this arrangement. It is so peaceful, and relaxing to listen to it....great music not only for Christmas.","100":"This is not the actual soundtrack. The audio quality is very poor and each track is only small portions of each song. I was the most disappointed with Track 11 (From This Moment On), the main reason I wanted to purchase this album. The carefully\/deviously cut the instrumental portions of the song where there is not singing...only dancing in the film...which is some of the greatest music of the entire song. All that to say, an originally 6 minute song turned into a 2:36 song. Such a huge disappointment.","101":"Great stories!!!  I have to listen.....it's addictive!","102":"This is a very catchy and inspirational tune on what it means to be self-reliant. I remember the song when it first came out because it was being promoted for the newer version of the Charlie's Angels Movie (Charlie's angels is even quoted in the song). I like the positive theme to the song about learning to always be independent in all areas of your life, and of it being 50\/50 in relationships. The song sends a positive message to avoid depending on others to give you what you want, and to instead find ways to obtain your desires through your own means (the group cleverly does this by using lyrics such as \"the shoes on my feet, I bought it\", and with mentioning how they even paid for the place they live in). This is also a good song to listen to for putting oneself in a prosperous state of mind.  Overall, this is definitely a song to listen to if you like any of Beyonce's songs and\/or any music from Destiny's Child.","103":"I'm disappointed with my purchase because I was looking to buy the original song by the Carpenters,  but Amazon blocks music to non unlimited music members. What a bummer!","104":"Not a tribute to the Carpenters, terrible.","105":"I love this song from the movie, but after I got it, it stops playing before the music is finished.  I'm not very happy about that.  That's the only\nreason I gave it one star.  It would be 5 stars if I could hear the whole thing!!","106":"Not a fan of \"country\" rap.","107":"Sorry ... I didn't read the part where it said Tribute album. Guess it was my fault and poor eyesite.","108":"Just my preference-nothing will replace the original.","109":"its fake!","110":"Not happy with this one. It's my bad because I didn't listen to any of it before I bought it. It's not the Carpenters singing. If I could return it I would.","111":"Not the carpenters.... Not even close....  Be careful not to get lured to this link when looking for Carpenters greatest hits....\n\nYou will be sorely dissappointed....  appears to be no way to return to Amazon...  Not good.","112":"I thought it was a REAL Carpenters album. They try hard.... But there's no mistaking Karen Carpenter. It would have been better if they hadn't tried.","113":"NOT the Carpenters... not even close to being the Carpenters.","114":"If I could give this hunk of crap less than one star, I would!! TOTALLY misleading title! DO NOT PURCHASE!! NOT THE CARPENTERS!!","115":"Only listened to the first few bars when I realized this was a knock-off of the Carpenters. While searching for the album this appeared first on the list from Amazon and the album art prominently displays THE CARPENTERS greatest hits while I did not notice The Poppers recorded it. IMO it should be refundable. Too late, already purchased.","116":"This enormous set (66 rockin' tunes) covers a wide range of music styles - from blues to country to rockabilly to rock.  You can tell that Sam Phillips, Sun Records founder and engineer, was still developing the \"Sun sound\" and had not perfected it yet as heard in later Sun recordings.  You'll find a couple of the tracks sound like field recordings done on location.  Nevertheless, the performances are way cool and the energy is there.  I played this record during a long car ride and it was an excellent way to make the miles go by.  Very cool.","117":"There will never again be a Sun Records sound! EVER! These recordings are highly rare and should be listend to with great respect! To all who don't like this kind of music-----just rememmber this! That Rock n Roll music thet you all listen to was born at Sun Records!","118":"All instrumental. It's fast paced, fun, and enjoyable to listen to. Great background music for working, running RPGs with a spy theme, or driving.","119":"Item delivered on time, and was as described.","120":"This is the version of the classic Yiddish tune that everyone on the borscht circuit is emulating. Also, his voice is in a lower register than most modern day singers, reflecting the styles of the time.","121":"works great!","122":"love it fast shipping","123":"Fun at first. Then devolves into gibberish. Being at The Cotton Club in the roaring 20's would have been all time epic tho.","124":"Perfect! Thank you!","125":"I love Bing's voice - in the age of crooners, he was the man.  This song takes me back (I'm not from that generation, but my imagination comes alive).  The lyrics are great as well; nice way to explain storms to a child.  Recommend for any Bing fan and to parents.","126":"So do I, especially after hearing these guys do it.  This is a pretty good cut from an old recording but it shimmys just enough.  This is a great old song.","127":"It never down loaded, don't know what else to say.","128":"Very bad cover of this song.","129":"Where do I begin?\nFirst off, I really, really, really wanted to like this album. After reading the stories and reviews I figured this was right up my alley. As a lover of all things pop and bubblegum, I thought this would be on an equal plane of the best Ohio Express, 1910 Fruitgum Co, Association, Archies, Patridge Family all rolled into one.\nAlas, it is not to be.\nThere is nothing memorable here, nothing that will leave you humming the rest of the day. No hit singles to speak of. I've heard this was one of the most expensive albums made at the time. I think they tried and tried and tinkered over and over to perfect the sound and come up with a hit to no avail. The sound is fine, I have it on 180 gram vinyl. It's just the songs. They just sit there, with all their little background noises.\nThe only song I actually like is I'm With You. It sounds like the aforementioned Association crossed with The Partridge Family.\nI've tried playing it over and over but nothing sticks. Not the song titles and not the cold, sterile tunes themselves.\nIt sounds bright and sunny but is hollow and empty beneath.","130":"This whole LP musically, is beautifully arranged...\nIf you love sunshine, baroque psychedelia,\nthen this is for you..\nRecommended.","131":"Wrote the wrong review for Pieces, which I got at the same time as the cd for Begin.  My review of Begin under the Millenium Pieces cds said this was nice and clear, with a mix that was not as complicated as the vinyl I had over 40 years ago.  The Pieces cd is demos and works in progress that never made it to release.  Not as complicated but a simpler Begin (ing).  Both are good cds.","132":"Love this song but waste of 1.29 it won't play or download to my phone!","133":"Luke Vibert's first release under his own name, A POLISHED SOLID, for the famed Mo Wax label, are three cuts of abstract hip-hop. The title track brings in some sax, but those disappear under layers of EQ sweeps and a looped sample saying, \"Oh, Christ.\" Meanwhile, \"Radart\" sort of meanders in a pleasing way, and \"Frogs Belly\" lets loose the jazz, with a tinge of Wagon Christ cheekiness. An auspicious start.","134":"Beautiful, nostalgic work by George Shearing's Quartet and Orchestra!!","135":"I have just transcribed the original UK vinyl(which I have treasured all these years) to MP3 and I'm shocked to find Amazon selling such a travesty as a download. The pitch is noticeably lower and the tracks all run longer. \"Love Letters in the Sand\", for example, runs to 2'12\", not the 2'25\" Amazon claims. \"April Love\" lasts 2'39\", not 2'54\" - yes, that's how big the difference is. As the last reviewers says, if you're buying the CD, make sure it sounds better than these downloads. (My LP, by the way, includes all 14 tracks; I don't believe \"Capistrano\" and \"Louella\" were bonuses.)","136":"This CD is a British London Records version of the original mono \"Pat's Great Hits\" with 2 bonus tracks added - \"When The Swallows Come Back to Capistrano\" and \"Louella\". I used to have that LP, and the speed was quite correct. However, at least the Mp3 samples here at Amazon are awfully slow. So, before buying the CD, make sure it sounds at normal speed.  You can also look for the \"Greatest Hits\" CD which contains 8 original mono tracks from \"Pat's Great Hits\" plus other great songs. As for myself, I made a CDR compilation of all Pat Boone main original Dot Records albums from 2 box sets of the Bear Family \"Pat Boone, The 50's Complete\" and \"The Sixties, 1960-1962\".","137":"Pat was a pretty good singer in his day, and he made some really nice recordings.  But these downloads will need a little work to adjust the speed at which they play.  The Audacity program (free) should help bring the speed up to normal, but why should one have to jump through all those hoops?  At least these recordings are the orginal hits, and not Pat's absolutely HORRID re-recordings after his voice had really gone down the dumper.  It's very appropriate that \"Speedy Gonzales\" is not a part this set. I'd keep searching for something else if you don't want to run these tracks through an audio editor in order to make them listenable.","138":"Good song","139":"My wife loves this song","140":"I just didn't enjoy this album. This album is a bit too much back-roads country for me to appreciate.","141":"You'll have to buy this to know what's in it. More than that, you'll have to buy it AND LISTEN TO IT to know what's in it. That's because there is no track list anywhere, not in the Amazon pages and not in the downloaded product. I know. I bought it thinking that the track list would surely appear in the downloaded clip. Wrong! All that you'll see there are the same misleading words that you see on Amazon's pages: \"See description for track details\". Fix this, Amazon. This is absurd. Why hide the track information from prospective buyers?","142":"I wake up in the middle of the night and put on public television to help me fall back to sleep - and that is where I first heard these guys.  They were so good, they woke me up!  Of course, I looked for their music on Amazon which is much less expensive than buying the premium packages on public tv.  I have both their cds.  I play them in my car and copied them onto my iphone. I also play the cd as background music when I have guests.  Their music is versatile and cheerful and energizing.  I really like the combination of piano and strings.  Their pieces include original music and variations of songs you'll recognize.  I like them enough that I am going to see them when they play in my area in the fall.  Enjoyable.  Upbeat.  Fun.","143":"Love the idea of this cd. But it's hard to understand the singers... Even after reading the lyrics I had a hard time picking out the names of the presidents and their wives in the songs... They should've slowed it down and made it more clear, and it may confuse some kids since a lot of the names are run the names together.","144":"Bought this for our 4 year old because it was recommended by her school. This CD stays on rotation in the car and is a popular request. Its very repetitive which I feel lends to increased memorization. Quite frankly, it drives me crazy, but she's committing the presidents to memory and she's four...I think I can deal with that!","145":"Listening to Bach cantatas sung in English is extremely annoying to me.  They should be sung in the original language which Bach intended.  Bach composed mainly from German texts, with rare exceptions such as Cantata #209, \"Non Sa Che Sia Dolore\".  Please do not try to \"improve\" the work of the greatest composer in history !","146":"I owned this album which I bought when I was a kid on LP.  I was excited to get a cleaned up digital version ... but this album and Volume 1 are messed up.  This was originally a 2 LP set with four sides, A, B, C, D.  Ragtime Special Volume 1 has sides A and C but for side C the titles of the songs are from side B.  (Got that?)  Volume 2 has side B but the titles are from side C.  I don't know what happened to side D.  Check out track 6 here \"Poor Butterfly\".  That's not it.  No idea how to contact Amazon support.  This is a good pair of albums if you want to get 3\/4s of the songs and you're willing to rename them.","147":"Vocalion is a pretty neat label. They're re-issuing and rescuing some great tunes from the vinyl graveyard. I own several of their CDs. Love the music on this one, but it's got a very muffled sound. The volume setting is out of line with other songs in my WMP \"playlists\". So I have go turn up the volume then quickly turn it down again when the song is over. Be easier to nix it from my playlists, but then I'd never hear it.","148":"Huh?","149":"When I recieved this LP,it didn't have the pink obi paper strip on it like it has in the picture that was next to the description. But other than that,I'm satisfied with the album. It plays well,and it was a good transaction. AAAA++++\n\nFrom Cacilie","150":"Norman Luboff's arrangements of American music have been a delight to me since my high school days in the '50s, and are a large part of the reason I began composing and arranging songs myself about thirty years ago.  This disc is a terrible example of Luboff's work.  The tracks I was interested in hearing are of numbers that he arranged magnificently, and these are NOT those arrangements.","151":"I only wanted  one  song by the  light of the silvery moon and you added a lot of other songs that i hate at my exspence and that  sucks!","152":"This music is amazing. I cannot believe that this group is not more popular. If you're thinking about buying their music, stop thinking and do it already! You won't regret it. Wish is one of my favorite songs....EVER. Love these guys!","153":"Giggles & laughter while singing some of these with my dad, not having a clue to the real meanings at the time.","154":"I heard Siobhan McKenna do the soliloquy live and it was stunning.  The recording was too soft and often times I couldn't pick up what she was saying.  I was very disappointed.","155":"Many of us, I guess, associate Mrs. Ward with uptempo, revivalist tunes. Here she settles into a beautiful, affecting, rendition. Maybe the best I've ever heard\/seen, on film-video. (Until someone locates footage of Little Richard's performance at Madison Square Garden, in 1972). :)","156":"When I first saw the February 2013 CD release by Real Gone Music titled Beautiful People I thought, at last, a comprehensive compilation covering multiple award-winning Country singer\/songwriter Kenny O'Dell, who had 6 Country charters and two on the Billboard Pop Hot 100 from 1967 to 1979. However, the 18-track CD instead offers the 11 sides from his 1967 LP \"Beautiful People\" (Vegas VS-401) together with 7 bonus track from his Vegas\/White Whale output. The good news for hits collectors is that you will get all four sides of his two Pop entries - Beautiful People - # 38 Hot 100 in November\/December 1967 on Vegas 718 b\/w Flower Girl, and Springfield Plane - # 94 Hot 100 in February 1968 on Vegas 722 b\/w I'm Gonna Take It.\n\nSo, it looks like we're going to have to wait longer for a CD containing these 6 Country hits: You Bet Your Sweet, Sweet Love - # 58 March 1974 - Capricorn 0038 b\/w Let's Go Find Some Country Music; Soulful Woman - # 18 Jan\/Feb 1975 - Capricorn 0219 b\/w Let's Get On The Road; My Honky Tonk Ways - # 37 Country and # 105 Hot 100 Bubble Under June 1975 - Capricorn 0233 b\/w Behind Closed Doors; Let's Shake Hands And Come Out Lovin' - # 9 July\/Aug 1978 - Capricorn 0301 b\/w We Might Be All Nite; As Long As I Can Wake Up In Your Arms - # 12 Dec 1978 - Capricorn 0309 b\/w Soulful Woman (re-issue); and Medicine Woman - # 32 April 1979 - Capricorn 0317 b\/w Who Do I Know In Denver?\n\nSome of the foregoing appeared in this 1974 LP \"Kenny O'Dell (Capricorn CP-0140) which contains: A1. Soulful Woman; A2. Everything I Am; A3. I'll Find Another Way (To Say I Love You); A4. Lord, Am I Dreamin'?; A5. Let's Get On The Road; A6. Easy Street; B1. Behind Closed Doors; B2. House Of Love; B3. Let's Go Find Some Country Music; B4. I Take It On Home; B5. You Bet Your Sweet, Sweet Love, and in his 1978 album \"Let's Shake Hands And Come Out Lovin'\" (Capricorn CPN-0211) which offers: A1. Let's Shake Hands And Come Out Lovin'; A2. We Can Make Music; A3. When It's Just You And Me; A4. Soulful Woman; A5. Behind Closed Doors; B1. Who Do I Know In Denver?; B2. As Long As I Can Wake Up In Your Arms; B3. We Might Be All Night; B4. Thank You Everlovin'; B5. I Take It On Home.\n\nAll we need is for some distributor to pull the different sides in these two LPs together with a bonus track to include My Honky Tonk Ways. That's the very least they could do to honour the writer inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame for writing such gems as Behind Closed Doors, a mega-hit for Charlie Rich, The Judd's Mama He's Crazy, and Loretta Lynn's Trouble in Paradise, just to name a few.","157":"This album has Curly Chalker, legendary steel player all over it!!  I just love the album.  I had this album many years ago, and loaned it to a friend; never got it back, and it is out of print.  Glad I was able to find it on Amazon.","158":"Theme From Mahogany by Diana Ross was released in 1875 and charted #1 pop. Fans of Diana Ross will like this the most.","159":"I came across this song while I was watching youtube videos for the BBC Show Merlin. WONDERFUL SERIES! It stuck in my head, and I downloaded it, so I didn't have to keep pushing replay on the video to hear it ;)","160":"This song is my new favorite; it makes me think of all the good times I had when I was a kid playing make-believe games with my best friends, and speaks of the hope that we never grow apart and forget each other.","161":"\"Speak Now\" is a wonderful Taylor Swift song that our granddaughter, age 8, memorized after hearing it one time, as she does any song that she likes. This is a wonderful song with a lot of meaning that she can relate to as we try to teach her that later in life she will have to bring her future husband to her grandfather to get his approval before she can marry him and he must be a fine suitor for such a fine granddaughter. Your money will be well spent as it is a wonderful song as well as it is a good conversation piece for girls, daughters, and granddaughters and does not have any bad language in it. Our granddaughter loves to imitate \"American Idol\" and we are the judges and she does this 100 percent and is off to Hollywood as we speak!","162":"music to my soul, precious treasure. thank i could not enjoy it if you did not sell it,xo xo xo","163":"Great!","164":"Everyone ahould know it by now.

Her voice is amazing.","169":"How did he know!?","170":"Liz Longley is a Pennsylvania native who studied voice at Berklee College of Music in Boston.  She has a great voice, expressive and conveying strong emotion.  \"High Loose Wire\" is her sophomore set.  \"Avery\" packs a powerful song with its story-song lyric about a thoughtless lover and the girl who still kind of loves him, \"You got so damn high, you left me in Wisconsin.  I was sound asleep as you drove my car away.  About a hundred miles south of where we were going, I was stuck in a stale motel just cursing your name.\"  \"Goodbye Love\" slows the pace with Liz's vocals conveying hurt as a result of romantic betrayal, \"There's a place our love remains, it's captured in time; It's still sitting by the river, your hands woven into mine.\"  This is a really beautiful song.  Longley also includes two covers.  Van Morrison's \"Moondance\" and Joni Mitchell's \"River\" both are given exceptional treatments.  Liz Longley is an incredible talent, one you want to know well!  Enjoy!","171":"Andrew Jasso's music will calm your soul. He is a very talented young man, whose music will touch your mind, soul, and spirit. Looking forward to your next album Andrew!

For a dollar can't go wrong. Most of the songs from this album Aldo rock, buy this is one of my top 3 favorites from it","181":"The quality of the MP3 versions this album is VERY POOR.  It was \"ripped\" in VBR format to reduce the file size.  Amazon would lies about it, saying the record company demands they only offer low quality VBR rather than CBR.  (Variable Bit Rate vs. Constant Bit Rate)  VBR recorded MP3s are inherently lower quality even though if you complain to Amazon they will tell you that they are ripping the music that way to improve quality.  TOTAL BS!!!!!  IF you want to buy this album in MP3 format, try a different vendor.  One positive note:  Amazon did refund my money when I complained.","182":"This version of this song is dubbed from a vinyl LP and has scratches in the sound.  The label, Hallmark, is not Columbia, which recorded the song and has the master tapes.  I found the sound quality to be unacceptable.","183":"Classic 60's car song.  Captures the excitement of spontaneous racing.","184":"It's surprising how many classic Christmas LPs have never been re-mastered for conversion to CD, none more so than Christmas Carols by Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra which first came out in 1958 as mono Dot 3148 containing: White Christmas; It Came Upon A Midnight Clear; O Holy Night; Deck The Halls; The First Noel; Joy To The World; Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful); Silent Night; God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen; O Tannenbaum (O Christmas Tree); Hark! The Herald Angels Sing; Faith Of Our Fathers; Jingle Bells; O Little Town Of Bethlehem.\n\nOver the years with subsequent reissues there were 3 different covers with the original having a mostly yellow cover and a stylized drawing of a sleigh inside a large red oval (which made it a bit odd in that Sleigh Ride itself was not among the tracks). In 1959 the same album came out in stereo (Dot 3148\/25148), with a glossy front cover, \"Billy Vaughn\" in white on a green background and gold-embossed \"Christmas Carols\" on red, with a gold embossed border. When re-issued again a few years later the cover was a flat red, the \"Dot\" logo in its usual 3 colors situated in a green circle, \"Billy Vaughn\" in white and \"Christmas Carols\" in yellow. Charting-wise it made it to # 145 on Billboard's Christmas charts in 1962 and # 101 in 1967.\n\nSome of the tracks have appeared on these CDs: Christmas With Billy Vaughn & His Yuletide Orchestra - 9 of the same tracks in a 10-track 2006 release that includes Auld Lang Syne; Christmas Classics, a 1996 release from Chicago Music Company that contains the same 10 sides; and Christmas Song, a 2012 release from Essential Media Group containing the same line-up. None of these include God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen or White Christmas, nor can I say with any certainty that they are all the same original 1958 renditions.\n\nWhy that has never been re-mastered for CD is a puzzle since Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra wasn't just some run-of-the-mill band back then. After being part of the highly-successful Dot vocal quartet known as The Hilltoppers, who had 15 hit singles for the label from 1952 to 1954, he left to form the in-house Dot orchestra in 1954 that would go on to back the vast majority of Dot artists on so many hit singles and albums (e.g. Pat Boone, Gail Storm, The Fontane Sisters, Tab Hunter, Nick Todd (Pat Boone's brother), and many more for years to come.\n\nIn the midst of all that, he and his orchestra would rack up some 31 hit singles of their own from their first, Melody Of Love in late 1954\/early 1955, to their last in 1967, I Love You (And You Love Me), while selling albums in the millions, 4 of which went Gold: The Golden Instrumentals (1956); Sail Along Silv'ry Moon (1958); Blue Hawaii (1959); and Theme From A Summer Place (1960).\n\nA great deal of his music is available on CD, so why are they dragging their heels with his premier Christmas album?","185":"I've been sorting through boxes of old Christmas albums and commenting on most that are listed here at Amazon, lamenting the fact that many have never been re-mastered for conversion to CD, since these were the ones us old duffers recall most fondly.

While the original order is appreciated, the sound quality is REALLY BAD.  Very unfortunate as it's a great album.\nI would hope Sony would release this album digitally.","187":"Funny, I've seen two different collections from Jill Corey and both are missing the only hit she had. It was called \"Love Me To Pieces\", out in the early 50's, and you'd think whoever put this and the other collection out would have known and included it with the other songs. Jill is best at upbeat songs,this CD is half and half, I don't care for the slow stuff, but this was the way the original was released. However by omitting that one song, which was a Huge hit, this CD is just missing a spark.","188":"Heard this song at a retreat recently and came home to add it to my player.  Powerful words and music!","189":"I thought I had heard all their songs but not this one.  I listened to it for an hour the first time I heard it just recently. Remarkable. Just plain loved it and had to buy it.","190":"Quality of the recording is quite bad.  Much worse than I'd expected and I probably wouldn't have purchased this track if I'd known about this issue.  It's unfortunate because it's a great song and shouldn't be sold unless it's up to reasonable par.","191":"Very Good to listen and dance to.","192":"Love this song.  It has very uplifting lyrics with a lilting melody.  It has a lovely string introduction and simple band support that makes this song feel intimate, honest and relaxed.","193":"Not good the all .","194":"This is one of the greatest 80s Christian pop albums ever created.  If that seems too niche, then let me say that it's just a great 80s pop album, period, with lyrics that happen to reflect Christian faith.  From first song to last, the earnest, earnest, heartfelt delivery and flawless keyboards will transport you back to a time when the world was brightly colored and extraneous zippers ruled.  Get it!","195":"This is a double CD including Crumbacher's first and second albums, 'Incandescent' and 'Escape From The Fallen Planet'.  If you just want a digital copy of Incandescent, find it on vinyl and rip it yourself, or get a remastered CDR.  The sound quality of that album on this disc is terrible, and the first few beats of the first song are missing.  'Escape' sounds a little better; I suspect a digital master was already available for it.  The print quality of the insert is also very bad.  I wish someone else would re-issue these with better quality.","196":"Not sure why this version was not very popular.  Beautiful arrangement of an old classic from my childhood.","197":"Good.","198":"This album was made in 1958, containing some of my favorite Monk tunes, all of which was played with the energy and musicianship that would have done a live performance credit.\n\nPersonnel on this session were:  Monk and Blakey on piano and drums, respectively, Bill Hardman on trumpet, the great Johnny Griffin on tenor saxophone and Spanky DeBrest on bass.\n\nThis is the original version of the album (in 1999 a reissue album added alternate takes of Evidence, Blue Monk and I Mean You. Personally, I prefer this original version, and sincerely believe that the renditions on this album of what are some of Monk's best compositions are among the best ever recorded in a studio. If you are strictly a Jazz Messenger fan, this is a good addition to your collection. If you are a Monk fan I recommend grabbing it.","199":"brings back memories of my dad singing this tune and playing guitar!","200":"Love Tim's #1 hits.

This was a follow-on to their inaugural album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ramsey-Lewis-And-His-Gentlemen-Of-Swing\/dp\/B004ADV5V6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ramsey Lewis And His Gentlemen Of Swing<\/a>, and was originally marketed as Volume 2.\n\nTrivia is fun, but the proof is in the music and this page has sound samples. Each track is clear and whoever did the remastering and mixing did a great job to my ears. You can clearly hear every note, with Eldee Young's bass perfectly in the mix, and Red Holt's exceptional brushwork and drumming coming in crystal clear. I've used this album and its companion as both a study aid and a play-along for getting my own brush chops up to a higher level.\n\nHowever you do not need to be a musician to enjoy this album. I will be honest and proffer an opinion that the music is competent and enjoyable, but not particularly exceptional.\n\nThat's not to say that the trio were not in top form - they were - and they were all virtuoso artists on their instruments. In fact Young was a master on cello (although not on this album) and all three were thoroughly grounded in music theory. However on this album they were just another very good jazz piano trio in a land filled with them. The main value of this album is the glimpse it provides into the trio's early years. That allows we fans to understand the foundation of the powerhouse trio they would become. As they drifted into pop and other forms of music their musical integrity would be called into question by the purists. This album proves otherwise.","208":"Played this on my phone for our student's to parade around our building!","209":"This version only contains the introduction to the song (first 20 seconds).

He had a very different and pleasing sound.","215":"As a fan of Dido's music over the years, I was pretty disappointed in this song.  There was not really any cohesion as to tune or chorus - that really would be OK in the grand scheme of music lovin', but as someone looking for \"more Dido music\" it was not exactly my taste in music.  I thought it worth saying due to the high-star reviews this song has otherwise gotten.","216":"What happens when you assign a bunch of contributors to write all new Christmas stories?\n\nYou get this podcast.\n\nThat's what it felt like, anyway.

Still, love the song!!\n\nP.S. Sorry if I have spelling errors, I'm only OK at spelling ( in my opinion )","225":"Blake is always great no matter what he sings. Particulary liked this song. Like the songs with stories in them.","226":"Imagine: Guitars that blaze with no reserve, while at the same time keeping the good riffs alive. Drums that stay simple but never let up. Skillful, reverberated vocals that melt steel(e). That certain air about an album that makes the discerned listener think \"80's!\" and throw up the horns instinctively....\nThese things were part of a style of metal that's now considered stale, untalented, retro, and anything else of the like to many people, shamefully many who are serious fans of metal. The style is straight up meat-and-potatoes heavy metal with no frills and no apologies. A forgotten flag proudly carried in the past by bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Accept, Queensryche, Saint, W.A.S.P., Stormwitch, Fifth Angel....and Sacred Warrior. Make no mistake, Sacred Warrior's debut, Rebellion, is not black metal, death metal, technical progressive algebra metal, beach metal, astral techno Jupiter moon metal, carpenter metal, symphonic metal, core-metal, coffee mug metal, or anything else except guitar heavy, scream filled, in your face American traditional\/power metal in the vein of the masters. In other words, this 1988 album serves as a great reminder of just why most metal fans got into metal in the first place. The songs here are simple, but extremely hooky, and always chock full of ultra great, over the top guitar playing and singing. There'll be no sheep heads flying off the stage, no deep nihilistic misanthropic whitebread message, no 'artful' avante garde snobbiness, no crap at all to be found. What there will be is a lot of banging of head due to the solid songwriting to be found here and trying to sing along with vocalist Rey Parra, a criminally overlooked belter in the style of Geoff Tate and Michael Kiske who can easily hold his own with the giants.\nAlthough there is a bit of variation in the overall quality of the songs on Rebellion, there are no real weak ones at all. There is a silly moment or two, such as in the opener, Black Metal - which doesn't seem to have a single thing to do with black metal at all, but does have a good line or two denouncing conformity within metal ('You try so hard to be like everyone else'). A weak melody here and there is also present, but Rey Parra's signature vibrato-drenched screams at the end close it off on a good note. Aside from the B-grade opener every single song is a winner, with some more obvious highlights in some places. Roughly half the album can be classified in the latter group, starting with the third song, Mad, Mad World. This song is simply an unbelievable piece of hard rock influenced, galloping heavy metal. The vocal layering in the chorus is enough to make the song amazing on it's own, but there's also the shredding of guitarist Bruce Swift (easily one of the most underrated metal guitarists), the sledgehammer headbanging part after the second chorus, and some extra virtuosoic vocal work by Parra after the solo.. the man can almost be seen red-faced, singing so hard his vocal cords are sticking out of his throat. Even the lyrics (which speak out about the deceptive and superficial nature of society) are pretty great, which is a good thing. Not that the content itself of the album is bad - there are a lot of uplifting messages of encouragement (Children of the Light, title track), warning (Master of Lies, Stay Away from Evil), and glorification of Jesus Christ (every song). The band's lyric writing ability is simply somewhat pedestrian on this album, so while there is always at least one good line to be found, overall the lyrics are almost too simple and minimalistic. Thankfully, however, they never get awkward or silly, except for a little bit in the aforementioned Black Metal, with the chorus sporting the line, 'Long hair, parted between the eyes\/Silk pants, wrapped tight round your thighs\/Each day goes by, you're living a dream'. Yes, there's no questioning that it was 1988...\nGoing back to the rest of the songs, not each song is the best of them, but every song has at least one great <i>defining<\/i> moment in it (usually the chorus) that really helps make the song, which is why Rebellion is such a solid album. Then, some songs are just top quality, such as Mad, Mad World, Stay Away From Evil, which is a shorter song but has some good riffwork and one of the more infectious choruses to be found, Famine, a mid paced song that harkens directly back to Number of the Beast\/Piece of Mind era Iron Maiden and features Rey Parra doing his very best Geoff Tate impersonation, and The Heavens are Calling, another galloper with some fiery solos and more catchy vocal work. The interesting thing about the chorus vocals on this album - like on The Heavens are Calling - is that many times instead of singing different verses with a set melody, there will be only one or two actual lines in the chorus, but introduced by 'general' vocalizations, like a 'Whooaaa, ohh ohhh', which helps give Rebellion a refreshing flair. There is also Children of the Light and Master of Lies, both excellent speed metal songs with big chorus hooks carried by Parra's huge vocal range and Bruce Swift laying down riff after riff and solo after solo. On a small negative note, the drums sound a bit odd on the faster songs - that's not to say that Tony Velazquez does a bad job behind the drumkit, but the drums just seem to be more engineered for the more midpaced, anthemic songs, and so when there's double bass pounding, the drum triggers stick out like a sore thumb. Of course, it could just be chalked up as part of the album's charm depending on your opinion.\nThe rest of the songs could be considered average, but not filler, which is important when an album has only 11 songs or under. Regardless, there's still something incredibly cool about each one, like the big riff\/solo set in the closer, Sword of Victory.\nRebellion is the kind of album everybody who enjoys metal should have at least a few of. There's nothing exactly like being refreshed with straight up well played heavy metal and that's what Sacred Warrior plays best.","227":"Not as good as I remembered it. She was a good writer, but was better off having others record her songs.","228":"FYI... The audio samples for this product are incorrect do not correctly represent this recording. These audio samples are running about 10% slower than they should be. As an example, the original 2 track stereo master runs at 15 ips and these audio samples are running approximately 13.5 ips. I know this to be true only because I am currently in possession of THE original flat stereo master tapes, not copies.","229":"really enjoy their music...thank you!","230":"I know my \"helpful\" rating will suffer from the title ... but come on .. you know it is accurate.  After first listen I thought this song was creepy. Next listen and I was thinking more comical.  Third listen and yeahhhhh it's kinda creepy, and that is without even looking at the cover art.  Decrepit lady sings of a lost distant love over a simple repeated guitar line, but toward the end a nice chorus of background angels come in to somewhat rescue this song.","231":"like","232":"great addition to my collection","233":"Love this song....CeeLo is a very diversified singer; check out his Christmas CD","234":"Like the song but it will not play on my Samsung 8.4 Tablet and I'm using the Amazon music app.","235":"this is not the original version the original CeeLo and Melanie Fiona. I like to change to the original version.","236":"Ken Nordie's performance is fine, just as expected.  The problem is the low quality conversion from analog to CD.  There are a number of places where the sound is clipping.  Hallmark Entertainment \/ Original Recording version.","237":"I love the variety on this album and CeeLo shows off with the range of styles.  Wish he was in the studio now and producing new or renewed classics - try Old Fashioned, and Its Ok","238":"This song goes out to my ex wife, wherever she is out there. I can't imagine any song expressing the sentiment I have toward her any better than this song as sung by CeeLo Green.","239":"I might give a better review if I can ever find out how to actually listen to it.","240":"I love this album.  Cee Lo makes great music, from Goodie Mob to Gnarls Barkley to this new mix of songs.  And what a great price!\nIf you love Cee Lo like I do, BUY THIS NOW!","241":"Cee-Lo is a bit of an odd character. He starts off the song with a monologue about how unique he is and lives by no rules. Then he moves into the meat of the song.  Although this is a #1 rated song on many lists, I can't recommend it. It is meandering and really didn't catch me at all. You shoudl take a listen to the preview and see what you think but I just don't think it is that good.","242":"This collection of original tunes shows just what an exception singer \/ songwriter Jack Miller is. The performances are nothing less than stellar recorded with some of Jamaica, California and Hawaii's finest musicians. Featuring rhythm aces Sly & Robbie on the title track with Nick Manson\/piano, Andy Suzuki\/horns, Glen Goto\/keys and Bonnie Bowers\/backing vocals. Multi-instrumentalist Reggae Griffin's production shines through out.  Miller has always been hard to 'put in a musical bag' mixing up jazzy R&B with Reggae. LOVE HAS A WAY is a perfect musical fit!","243":"Wave of Sand fulfills the central purpose of what a new age song is supposed to do, i.e., send the listener to a serene place.","244":"Fantastic disc. Saw these guys live at a music festival in Cape Breton, and they were amazing. Great fiddling and innovative and energetic guitar accompaniment.","245":"Great stories","246":"Not a Donna Summer album, much less her best.  Not one of these songs sound like Donna's voice.  Sounds like studio singers and musicians.  Money grab.","247":"Horrible.  Not Donna Summer at all.","248":"When did Donna Summer sing these songs? When she was 6?? I've never heard one of them and I grew up in the 80's and love Disco music. You really should take this down as THIS IS NOT THE BEST OF DONNA SUMMER. i DONT know these songs.","249":"Disappointed","250":"This is NOT a Donna Summer recording! Donna Summer is Not on this record!\nPeople are trying to cash in on her success. She has stated for years that these are not her recordings.\nPlease keep your money.","251":"Very nice version of this song.","252":"reminds me of the great Conferring With The Moon\/Imaginary Roads time period.\n\nThose two CD's are stone classics.\n\nThis one will grow with time.\n\nI've listened all the way through once.\n\nSuperb.","253":"I don't know who that is on the track, but it doesn't sound anything like the original song. Pass on this single.","254":"Great Music","255":"The description of this song says it is all three movements of the Moonlight Sonata.  When I listened to the mp3 it's only the second movement!  This needs to be changed on the description.  Amazon refunded my money, but as I said, it needs to be altered to prevent more frustrations!","256":"My greandkids love asking Alexia (Echo) to play these songs.","257":"The soothing voice of Kitty Kallen is as relaxing, rewarding, and as awe-inspiring as it was many years ago. Her voice, her message, and her delivery are timeless.","258":"Sound quality is very bad, I might say terrible, this is not an MP3 record, it is an MP0, nada, terrible. Buy any other Errol Garner CD instead, do not waste your money on it.","259":"This tracks opens with the final minute of Dukas \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\". Terrible production job. Is it so difficult to produce \"Danse Macabre\" on a separate track? Actual running time of \"Danse Macabre\" is 7:01. One star!","260":"Another great Spice 1 cd with Halloween as the theme which suits Spices style pretty good. Plenty of other artists on here and i loved the Spice 1 collabaration with OJ Da Juiceman on track 8. Would of given a 5 star mark if there were more tracks, 12 songs including 2 skits seems a bit skinny but the quality is a 5 for sure. Had track 3 playing in 2 different car stereos and only seemed to work on the left side speakers? But some good ones in here for Spice 1 fans, he never gets old.","261":"Competent but not with the inspiration and joy such a great and wonderful work deserves.","262":"I'm a huge Beegie Adair fan, so I made a leap of faith when I bought \"Into Somethin'.\"  There was no list of songs on the CD on Amazon's web site, but even so I bought it.  When I listened to it I realized I'd made a big mistake.  Obscure titles and bad vocals make this a real dud.  Save your money!","263":"I might buy this if there were a sound track to listen to.  There is not even a lsit of the songs on the album.  There is no way to rate it.","264":"Bought Mp3 June 2016 (H. Winterhalter Goes Latin-RED cover-Hallmark label)  DO NOT BUY THIS DOWNLOAD!!! It is an insult to the talent of Mr. Winterhalter and the RCA Living Stereo technology which produced & issued this wonderful music 50+ years ago.  This download is made from an old scratchY LP and sounds A W F U L!  It sounds like it is in monaural, depriving the listener of the full, wide-spectrum sound the RCA LIVING STEREO line was known for.  DO NOT BUY THIS!!!\n\nOn the other side of the coin is that there are other Hugo Winterhalter  Mp3 collections containing the same songs currently available through Amazon. I will be investigating those other versions of this GREAT music and will post my findings here. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION....YOU WON'T BE HAPPY.\n\nP.S. There are many reviews @ Amazon regarding these downloads. Unfortunately, it's impossible to know which reviews refer to which edition of this music. The \"DO NOT BUY\" version I'm speaking about was made available in 2009. There is a new issue from 2015 showing Mr. Winterhalter's face on a green background. Hopefully it's improved. That's my next attempt to get a clean copy of this music. I'll keep you informed, but............\n--------------------------------------DON'T BUY THE ONE WITH THE RED COVER---------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE AS OF JULY 12, 2016.\n\nI promised to get back to review ANOTHER mp3 of the same songs by Hugo Winterhalter, this time the one with the GREEN COVER and Hugo's face on that cover. Although these ARE NOT THE SAME RECORDINGS AS ON THE ORIGINAL LP WITH THE RED COVER, they are a huge improvement over the mp3 reviewed above. These recordings are in true stereo, have been \"cleaned up\", and sound good! Also, this download is a buck cheaper that the AWFUL ONE WITH THE RED COVER. If you want good versions of these terrific latin tunes, go for this one, you will not be disappointed, even though the recordings are NOT the same versions on the original RCA Hugo Winterhalter Goes Latin, which I encourage you to avoid on mp3.","265":"not a good transfer , this is an old scratchey record","266":"I'm still trying th figure out where the file is so that I can get it into iTunes.  If that becomes impossible I will cease buying music from Amazon.","267":"I first bought this album on 45EP, then later on LP. I was delighted to see it make its way to mp3! I think it's one of the best Pee Wee Hunt albums, along with STRAIGHT FROM DIXIE and DIXIELAND DETOUR, both of which are available on Amazon downloads under other titles. Great remembrance of my youth!","268":"I've loved this album since I first heard in in the late 70's. It's  another big Cal Smith hit with me.","269":"This was not \"Happy Days are Here Again\".  Must have the same name but some goofy tune.  Don't buy.","270":"I once owned this vinyl long-play record.  I was very disappointed to find that some of the numbers on it were missing from this download, notably the most memorable  piece on the record, Bikel's recitation of \"The  Vision of the Bones\" and also \"Mrs. McGrath.\"  There just isn't much left. No wonder it's so cheap.","271":"It was great!","272":"Excellent music. Well written, well-performed. Worth listening to.","273":"Got this CD set as an x-mas gift for our 2 yr old who loves Disney. The songs are bad renditions of actual Disney songs. The recording quality is horrible. You can hear mistakes in the singing and yet they were too lazy to start over and just put the CD out mistakes and all. The songs are also just snippets of the song. There are no full versions. What a waste of $$$$. Between the vocal mistakes, amateur vocals, and lazy recording techniques this CD falls short of a professional, acceptable CD set. Shame on this Orchestra for having such low standards and shame on Hallmark records for releasing this.","274":"Lower the price of this cd! This is and should be considered price gouging! Whether or not a cd is an import or not...nobody should have to pay this price for it!","275":"Iconic cover is about the best thing about this album. San Quentin is great, but the prisoners call for an encore and Johnny obliges, but why put it on the album? Has this ever happened before or since? I kept thinking 'maybe a riot will break out or someone will get shivved mid-song' but no, it is virtually the same. If I were locked up in San Quentin for twenty to life then I would happily sit through it forty times, but on my record player if and when I want an encore I can just lift the tonearm back a quarter inch. The version of Folsom Prison Blues is basically just Johnny thanking everyone then he sings the chorus once then leaves the stage. Ripped off - one of my favourites. Instead of San Quentin twice, Folsom once would have been great.\n\nOk rereading that now, \"extremely disappointing\" is too harsh, the versions of \"Walk the Line\" and \"Boy Named Sue\" and \"San Quentin\" Version No. 1 are must haves. \"Annoying\" is more accurate.","276":"Mastered from an inferior LP pressing.","277":"I've got to say that I love this.  What a nice piece of music.","278":"Don Francisco is a wonderful song writer and singer. I call him a Christian folk rocker. His theology is correct, not \"off the wall\" like some Christian artists. This 1981 album, which I downloaded from his website, had many great songs on it about Christian life. As Amazon doesn't list them, I will.\n\n1. Too Small a Price\/Joy. A joyful song about the moment Christ appeared in heaven after the resurrection.\n2. Since I Met Him. A song about the blind man Christ healed and his reaction to the healing in front of the Pharisees.\n3. The Lord and I Together. An upbeat song about walking with the Lord through the day.\n4. Beautiful to Me. A song about Jesus defending the woman who washed His feet in Simon the Pharisee's home.\n5. If You Ain't Gonna Sing the Gospel. A song about performers who are troubled in their performances. \"If you ain't gonna sing the gospel, you're gonna sing the blues.\"\n6. Messengers from Heaven. A political song about the US not paying as much attention to God as it used to.\n7. The Package. A humorous song about a package from the devil, a package which contained stuff the God would never send to his people. The end, which I won't give away, makes me LOL.\n8. You Can't Take It With You. A song that reminds us that what the material possessions we accumulate on earth, stay on earth, that only the things that go with us are those things which are spiritual.\n9. Give Your Heart a Home. My favorite song on the album, a song which reminds us that our plastic smiles and faces hide what we really need.\n10. The Traveler\/Joy. A song about the disciples when Jesus appeared to them after the resurrection.","279":"This mp3 download is of the original 1958 RCA VICTOR LP.\n\n.\nAs far back as 1953, RCA VICTOR experimented with two track recordings. Starting in '55, this company issued a series of stereo reel tapes and when Westrex developed a practical system for stereo LPs a couple of years later, RCA got into this format in a big way. In 1958, their first full year of LIVING STEREO album production, they issued about 200 titles. BOB AND RAY THROW A STEREO SPECTACULAR (LSP-1773) is one of these pioneering records.\n\nIt's really a chance for the label to demo this new process and offer samples of their growing stereo catalog. Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding's bits sprinkled throughout the program are excuses for various sound effects. On these segments, cross-channel panning is used to simulate movement across the sound stage. Stereo was a novelty that year, so the wider the spacial effect, the bigger the \"wow!\" factor.\n\nRANDOM NOTES\nOn \"B & R at the Castle\" we meet hunchbacked 'Gore' (Bob as Karloff) and 'Dr. Akhbar' (Bob doing Peter Lorre). He's Director of Bob and Ray Scientific Research and we're first shown Dr. A.'s experimental fly, 'Neil.'\n\nThe \"Minuet on the Rocks\" excerpt is boogiefied Paderewski, with Skitch pounding away at a honky tonk piano. Behind the creaky door of \"The Round Room  is a bagpipe marching band. Besides many unusual percussion instruments in the Schory's \"Buck Dance,\" we also hear tap shoes. Lena's \"New-Fangled Tango\" is a mono 'live' at the Waldorf performance that has the audience giggling. Within the ballroom on \"The Thing\" is a clock with a screaming human pendulum. \"Second Hungarian Rhapsody\" is an edited version of one of the most insane oompah band recordings ever made.\n\nRichard Leibert was Radio City's first-ever organist. His high output holiday song at the keys really gives your speakers a workout. If \"Song of the Volga Boatmen\" sounds like Glenn Miller, there's a good reason. Several Miller alumni play on this recreation of the original Bill Finegan arrangement. The experiments in Dr. A.'s \"Laboratory\" are samples from RCA's sound effects library.\n\nXavier's Cugat's fourth wife, Abbe Lane (\"Whatever Lola Wants\") is a Jewish girl from Brooklyn, born Abigail Lassman in 1932. \"The Ox Drivers\" reflects a popular trend of that day, folk music. Album-closing \"The End\" has shrunk-in-size Bob and Ray as the mad doctor's final experiment.\n\nPROGRAM\n\n[4:25] Bob and Ray Visit Dr. Ahkbar at the Castle\n[2:41] Riders in the Sky - George Melanchrino & his orch.\n[1:10] Minuet on the Rocks - Skitch Henderson & his orch.\n[2:23] Bob and Ray in the Round Room\n[2:29] Buck Dance - Dck Schory's New Percussion Ensemble\n[3:04] New-Fangled Tango (from the Broadway musical \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Happy-Hunting\/dp\/B00128VZKS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Happy Hunting<\/a>\") - Lena Horne\n[1:18] The Thing - Bob and Ray\n[2:07] Second Hungarian Rhapsody - Guckenheimer Sour Kraut Band\n[2:09] The First Nol - Dck Lebert at the Radio City Music Hall Organ\n[2:49] We'll Gather Lilacs in the Spring (from the London musical \"Perchance to Dream\") - Julie Andrews\n[3:28] Song of the Volga Boatman - Sauter-Finegan Orchestra\n[2:20] Bob and Ray in the Laboratory (Rifles; Surf; Cat Fight)\n[2:29] Whatever Lola Wants (from the Broadway musical \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Damn-Yankees\/dp\/B009RWUP4S\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Damn Yankees<\/a>\") - Abbe Lane w\/Tito Puente & his orch.\n[2:30] The Ox Drivers - The Belafonte Singers\n[2:10] The End - Bob and Ray\n\nTOTAL TIME: 37:32","280":"This album, Pickwick SPC 3274 from early-mid 1971 or so, is a gem of early Glen Campbell Capitol 45 singles' stiffs that pre-date his GENTLE ON MY MIND period.

The songs on this Lp, too, are the stereo versions, while the 45s were issued in mono.  If it counts for anything with these el cheapo junk bin parent bait (If you were a kid in the '60s, nagged your parents to bring home that new Beach Boys Capitol Records album, your cheap sneaky parents might go to the Woolworth's el cheapo bin instead and buy that wretched THE SURFSIDERS PLAY THE BEACH BOYS SONGBOOK junker on Design Records, instead of the real thing.  Parent bait.  So BAD it sounded like your parents bought guitars and recorded it in their garage, all in one botched take.  That BAD.), the \"original\" issue of this Pickwick album was pressed on a silver color label (round paper thing at the center of the vinyl Lp record), while it was re-pressed\/reissued on a black colored \"P\" logo label in the later 1970s.  Still a junk record.\n\nSongs:  \"Let Me Tell You 'Bout Mary,\" songwriter Bobby Bare, also recorded his version on 500 MILES AWAY FROM HOME, RCA\/Victor LPM\/LSP 2835 (January, 1964 Lp).  \"Can't You See I'm Tryin'\" (GC Capitol 5638, produced by Steve Douglas) shows songwriting credit to Jerry Fuller-Glen Campbell, and was an Lp track on the Knickerbockers' LIES Challenge 622 Lp, produced by Jerry Fuller ('natch), and recorded by the Forte Four on Decca 31979 45 single, produced by Gary Usher (again:  'natch), with Glen Campbell likely on session guitar on that record, also.\n\nPickwick was a junk\/budget bin label, but occasionally releases on such things featured obscure recordings not on those artists' regular full-list major label releases.  One I could recommend, of somewhat oblique Glen Campbell interest, is LOU RAWLS, COME ON IN MISTER BLUES, Pickwick SPC 3156, which is a comp of Lou Rawls pre-Lp Capitol 1962-ish 45 recordings, and in stereo, Merle Travis's \"Nine Pound Hammer\" with Glen Campbell in the session lineup.\n\nDating PC\/SPC Pickwick Lps:\n\n3\/6\/65:  3001-3012\n5\/29\/65:  3022-3024\n10\/02\/65:  3028-3040\n8\/27\/66:  3048-3054\n9\/28\/68:  3116-3133\n1\/31\/71:  3252 (JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR \"excerpts\" $1.89 album)\n7\/31\/71:  3273-3279\n10\/30\/71:  3288-3290\n7\/29\/72:  3307-3326\n8\/11\/73:  3344-3353\n8\/3\/74:  3381-3398\n\nPrior to mid-'68, Pickwick Lps were $1.98 mono list, $2.49 stereo.

The world appreciates such tremendous talent.","289":"I am not a polka person, but this song strikes a funny cord with me.

This product is not available (yet) in CD so I was pleased to find it available as an MP3 download here to play for my grandson. After I downloaded the songs I was very dismayed to find the music plays at a much slower speed and lower octave than the original vinyl. This obviously happened when the person or company who transferred the vinyl to digital used a slow playing turntable. Bob Keeshan's voice sounds like a low baritone in this download and the songs drag rather than zip along. I reported this to Amazon the next day and they refunded my money promptly and said they would \"report it\". This should be easy to fix and hopefully a treasured album will be \"perfect\" again, but until then avoid it!","297":"One of Maynard Ferguson's least jazzy albums was also one with the greatest general appeal. Some very pretty ballads and nice arrangements. The sound of this download version, however, is poorer than I could have made myself by running my old LP through commercial conversion software. This was made from a very worn LP with less than adequate conversion software, in my opinion. You may want to wait until a more sonically pure version is offered.","298":"I purchased this by mistake. I don't support artists who make a 'clean version' of a explicit offering.","299":"I bought this album because brahms no. 4 is one of my favorite, and so is bso. The amazon page lacks any description of conductor, time of performance etc. After downloading it i found the sound quality rather bad. From the other review I learned it's conducted by Charles Munch, and the time of performance must be 50 yrs ago. So this album must have been remastered from LP. I would rather buy an album more recent but sounds better. So be aware.","300":"Quite innovative! very pleasant relaxing music. I would be interested in listening to the others in this series. Will do it in due time.","301":"Over the years I have collected several dozen \"Oktoberfest\" albums. I am of German descent, and I love the classic beer hall music, and to my ears, this is the ONE album that really makes me feel that I an \"there\". Perhaps because this is the album I \"grew up with\" as a battered LP, this is my all time favorite of the genra. I had converted to old LP to cassette format, the burnit to a CD, then converted it to an MP3. You cannot imagine my delight when I found it available as a commercial MP3 dowload (minus all of the scratches, pops, and hiss). If you are looking for \"the one\" album of German beer drinking music, look no further - you have found it!","302":"Just when I thought I had heard all that Jimi and the Experience had brought us...","303":"While Noel Coward is highly entertaining, this recording was poorly done. There is a reason this album is less than $2 -- it sounds as if someone found an old vinyl record and set up the microphone to the speaker and recorded these MP3s from that. The recording is very scratchy just like on old vinyl LP. It also sounds like was recorded in mono. The high notes cause the headphones on my iPod to play static. The orchestra sounds flat, and there is no brilliance in Noel Coward's performance.\n\nThere is a reason that this has been put into two separate MP3s instead of individual tracks -- the first one is side A from the vinyl record and the second track is side B! Do not purchase this recording until it becomes remastered by the studio. I am highly disappointed by this.","304":"Great Tune!","305":"This is not about the album. It's about amazon not allowing me to listen to the album. It won't allow me to download, and when i tried to download the amazon music library, it downloaded the UK version! I can't find a way to return it and it's really aggravating. Amazon, get your stuff together. I'll delete this when the problem gets fixed.","306":"not so good sounding","307":"A solid trance EP that is hypnotic and otherworldly.  It casts a spell on the senses that conjures up sonic illusions rife with the smell of dry ice and the peripheral flash of lasers.","308":"I loved the music, but was disappointed by the fact that I was unable to separate the tunes, which are back-to-back on this CD\/MP3 complilation. That means I am unable to select the tunes individually, either as MP3s or as a CD which I had planned to burn. Also the fact that there are no details of recording dates or personnel. Apart from Cannonball Adderley, Johnny Coles and Gil Evans, I would have like to know who the rest of the band members were, particularly the trombone player who takes a solo. but these are minor complaints compared with the affordable cost.","309":"My music background is a one course music appreciation class. Nonetheless I have enough tonal sense to know what is good. This is an album I really have an appreciation for. For others who share my musical level this is a recommended album. I really envy those who really understand the music of Jazz.","310":"had the the vinyl years ago & now can enjoy it more, more often with less fuss with this excellent cd @ a wonderful price - thank you","311":"Classic performance by blues shouter Jimmy Rushing and the Count Basie band.","312":"I sent for the song \"song of India\" by Mario Lanza, I have listen to this song for over 50 years. It is one of my favorite songs.what you sent me is not by Mario Lanza.

This version has very clumsy edits that remove over a minute's worth of music, which destroys the flow of the music.","316":"This recording has only 4 of the 6 stanzas. An incomplete song rendition. WTH!","317":"The preview for \"Good King Wenceslas\" showed me that they left out some of the lyrics. I'm disappointed, and certainly will get neither this song nor this album.","318":"The cover was busted","319":"sound is bad","320":"Many years ago I had and 8 track tape of the Morman Tab. choir---This was my favorite song and I have wondered many times about it. Now I find that what I came up w here is nothing the same---unrecognizable. Dont want it and am trying to give it back!","321":"Terrible sound quality. That really dims any of the musical charms.","322":"Awesome","323":"Very old sound. Very poor quality.","324":"The actual title of the song is When Day is Done (not Gone).  Smooth as silk, Clint delivers a very romantic song in a vintage style that gets your heart yearning for that special someone.","325":"It's a disgrace that Amazon as actually charging money for this amateurish reclamation of an Lp.  It's poorly transferred: lots of residual clicks and other artifacts, and, worst of all, it's been put through a limiter!  What a disappointment.\n\nShame on you, Amazon.\n\nF. Reeder","326":"Ok, loved the record.  Bought this mp3 album thinking I could get closer to the old Capitol master tapes.  Listened to a few samples; sounded reasonable, but the samples aren't full fidelity.  Downloaded the album, only then to discover it was dubbed from a well-worn LP.  I was quite disappointed!  Now, it is GREAT music, and if you don't have it in any format, then its hard to go wrong at $6.99.  But, the album is still common enough in flea markets if you have a record player.  So I have it two stars; great music, disappointing recording.","327":"I gave this 5 stars, because it's such a great album...but, the first reviewer was correct... quality is tolerable and better than not having it at all.\n\nTHIS IS THE BEST CHRISTMAS ALBUM YOU'LL EVER HEAR OR LOVE! As amazing as it is...you deserve the best possible copy\/quality of this recording as you can get!!! For now, that appears to be on used vinyl. This download will do for now and is probably worth the money to download, but, with any luck, someone will find the masters and make us fans, all happy! However, this download will save you the bother of doing the transfer from vinyl yourself until a better quality download or edition on CD comes along!\n\nThe title cut, \"Christmas Is For The Family\" and \"I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day\" are cult Christmas classics that are revered by Christmas music fans and a mandatory addition to their collection after you've heard them the first time. I've never heard another rendition of either song done so perfectly. You'll love these two and they will easily make it into your Christmas music rotation. Frankly, either or both should have been released as a singles but, the label (Design Records) was not a \"single\" oriented label. Their catalog pertains to popular artists singing songs that are lesser known than their hits or their early recordings after an artist made it big or accomplished singers\/musicians doing covers of big tunes. Needless to say, some of these LP's, like this one were destined to become classics. Had \"Christmas Is For The Family\" or \"I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day\" been released as singles the year this LP was released, either would have done very well and would now be staples of Christmas music rotation on radio airwaves both local free and satelite radio and more than likely given Bing Crosby's \"White Christmas\" a run for it's money as the biggest selling Christmas records of all time. \"May Santa Fill Our Hearts\" is another cut on this LP that is another cult classic, and I've never heard another cover of the song. There is some great original material on this LP as well as standards.\n\nOn \"Christmas Is For The Family\", side one is \"Popular\" Christmas Classics with stunning lush arrangements wrapped around Dennis Day's voice with full studio orchestra, featuring Lou Hollingsworth at the Wurlitzer Organ, and the Vail Boys Choir. Side two is more of a \"Traditional\" Christmas Classics that you might hear in Church, mostly done with Lou at the Organ and the boys choir again, in arrangements to stir emotions in even the coldest of souls at Christmas Time.\n\nJack Benny's appearance as \"Santa\" playing the violin on the cover, as well as Jack playing, speaking and singing at the begining and the end of side one and the beginning of side two and another little cameo at the end is a nice bit of nostalgia from when Dennis used to appear regularly on Jack's Television Show that I'm sure was designed to boost LP sales.\n\nNow, aside from that, this is the finest Christmas album you'll ever hear from a man with a voice that was a gift that was meant to sing Christmas Songs, Irish Folk Songs, as well as be shared with the masses.\n\nI am on my 3rd pressing of this Christmas Classic and 4 years ago, I spent over a month, finding pristine copies of this LP to give as Christmas gifts to members of my family who have fond memories of Christmas due to this fine recording.\n\nUnfortunately, IT'S NOT available on CD, YET! I just wish someone could find the masters and have enough sense to re-release it so we can all enjoy this amazing Christmas Classic. Until such time, you'll have to do like I did...get one coverted to CD to get you by till the real thing comes along.","328":"I was thrilled to finally see this recording (which has been part of my Christmas tradition on vinyl and CD-R) available for download.\n\nHOWEVER, the downloaded recording is wretched.  It has more pops and clicks than my 45 year old record.\n\nAmazon should be ashamed.","329":"This probably deserves more stars but the announcer is such a slimy bastard that I can't stand to listen to this.  I am not a Herman expert, but I would not suspect that this is his strongest work.  But I can't listen long enough to find out.","330":"Loved this song as a child on my mother's album.  Great to find it again.","331":"A 2003 release in an all-instrumental series on the Sona Rupa label of India\/UK. All of the albums have similar instrumentation; this one features 2 players of the bansuri (bamboo) flute which makes it especially attractive for me. Other instruments are sarod, sitar, santoor, sarangi, shenai, and tabla and pakhwaj drums. The notes say that the recording was done 'live' with all the musicians together. Acoustic guitar and keyboard are used sparingly.\n\nIf you like one album in this series, you'll like them all (I have about 10). Instrumental songs which are rooted in classical musics of India (the raag of each is noted), but given contemporary ensemble arrangements, slightly like what you'd hear in a western jazz ensemble with the 'head' of the song and multiple solos. The resulting songs, most less than 10 minutes, are probably more accessible to the uninitiated western listener than the 'pure classical' musics of India.","332":"I got this album in India and I love I dian Music,  but this although not in a classical style it is very, very nice\nthe artist team are the best ones.\nI lament the are not more of this same group and  arrenger.","333":"Great song","334":"I've been keeping an ear on this group fo a while. These new tracks are more pop than previous work. As usual, Jay's vocals are incredible. This is very strong stuff. I expect to see a lot more of these guys as word gets around. Highly recommended.","335":"I love his music.","336":"enjoyed this album. he's different than what anyone else is making, so it's a nice change from the monotony. but it.","337":"Well I heard this song glee and I absolutely love it. I just had to buy it!","338":"Helped open me up to a new world of music and I absolutely love the show and the songs they sing.","339":"When it does come down to it, the cast of Glee has done some really pathetic covers. When I heard them recently do a cover of Whitney Houston's I Look To You, I really thought that they just really killed the rawness and the intimate appeal of the song. They've done the same idea when they've mixed two rock classics together into one song, by mixing Bon Jovi's Livin' On A Prayer, and the classic Rolling Stones anthem Start Me Up, it feels like the killjjoy of 2 die hard fans into one badly made opus. It feels like the songs from the Rock Of Ages musical feel like a better novelty to listen to than what the cast of Glee has done with beautiful songs. I also think the producers of Glee should try and deliver more original songs than the feeling of covers being more like gags with crescent rolls.\n\nSong: F-","340":"JINGLE BELLS (MCA-15012) is a 1980 MCA reissue of a\n1956 DECCA Guy Lombardo & his Royal Canadians LP (DL 8354).\nThe playlist is unchanged from that original version.\n\nSIDE ONE\n[2:07] Jingle Bells - v\/ Kenny Gardner & the Lombardo Trio\n[1:51] Santa Claus is Comin' to Town - v.\/ Kenny Gardner & the Lombardo Trio\n[2:40] Winter Wonderland - v.\/the Andrews Sisters\n[2:44] The Merry Christmas Waltz - v.\/ Kenny Gardner\n[2:44] I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus - v.\/ Richard Geary\n[2:34] Christmas Chopsticks ('Twas the Night Before Christmas)\n\nSIDE TWO\n[2:58] White Christmas - v.\/ Tony Craig\n[2:15] Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer - v.\/ Kenny Gardner & the Lombardo Trio\n[2:37] Christmas Candles - v.\/ the Andrews Sisters\n[2:30] Frosty the Snow Man - v.\/ Kenny Gardner & the Lombardo Trio\n[3:13] ('Round The) Christmas Tree at Home - v.\/Kenny Martin\n[2:54] He'll Be Coming Down the Chimney (Like He Always Did Before) - v.\/ Kenny Gardner & the Lombardo Trio\n\nTOTAL TIME: 31:07","341":"song has a scratching sound in the beginning which is not part of the original recording.

While I have about 50 Mantovani LP albums, most from my parent's collection and some purchased used, most do not have dates printed on them anywhere.  The current best source of album listings that I have found is at[...].  Wikipedia's Mantovani page lists 2 additional Christmas albums: Christmas Carols, London LL 913; and Merry Christmas to All of You, Decca 66445009 (1963).  I cannot find any other references to either of these albums anywhere.  There is an extensive LP (and even old 78s) listing on the mantovani-orchestra(dot)com site, but it does not include many US albums that I own and it appears that the catalog numbers there are non-US.\n================================================================","346":"Poor quality.

It includes an album-sized four page booklet, \"Of Bells and Carillons,\" from which comes much of the trivia here.\n\nThe RCA and Coca-Cola pavilions were close neighbors at the Fair. Victor's John Klein was also musical director for Coke and the Carillonneur of their pavilion's centerpiece, what was then the world's largest carillon: a 120-foot tower housing 610 chimes capable of many different tones: Flemish bells, Harp, Lute, Aeolian, Baroque, Celestial and several others.\n\nThe original carillons were far simpler devices that required many ringers to operate a few roped bells that weighed tons. Modern carillons are electro-mechanical marvels controlled by keyboards, stops and pedals, their sounds created by miniature bronze bells weighing mere ounces instead of pounds or tons. The secret is a series of audio amplifiers and speakers. The Coca-Cola carillon had 57 directional speakers (stentors), some five-feet across, that projected 3,000 watts of amplified sound.\n\nPrincipal recordings for \"All Around the Christmas Tree\" of Henry Ren&eacute;'s orchestra and chorus were made at Webster Hall in NYC. Master tapes, equipment and engineers then relocated to Flushing Meadow, Queens and the Coke pavilion, where Mr. Klein added his bells on a separate tape track. The results are nothing less than remarkable, what sounds like a concert of perfectly blended orchestra, voices and carillon.\n\nOne of the most unique holiday albums ever, this one gets a highest recommendation!\n\nSIDE ONE\n[3:45] Silent Night; O Little Town of Bethlehem; We Wish You a Merry Christmas\n[2:59] All Around the Christmas Tree\n[2:45] Sleigh Ride\n[3:15] Joy to the World; Adeste Fideles; Hark!

It originally appeared in the 50s on a monaural LP (Capitol T-9013).  It is that edition which I found at Amazon (Sold by Looney Geeks).  Given the rarity of the recording, one must be prepared to accept pops and crackles, and there are a goodly sprinkling of those throughout both sides.  The sound, of course, is typical of the early days of high fidelity.  That said, the record is well worth owning if you can find a copy.  The carols are played with deep and heart-felt simplicity, with no fancy arranging.  The chimes are very well used to accentuate the simple directness of Biggs' interpretations of a goodly selection of the most beloved carols.  The only drawback with regard to the copy I received is that it was plainly advertised as an audio CD (which obviously it is not).  I had fully expected the item to be a remake by someone from the original vinyl, and am somewhat disappointed that such was not the case.  By and large, though, the quality of the disc is quite acceptable although the price ($24.95) iwas a bit steep, given that the disc is not in pristine condition.  Nevertheless, if you can find one, BUY IT!","353":"I love the song Barely Breathing!","354":"Doesn't seem to be the full score. Songs are incomplete and some seem to be cut out altogether. Not too happy with this purchase.","355":"Although there is no information about this recording on Amazon, I believe it is the 1962 D'Oyly Carte version originally issued on vinyl as London OSA 1248. At the time it was the the best recording you could buy. However, presumably due to the constraints imposed by 4 sides of vinyl, the Finale is missing four verses starting with \"Having been a wicked baronet a week.\" I really missed them at the time since they are among my favorite parts: who wouldn't like \"For to settle in the town of Basingstoke.\" I was hoping that this rerelease would include the missing material, but it does not.\n\nI have ripped my own vinyl and I was also hoping this would be a cleaner version, but its not. The sound quality is quite poor.\n\nI wish that someone would find the missing verses (they must have been recorded) and clean up the sound and re-rerelease this. That effort would likely produce the best Ruddigore available.","356":"I thought I would get the whole album for 0.89 not one song!!","357":"Excellent part of the Bethoven Symphony 7 Op 92 Allegro part","358":"This is a rare, and beautiful album of orchestral magic which George Melachrino recorded in stereo for the wonderful RCA in 1958. This is part of a set of several albums he did for RCA including Music for: Reading, Relaxation, Dining and so on, and were some of RCA's very FIRST popular stereo albums (LSP 1000,1001,1002).... WELL, one's hopes are dashed. This is a bad needle drop transfer, and tracks 2-6 have been so badly recorded that they are not listenable. What is this Hallmark company, and WHAT are they doing?  I suggest a few weeks with Mike Dutton to learn how to do PROPER musical transfers. The musical material merits 5 STARS, the transfer 0,  so it has to get a 2.","359":"I was skeptical when I heard about this compilation of music because, as a huge RUSH fan, I expected it to really fall short. Apparently DARKSTAR originally had a bunch of great, classic RUSH songs as the soundtrack, and due to some crappy Hollywood greed tactics by Universal, the Producers dumped the idea and replaced the songs with their own, custom scored music. It is amazing, and truly lives up to the expectations one would expect of a AAA touring act. The music ranges from eerie, ambient tracks to full out rockers.  Jimmy Pitts on keyboards is epic, his style more aligned to virtuosic guitar work like you'd expect from Vai, but the guitar neck laid out on a table for the talented Pitts to burn up with hand-played arpeggios and leads that seem impossible on keyboards. Likewise, Bill Bruce is phenomenal with his tasteful passages, grinding rhythms, and signature classical guitar riffs mixed with well written layered leads.  If you're a fan of Vai, Zappa, TSO, Rush, Yes, and all progressive, this is the record for you.","360":"I couldn't believe Amazon is selling this.  This is CLEARLY A HOME-MADE TYPE COVER and SONG LISTING - and ITUNES DOESN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE SONGS - ITunes just lists TRACK #s.  What's going on?!","361":"Delightful version of this song.","362":"I have about fifty hour-plus long meditation\/relaxation mp3's from various composers and this one is the VERY BEST...by far.\nOther selections by the same artist aren't as good for me, but this one is excellent. Highly recommend!","363":"It simply wouldn't open in Windows 7.","364":"This is a Classic Country Swing Song that is as good today as ever! I think this is the best song the Wilburns ever did and I think even Ernest Tubb did it in his own fashion. Get up and Swing dance with this song!","365":"Fats Domino was as meaningful as any other artist (except perhaps for Buddy Holly) in my early music appreciation days. I didn't have a lot of 45s in those years but there was more Fats than anyone. He remains a great favorite.\nTwo things led me to buying this single. One was that I never have owned it and as such had never heard the B side until I bought an ACE Fabulous Flips compilation years back. I don't have nearly the 45s I used to but I do have a jukebox to feed. The other is that \"Before I Grow Too Old\" is not on the 4 disc Imperial box. A sad oversight.\nI rank \"Before I Grow Too Old\" in my top 10 Fats Domino songs. If  you still play 45s, seek this single out. The A side is no slouch either. If not I recommend the ACE Fabulous Flips Vol. 3","366":"Relaxing and better than that Free!!!!!\nIt helps calm you if you've had a stressful day. Great product and would buy more","367":"love","368":"I like the song","369":"Beautiful song. I really love Holly Star..amazing voice to God's word. I listen to this song over and over.  Great song!","370":"I love love this song. A true worshipper","371":"I was looking for the song that they sing in White Christmas. This is a studio version, not the version in the movie. Not even close. Very bummed. I listened to the sample and it sounded like the correct version, but after buying it I now know better.","372":"Awesome","373":"An upbeat version, great for zumba class! Fun to dance to!  Love it!!! I would recommend it to all those fitness gals out there!","374":"My brother is going to flip when he opens this gift...We had a lot of these songs on tape that we used to listen to on record or in the car when we were little kids with my mom.  My mom just passed away this October.  This gift will mean so much to my brother!\nThank you!","375":"The mp3 listings on this album are scrambled!  The song I wanted was. \"He Lifts Me Higher\".  I got the song by downloading \"When Was The Last Time\".  A disservice to John Bowman, who is a fantastic singer.  Someone should correct.","376":"great album ...","377":"not as good as LIVIN","378":"was advertised in good condition, the cd was scratched and I am not able to hear the song i wanted","379":"Glad does it again with their awesome vocals and inspiring arrangements. I recommend all their acappella albums.","380":"Awesome worship song to God be the glory","381":"My listening audience loves this worship song.  It is requested very often.  If I change it, I get calls for more.","382":"Thank you for this very spiritual song.  It is uplifting with biblical lyrics.","383":"One of the most uplifting songs","384":"Ok","385":"Although I've heard this music performed by an orchestra almost every Christmastime, the Quartetto Gelato version is a delightfully different and spirited rendition of this classic portion of The Nutcracker Suite.  As usual, the quality of Amazon's download is superior to any CD or DVD recording.","386":"A great song download.","387":"Uplifting!","388":"Fabulous talent great music.","389":"great","390":"These are the songs of old that tug at my heart and I like this group as they are sincere !","391":"Cause it's a pretty song and I had been looking everywhere for this song when I found it on Amazon I just had to have it so glad you had it.","392":"I bought this mp3 thinking that it was a song. But its not a song it's just him preaching","393":"Poet Voices have created a wondeful collection of songs as only the PVs can do.  I really enjoyed the mixing of different musical styles with Southern Gospel Music.  The best version of Sweeter as The Days Go By that  I have ever heard.","394":"This is what I didn't need","395":"This song is based on my favorite Psalm (121). The first time I heard it I cried! The combination of the strong voice and the beautiful music bring out the power of the words. Reminds me that the Lord will always take care of me","396":"Beautiful song!","397":"Great","398":"this song really expresses the true meaning of Christmas It is a comforting song to listen to and Carrol Roberson does a great job with it I listen to it over and over both during the Christmas season and all through the year","399":"Love Carroll Robertson!  Love this song!  I was so upset the first Christmas I realized I couldn't listen to this any longer since I no longer had a cassette tape player to play it!  Beautiful song, great lyrics! Gotta love digital!  Go ahead, buy it!  You know you want to!  You'll be glad you did!","400":"Awesome","401":"No complaints","402":"awesome","403":"Very good very slept on crew led by Menace 2 Society actor Saafir the Saucee' Nomad they are all very talented creative rhymers the beats range from hard to harder and mellow as for the hobos the rip through the tracks leatherface with a brand new chainsaw I tell you if rappers achieved success from pure talent alot of these guys on the radio would be in trouble if your a head pic this up you won't be disappointed","404":"I really like up beat Southern Gospel. I had never heard of this group but I enjoyed this song very much.","405":"Baldhead Rick has been on records since 94 or 95 but this is only his 2nd solo.\nIt would be rare to find this you should deffo pick up the mp3-at this price it's a steal.\nOne of the rare cd's where i didn't skip a song and the quality is so good.\nThere are a few club bangers,couple of sex songs and sick gangsta songs-love this album.\nPlenty of guest features too-Cellski,Cougnut(r.i.p),San Quinn,Ad kapone,C-Fresh all the frisco rap vets.\nCan't believe i'm the first to review-buy it and im sure you will post your own!!","406":"I really like this song. I liked the original and I like this cover\/remix as well. Sounds really nice. Is this actually Passion Pit?","407":"I came across this by accident because I was hoping to find a live version from Kenny Wayne Shepherd because I've heard him do this song live twice & he does an incredible job. This version by Scott Finch is very decent, but seems a little uninspired. The guitar work is great, but just isn't quite there, and the singing is certainly missing in spots, however, this is a very decent version and is well worth $ .99. I'd give this a 3.5 if I could, but it doesn't deserve a 3 because it is better than that.","408":"Smoke Dreams is one of my favorite records, and Ronnie Deauville was a great singer. But what you can hear on this CD and the identical iTunes album is an absolutely unacceptable work. Processing the sound on my Mac, I had to increase the speed by 10% to match the real speed of my LP. And removing the clicks was a quite simple job to do, so I wonder why it couldn't be done when preparing this CD for release. If you are looking for this album, better try to find an original LP.","409":"It's hard to believe an MP3 download this bad is offered at amazon.  It's obvious this is merely a transfer from a vinyl disc and the record player is running pretty darn slow!  This isn't a bad album for those that remember it from Welk's mid-1950's Coral releases with the likes of Alice Lon, Lennon Sisters, Larry Hooper, Larry Dean, etc., but goodness...if you're going to offer the thing, let's get it right!!  Alice Lon sounds rather like Larry Hooper, Welk's bass singer!","410":"If you are going to buy one CD this year, buy this one. There is a song for every situation in life and it is my \"go to\" CD for: parties, intimate dinners, time alone with a glass-or two--of wine, get togethers with friends, when i want to dance. Phoebe Legere's vocals melt my heart and her musicianship is stellar. I saw one other reviewer referred to Phoebe as a \"National Treasure.\" Agree for sure but let's up the ante to \"International Treasure.\" Phoebe makes me want to sing, dance, learn to play piano and start speaking French. I adore her talent.","411":"Already had all the songs and the extras but had to have this as part of the collection. Don't understand a lick of French but that's ok. The tunes are enough to get you in. I like some more than others but happy enough to give it a listen through all the way.","412":"I don't remember this song, so it probably sucks.","413":"Great","414":"good song","415":"Not what I was expecting. . . it doesn't offer advice. Wish I hadn't bought it.","416":"After Julian Casablanca's recent solo album, I was hungry for more, and stumbled on this track. What a great song! It's short and rocking, definitely more guitar driven(and sounds more like a pumped-up Strokes song) than his solo album. Though it's a Christmas song, this will stay in my playlist all year. Here's hoping there's more where this came from....","417":"well produced.","418":"Outstanding vintage Springsteen.","419":"It is only 52 seconds","420":"Awful Quality for this song. I thought it would be better.","421":"I love this song. And the movie and before that the TV series,  I  have made a CD of this song and many other old and new family friendly songs for all of our road trip we take all summer long. Is a great CD when traveling with the grand kids for sure. We all sing the songs together and talk about our favorite parts of the movie or show the song comes from. We are making new memories associated with the songs on my traveling CD. Very nice to have when you cant get reception on the radio in some places and we never have to worry about songs being inappropriate for the kids. This was a great idea and so glad I thought of it. Happy travels for us, we will enjoy these songs for years to come. as many songs on it has been around for years already it is great to share with the kids","422":"wonderful, rich and lush","423":"Don't let the name \"Foetus\" fool you--when I was first recommended Thirlwell's music, I though it was going to be some terrible goth or metal nonsense.  How wrong I was.\n\nEveryone who knows me knows that I am almost pathologically obsessed with Thirlwell's musical output.  Despite his proclivity it seems like nobody knows who he is--and even when you find a Foetus fan (usually online) discussing his music they focus on some of his older stuff, like NAIL or HOLE.  The problem here is not that Thirlwell got worse over time--the problem is is that he attracted lot of fans of the overly broad designation of \"industrial music.\"  The result is that many of those that do know who he is cling to the era when his sound was closer to early \"industrial\" and noise music.\n\nIf there is anything Thirlwell is not, it is being an artist that has the same sound over his entire career.  In some ways it's hard to believe that the same genius that created NAIL also produced this fantastic orchestral brilliance.  In fact, the Thirlwell of the past--usually wearing some guise, most famously the  \"Clint Ruin\" persona--seems radically different from the Thirlwell we see today.  Compare the pictures of Thirlwell back then standing amid impaled hog heads to him in a suit conducting for a live performance of Manorexia.  Thirlwell has never been content to stay in the same place.\n\nEvery Thirlwell album, then, is a delightful new surprise, and I had waited for this album in near-agony, and the delays only compounded by impatience.  Remember how excited you used to get near Christmas back during your childhood?  That's how I felt waiting for this album to finally arrive into my mailbox, except in this case, Christmas was delayed at least twice due to Santa Claus to finally get his sleigh painted the right color before leaving the North Pole. (This metaphor makes sense only to those that followed the delays of this album).  A little voice inside me wondered how Thirlwell could top LOVE, and how I'd probably be disappointed after all that waiting, because I'm just negative that way.  Foetus isn't often very uplifting to listen to, so I suppose I can be forgiven for my pessimism.  Fortunately, I was glad I was wrong--this may be Thirlwell's best album yet, and it's probably my favorite.  He took what made LOVE so good and made it even better.\n\nHIDE is a concept album with held together by the themes of fear, paranoia, and uncertainty; lyrical references throughout are apocalyptic (particularly \"Oilfields\") and numerous references to fear-stirring events that were current during the album's production (e.g., \"anthrax in the envelope\"), and it seems that Thirlwell envisioned the album as being the sountrack to a movie that exists only within his own head--which is something you may expect from an artist that already outputs fantastic cinematically-inspired pieces (check out Manorexia!) and has expressed a desire to score for a big-budget movie. Cosmetics, for example, comes across as a bombastic, operatic opening while O Putrid Sun sounds like something that would play to rolling credits after a downer of an ending.  Throughout Thirlwell adeptly mixes \"haunting\" with \"beautiful\" and does so over a large range of style.  I'll let other reviewers go more in-depth over the individual songs, they're better at describing them than I am.\n\nAlso, I forgot to describe the cover art.  For a lack of proper adjectives I'll close this review by stating that it's \"pretty friggin' awesome,\" which you can see for yourself.","424":"Great music, fuzzy sound quality. So, no dice on this one.","425":"I have this excellent LP and my copy is in good shape. Have transfered it into a CD and now I thought I was buying a \"Digitally Remastered\" CD transfer, as it was announced at the site. Should have stayed with my non-remastered copy that is much, really much better than this copy. I can' really believe this was remastered, otherwise the copied LP is in an awful shape and, again, should not have been used for commercial purposes. Avoid it and wait for a decent copy.","426":"This is another muddy scratchy LP transfer this company is trying to pawn off as \"remastered\"  It's a shameless attempt to turn a buck. Do yourself a favor and get the LP. The music is wonderful and features Antonio Carlos Jobim on guitar listed as \"Tony Brazil\"","427":"This supposedly remastered release seems to have been made from a very scratchy LP. Some of the noise was digitally reduced, but mostly it's there in the form of a constant crunchy sound that distracts from the music.\n\nPerhaps the tapes were lost, but they surely could have found a better copy to do this reissue from. They also misidentified at least some of the titles. Avoid.","428":"Amazon, I attempted to download this track 3 days ago and it didn't work and told me to contact you.\n\nI then got an email saying you're working on it but still haven't heard from you or received a follow-up.\n\n$0.99 is no biggie to me, but principle is.\n\nRight now, you're failing in that principle.","429":"Subtle yet very powerful. I love it!!","430":"Another great EP from FOF.  The guys know how to deliver powerful alternative rock to classic carols.\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n-Guitars operate on FOF's well known grand scale, creating great audio landscapes, especially on \"Do you hear what I hear?\"-------really feel like a shepherd out on that incredible night.\n-Instrumental track isn't a simply filler, but is really a great intro into the epic rendition of \"Pie Jesu\".  Works great.\n-Nice balance between symphonic guitars, acoustic, vocals and piano.  \"Angels We Have Heard on High\" has a kind of coffee house feel to it, and then \"The Earth Stood Still\" nearly brings tears to your eyes.  Amazing musical diversity between 6 tracks.\nDRAWBACKS:\n-4 stars only because it's an EP--------------I guess if you combine it with the 1st \"Advent\", you kind of have a full-length Christmas album.  It's just short, and you're thirsting for more by the end of \"Pie Jesu\".\n\nOverall, great EP.  Perfect for listening in and out of the season.","431":"One of my old favorites.","432":"Excellent","433":"wish this was on cd not just a download  more words required why, this is getting worse buy the word !","434":"The music from the game was great; it really fit the gameplay.  This is a comprehensive soundtrack including all of it.","435":"One listen and you'll understand why it won so many awards. It will literally transport you to another world. Can't listen to it eoungh.","436":"Not the version I was looking for","437":"RA was such an underrated band. This is a great Rock song hard guitars, good drums, Great melodic Vocals!! all around great song from a great Band!!","438":"Great album","439":"the first 20 seconds of the version of this song has a very high pitched tick-tick-tick sound (not in a cool way) and is very annoying.  I did not want to hear this version repeately.  The first time was enough. Unfortunately the sample music of this version does not play the song from the very beginning, so I did not see this coming.  I basically need to throw out this version of the song off my playlist, waste $1 and try to forget about the time wasted to download this song, etc.  Hope you guys purchase a different version and not run into the same mistake I did.","440":"Not gonna lie.... pretty shallow, boring and definitely not enough.... well anything really. The songs are all too short and underdeveloped. There are hints of something but it never quite breaks through. Generic would be a good word for this album.","441":"Prior to listening to this album I read a few reviews. About half of the reviews themselves were positive and half were negative. But the comments were 90% negative, made up of people ripping this band apart for any reason from a lack of originality to their cocky personalities off-stage to their cookie-cutter image. This band must have upset quite a few people in their quest for fame.\n\nThe EP itself starts off alright. The chanting at the beginning of the first track made me a little excited, but as soon as the lead singer came in, I was immediately turned off. His voice is extremely nasally. It's a good thing that the EP is only 14 minutes (not a single song over the 3 minute mark), because his voice is painful. The guitarwork, drumming, and keyboards are all great, and it's a shame that they have such a terrible singer. I'd really like to love this band since their name comes from one of my favorite childhood movies Three Ninjas, but I just CANNOT get over how annoying his voice is.","442":"This album is sick nasty! I've been a fan before they even got signed! cannot wait to hear more from these guys, I don't regret buying this album at all, I love every single second of it :]","443":"This was purchased as a gift. Everything looks and works as advertised. I would have heard back by now if there were any problems. They loved this gift!","444":"The best!!","445":"I love live recordings but this one felt more like a hack job to me. It is early 70s and early in Springsteen's career so maybe I got what I paid for.","446":"You can rarely go wrong with early Springsteen.  This was written 30+ years ago as the song of a frustrated young man.  Now in 2012 it is haunting as it reminds us of what a super storm took away from the Jersey shore.  Like most poets, what Springsteen writes transcends one meaning and can be applied to so many more experiences.","447":"ok just ok","448":"This version is far too sanitized and emotionless.  Lacks the limited depth of the original.","449":"Good backgrounds and instrumentals. Could not use it for performances. Was not what I expected. Quick shipping and good experience with ordering. But would not purchase again.","450":"Excellent quality","451":"Great album, Great sound\nJamaica, Queens, New York native Lloyd Banks the best underrated artist the same as 50 Cent and all other New York music artist that makes the best sound. Hunger For More 2 is like the coolest album I ever listen from Lloyd Banks, from between Hunger For More that first album of his also cool as well.","452":"Good 3rd album from Banks, he rebounded after the disappointing 2nd album...a little too much guest features for my taste, but good album overall.","453":"Great artist, great song!!!  I will probably purchase more songs from this artist!!!! Gets me in a positive mood when I listen to it!!","454":"I thought this was the original versionnot as good. Easy to understand the lyrics though which is nice for the kids when they are trying to sing along.","455":"OMG! This is a great CD. These two women's voices melt together like butter on a biscuit. I love the songs they sing like angels. They cover some classics that give you memories of holidays gone by. This is a great CD to play at your holiday parties and get you into the Holiday spirit.","456":"This cd was shipped promptly and it was in excellent condition. Great! everything I expected . I was very pleased with this shipment.","457":"Excellent!","458":"Album from 1958 by the brilliant flamenco guitarist Sabicas (1912-90), which (as far as I'm aware) has never appeared on CD.\n\nTracks 2 & 4 and 6-9 are songs by Enrique Montoya; the Danza Mora is a guitar solo, transcribed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Selected-Solos-for-Guitar-by-Sabicas-Escudero\/dp\/B001EULSTW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Selected Solos for Guitar by Sabicas & Escudero<\/a>&nbsp;(Hansen, 1962).  The others are guitar duets with either Sabas's brother Diego or Mario Escudero.  Anita Ramos provides castanets.\n\nTrack 9 is mislabelled a Granadina; it is in fact a Sole (track 6 is a Granadina)\n\nBut this album was recorded in stereo, and Amazon's samples sound to me like mono!  Ecchh.  It's like listening through a hole in the wall.  In my opinion you'd be better off with the stereo LP (ABC-Paramount ABCS-239).","459":"This soundtrack has perhaps the worst rendition of \"natural\" water pounds that I have ever heard. The alleged ocean waves are very static-y and sound more like fluctuating pink noise. The disturbing effects that are produced will more than negate any benefits from the gamma wave beat.","460":"This review features the song Night and Day, from the album:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Vintage-Music-No-136-LP-Jo-Stafford\/dp\/B004ASZXFU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Vintage Music No. 136 - LP: Jo Stafford<\/a>\n\nBesides being a great melody this one captures the essence of Eros I thought.

Best wishes for Christmas and the year to come.","461":"A lovely souvenir of the superb Rise Stevens in really wonderful music you can absolutely wallow in","462":"Purchased on Amazon app, which doesn't give track time.  I was looking for the 7 minute version. Guess I'll be using the desktop version from now on.","463":"Liked it","464":"Live version. Not what I wanted","465":"Can't understand anything he's saying","466":"Did not like it at all. This album left me wanting a more traditional Holiday album. Do not recommend it.","467":"Great album by the always funny Iliza!  I purchased this album after buying War Paint and seeing her live and I'm happy I did.  If you are a fan of her's, pick this up and go see her live!!!","468":"Robin Laing is an excellent and productive folksinger from the South of Scotland. His voice is beautiful, his coverage of traditional material is inventive, and his songwriting is excellent and thought provoking. Brilliant.","469":"I fell in love with Nadia Ali's haunting and magical voice with Rapture back in 2001.  And just when you thought Rapture couldn't get better -- the Aviccii new generation remix blows your mind away.  I think I listened to that track about 10 times before I could move to others in this album!  Fantastic, once again.  Looking forward to the Diamond Edition!","470":"I love Dance Hall Music..\nGot this to tie me over until I am\nReady for the rest of this Album.\nI-Rie","471":"I admit I'm a big fan of Michael McGlynn's voice, his writing and arrangements so I may not be totally objective here. This is a simple, plaintive and gentle melody and that's exactly why it works. For me, it captures the innocence of children and the Christmas season that we all wish we could recreate. This song is worthy of more attention. Michael could sing the phonebook and I'd listen. It's an example of how less is often more and a fine example of the ease with which Michael's voice flows throughout his range. It may disappoint those wanting to hear more of Anuna, (though their soft back-up is just right here in my opinion.)","472":"I love the song but I purchased the wrong one. this one has talking at the end of it. so I won't listen to it. this one is live so to me it ruined it","473":"I ordered it by mistake I don't have any way to play a cd that uses a device uses mp3 player","474":"This song was really great! Until of course it suddenly ended in the middle of it. It sounds like its been ripped from a mix but would they really sell it like that? Either way, expect a sudden, unexplainable ending at 7:40\n\nEDIT: I see now that it is an edit from the original mix, but it is still cut off at a terrible point. I'd rather they had cut the first 3 minutes out and had the next three in since the beginning doesn't even sound like that actual song.","475":"This is cd is full of upbeat, sophisticated music.  The lyrics are thoughtful.  the music is full of catchy rhythms and expertly mixes a variey of instruments including guitar,trumpet,and saxophone.  I enjoyed all of the songs, but for those of you looking for an upbeat positive and dancable song, I suggest trying Top of the World.  Finally a CD of creative music not written for tweens!!!  I highly recommend you check Matt Rodela's music out.","476":"Absolutely terrible. I watched it all the way through, but it was an effort.  I don't like music where screaming makes up a large percentage of the vocals.  They have several songs that I do like, but they're not on this dvd.  I gave it away.  If you want to see a great concert that you'll watch over & over, get Shinedown's \"Somewhere in the Stratosphere\" 4 disc set.  Nothing short of amazing.  And that boy can sing.","477":"class cd great service","478":"Easy download on Amazon Cloud","479":"Very sexy music.","480":"LOVE this song. . .one of my favorites, just wish Scotty Moore would have had his guitar to give us the solos that are among some of the best!  Sorry, Elvis. . .Scotty should have been playing lead guitar for this one!!","481":"I bought this (and another of their Christmas albums) based on a couple YouTube videos.  The quality on the videos was much better than the quality of the albums.  I was hoping these would become a family favorite, but they were generally considered so-so by the family.  Oh well!","482":"An&uacute;na's first Christmas album, \"Christmas Songs,\" did not contain one track that failed to deliver the group's signature haunting choral arrangement of folk, ecclesiastical, traditional and classical\/ancient pieces.  Listening to these initial samples of this one, I can say with a fair amount of confidence if you own that first Christmas album, I am here to tell you that you are likely to be disappointed with \"Christmas with An&uacute;na.\"\n\nThe only tracks on this disc that fully capture that haunting beauty that we have come to love in and expect from An&uacute;na are \"Nol Nouvelet\" and \"Sanctus,\" and this latter has already long been available on their first album.\n\nNot that all the others are bad.  \"Angelus ad Virginam\" is a little bit different from their original arrangement - a little bit more of a tribal Celtic folk beat to it, but still enjoyable and choral.  The child solist in \"Away in a Manger\" is sweet, but set against the old backing \"Oooo\"s of the piece it feels kind of like a cheap cop-out.  \"Ding Dong Merrily on High\" and \"Codail a Linbh\" seem promising, but the arrangements start to stray almost more into the nauseous nostalgia, rather than choral, category of Christmas music.\n\nThis perhaps wouldn't be so noticable except that the other tracks stray progressively further in that direction, and \"Christmas Memories,\" \"Christmas Kisses\" and \"Angels Are Singing\" are clearly vanity puff-pieces arranged in the manner of the dreaded Christmas nostalgia soloist album.  All of them are absolute disasters, and completely unexpected from An&uacute;na.\n\nHad they done away with these last three tracks and gotten rid of \"O Tannenbaum\" (an upbeat carol that does NOT work with choral arrangements no matter how much you wish it did), \"The First Nol\" (a sappy song that will ALWAYS sound like nostalgia music no matter how hard you try) and \"Away in a Manger\" (which, though not bad here, suffers terribly in comparison to the arrangement on the first album) and tried just a little bit harder to find good ecclesiastical motets or other traditional folk songs in other European languages (and there are plenty), that might have made up for the mediocrity of the other tracks.  Unfortunately, the few really good tracks make the rest of the album VERY pale by comparison.","483":"Really thought I was ordering an album of his older songs..  Sorry to find that it was only one song and not one of his best either.","484":"GREAT.","485":"Nobody but Elvis can sing this song!!! This is a perfect song.","486":"The above reviews have to be from relatives.  She is enthusiastic but the voice needs a LOT of training.  Amateur at best. I've heard better listening to karaoke (even at the end of the night when everyone is drunk).","487":"Love the mixes in the end and the creative rhythm in the tracks. nice piece if you like goth industrial.","488":"I love Christina Aguilera and O Holy Night is my Favorite Christmas song so what could be better than having my favorite song sung by such an awesome artist as her. She puts her own unique twist on it with her unique voice ..I love it and have it on repeat.","489":"I was appalled at hearing this recording on a local radio station--it is absolutely awful. The musicians are consistently out of tune! I just can't believe this passes for a professional recording--this ensemble is amateur at best.","490":"Another great album from America to get you into the Christmas spirit - with harmonies that have become a trademark of Dewey and Gerry. Thanks again.","491":"PEACE.","492":"Great songs!","493":"Paul may have the most original male voice to ever be heard on the Idol stage.  How the American Public could have voted this guy off before Jacob, Stefano, James, etc., is beyond me.\n\nThis album is fantastic - and is exactly what I expected from Paul McDonald: a solid rock album with hints of country and blues mixed in.  His voice is fantastic and I predict he will be one of the only people to do anything after this season (the other will be Pia).  Whoever wins 2011 Idol will fade away before the year ends, no doubt about it.\n\nI love this record.","494":"Listening to Paul and The Grand Magnolias is like hanging out with a group of people you really like and have fun with. I'm SO glad Paul was on American Idol, because if he hadn't been, this little gem might not have been noticed. Paul got my interest during the auditions when he sang Maggie Mae, and I don't even like that song. Besides being a great singer, Paul is a songwriter and every song on this CD is worth listening to again and again. I don't really know which song I like better. \"Whoa\" reminds me of something off the new Black Keys CD Brothers. I find myself humming the catchy tune of \"American Dreams.\" \"Sing Out\" has a positive and inspiring message that is very timely right now. \"Please Believe Me\" is an upbeat love song. There really isn't a weak song on the whole album. I just hope The Grand Magnolias put on a show in my area. I think they are a band that is even better live.","495":"This adulation of Horowitz has been making me nauseous all life.  He has never displayed any respect for composers intentions, plays everything the way he \"likes\" and always with a tight, hypernervous and unrelaxed approach to the keyboard that makes anything he does fatiguing to the ear and sometimes the eye.\n\nAs bad as his RCA recordings are, these DGG recordings makes them sound trancendantal.  I keep a few of them in my vast CD collection of mostly super quality recordings for comparison purposes only, to illustrate what a crappy pianist and musician he was.  By the time these DGG recordings were made, he was so past any considerations concerning correct style and composer's intentions that the interpretations, if you want to call them that, are completely haywire.  DGG must have recorded them only for the subsequent monetary rewards.  To \"musicians\" like Horowitz, the music they play is nothing more than the fancy clothes they put on to impress the intellectually vapid and ignorant.\n\nI hope all of you Horowitz fanatics are both shocked and perplexed to see their hero so trashed and ill-respected.  So sorry, but it's long overdue.  His performances are nothing more than case studies for musical archeologists and pathologists.","496":"Even as a ZO2 fan, when I first heard this song I had to look up who did it.  Talk about a powerful and moving testament to the depths of one band.  This opens a whole new dimension to their range and talent.  Very glad to hear drummer Joey Cassata's voice so crisp and clear on a powerful track like this.  I believe this will be a break-out song for them once it hits the mainstream.  The drummer singing a powerful break-out ballad?  Kind of reminds you of ZO2 idol KISS's \"Beth\", doesn't it?","497":"I'd only heard a few measures of this on the preview function and don't care for the arrangement now that I have heard it entirely through. Very schmaltzy.","498":"Hey check this out, the music on Victorious Rocks, this very fun and funky tune will keep you listening over and over again. The crew at Nicks Victorious are very talented and they have something different to offer that I have not seen since I saw it on Three's Company. This very show will continue to grow with this original bunch of kids who are tremendously refreshing to the eye. I am 45 years old and I got hook watching the show with my kids. (Nieces and Nephews) Do your self's a favor and support this original cast by watching the Show on Nick, you will soon fall in love with the cast  Victoria Justice ...  Tori Vega\n Leon Thomas III ...  Andre Harris\n Matt Bennett ...  Robbie Shapiro\n Elizabeth Gillies ...  Jade West\n Ariana Grande ...  Cat Valentine\n Avan Jogia ...  Beck Oliver\n Daniella Monet ...  Trina Vega\n Michael Eric Reid ...  Sinjin\n Eric Lange ...  Mr. Sikowitz","499":"Daughter likes - but awful music in my opinion.","500":"Wrong link: this is \"(I Want A) Big Butter And Egg Man\" - played by Satchmo -, NOT \"Fly Me To The Moon\".","501":"I've been a huge fan of Caedmon's Call for nearly a decade.  They're music was simply superior to any other Christian group out there.  In the Company of Angels remains one of my favorite all-time albums of any band.\n\nBut I agree with another reviewer that I don't know where this band is going, and it isn't good IMO.  The music and lyrics of this album are inferior to past albums.  Cliff Young is their best singer, and he's not heard much.  And worse, they're heart for worship just isn't there anymore.\nCaedmon's Call --- if you read this review --- I love you guys for the great music over the past decade and more.  But this albums stinks.  Return to whatever you were doing and whoever you were working with, because I'm going to have to listen to the next album closely before I buy it.","502":"I have always loved Caedmon's Call and I was extremely excited that they were finally releasing a new album. However, I was very disappointed with this new album Raising Up The Dead. I do not like the sound or direction of this album. I guess I will continue to listen to my older Caedmon's CDs and leave this one alone. I am a disappointed long time fan.","503":"Review - Tina D.\nTZVI EREZ, piano\n\nThis album is an absolute treat for Beethoven enthusiasts. Hard to believe that on one album or CD you find five (5)  Sonatas, namely the Moonlight Sonata as well as the Sonata Pathetique, consisting of three parts each, also Sonatas No. 13 and 17, plus the well known \"Fur Elise\" and the Spring Sonata - all compliment this outstanding musical treat. The last item on his program is the lovely Sonatina Anh. 5-Romanze- Andante, which no doubt, you will adore, as I do.  This program has been carefully chosen by Mr. Erez, who interprets Beethoven in an absolute realistic  exercise. This pianist`s touch is gentle where required and temperamental  where necessary, which creates an exiting interpretation of the music, yet at all times he strictly adheres to the composer's writings. These works are  performed on a 1912 Vintage Bosendorfer, which needs no introduction.  This certainly will be a nice addition to your Beethoven collection.","504":"John Lee Booker!","505":"great for my burlesque classes","506":"Always been a fan of Gloria's music. She sings like an angel and the Christmas song makes her even more special.","507":"I'm pretty sorry I made this purchase,because although it's hyped up enough to change it completely,it just doesn't standwith me. On a record it would have worked much better,because you have a warmer,softer tone.","508":"It wasn't what I thought it would be. If you want to hear a quality audiorecording of Anna Karnina, you can find them online for free.","509":"Liked!","510":"Get this record. It's has Oz Noy in top form. I have heard lots of hype around Seamus Blake and I can see why now.  His treatment of Thelonious Monk's tunes are stellar and a fresh take on his timeless music. Hearing Oz recreate those demented chords is really something. The song \"Minor Shuffle\" should be played at every funeral and wake as people file out of the place.","511":"A simple and beautiful song that was appropriate for the character of Lisbeth Salander. It's at the top of my favourite playlist.","512":"I LOVE THEM!","513":"I have enjoyed this song since I first heard the original version in 1989. This remake gives the song a little grit and is a good change of pace. I enjoy a different genre of music every now and then, so hearing how different the same song can be between 2 genres is entertaining.","514":"Only a few songs from the movie...a bit disappointing, okay, really disappointing...","515":"No matter what... etc. etc... if you're a child of the 70's... it's a great album.  Love it.","516":"typical of the recording in those days, the bass is in the back.  Used Audacity to tweak the EQ on it and it is fine now.....do not expect much under 100hz though","517":"Like many people, I bought several Badfinger numbers after viewing the finale of Breaking Bad.","518":"like everyone else posting here, I got my track from garageband loops. Don't claim it is your music, it's not. Unless you licensed it to apple, which in case you were paid I'm sure, which means you have no rights to it. Its distributed with their software, which makes it FREE to use as my own creation.","519":"I came to this piece of music because IODA--a group that supposedly protects independent music artists--claimed that the happy, peppy, electronic, free-to-use loop I got from GarageBand and used in iMovie to help create a YouTube video about my illustrations was this. Because of IODA's claim, YouTube slapped a link to this piece of music on my video. Basically, the link says that if you want to buy the music from my video, you could click and buy that piece of music from Amazon, GooglePlay or iTunes.\n\nI clicked on the link to Amazon to see if perhaps there might be some legitimate reason IODA thought the music in my video was this and not the actual GarageBand loop I used. It turns out there isn't.\n\nAs I said, I used a happy, peppy, electronic GarageBand loop, and this piece of music is depressing, slooooooowwww, and not electronic. I think it's all real instruments, including what sounds like several violins--when there are no violins in the GarageBand music I used--and what I think might be a didgeridoo and a jaw harp. I'm no music expert, but I can tell the difference between happy, peppy, electronic music and depressing, slow, real instruments. IODA's claim is like claiming Beethoven wrote the music for You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.\n\n\"The Dream That Dreams Us\" is, in my opinion, bad enough, but to claim that this is the same music as that on someone else's video--when it clearly isn't--is outrageous. IODA found a way to get YouTube to provide free advertising for their music at the expense of others, and YouTube doesn't provide video owners with any way to object. IODA gets to be plaintiff, judge and jury. Here, though, I can tell you the truth, so you don't have to fall for it.","520":"Have been looking for this song a long time. Most of our friends say they've never heard of it. My husband and I love it.","521":"Excellent song to run, ride, lift, even dance to.  Christopher Lawrence at his best.  This is the kind of trance music I look out for.  Hard to find this kind of energy filled music that sounds excellent.","522":"Great album.  Tash's voice sound similar to Bic Runga in the song Sway.  I look forward to more music from Tash and other Australian artists.","523":"Nice collection","524":"Love her voice!!!! Great tone. Would buy anything shes selling!","525":"Interesting piano (harpsichord?) and other instruments. Needs to played on system with good bass to appreciate and the song could be longer. Could be used as music to accompany appropriate video or in a movie.","526":"This is like the other albums: A great worship experience. The singer's beautiful voices blend into the lovely melodies, which are medleys of western and nigerian worship songs. If the artists read this, please make more albums.","527":"Love it!","528":"love this....the whole CD is amazing","529":"Awesome song!","530":"Ok song","531":"awesome!!!!!","532":"bought for mom","533":"FUN Dance muse!","534":"I work in retail so I hear different songs all day.  I heard this and the music itself drew me in and then the lyrics followed.  I think it is a great song.","535":"Love it as much now as I did 35 years ago.  Like fine wine, \"Breakfast in America\" just gets better with the years, from the haunting \"Take the Long Way Home\", to the emotional \"Child of Vision.\"  It is such a legendary album, and grows more-so each passing year.  One of the very best albums in the last 50 years.","536":"Nice Oldie!","537":"Such a huge huge disappointment.  A beautiful piece of music to meant to be played on ullean pipes, but this recording is NOT; it's a keyboard synth trying to sound like pipes; they don't..  The beauty of this Irish piece is the ethnic authenticity of the pipes and the building music with the strings.  Just no comparison when it's faked with a keyboard.  If you can, find a recording with Davey Spillane playing the pipes; it's magical. Tears will stream down your cheeks with the beauty of the melody and beautiful strings and pipe.","538":":)","539":"Don Omar is always good to listen to and good to move to.  Great way to zone out and forget the world.","540":"I LOVE IT","541":"I was looking for Video downloaded to my computer so I don't have to go on website.\nI can play anywhere without going to website.","542":"Incredibly musical and amazingly virtuosic. A real treat to hear these works on an instrument with such a special warm sound.","543":"This song is not a duet by Asha Bhosle and Shujaat Khan.  This one has only Asha Bhosle's voice.  It is nice, but Amazon does not have the duet.  Don't buy it thinking it is a duet.  Buy only when you can hear both the singers voices in the sample play.  It was very disappointing.","544":"Arrived ahead of schedule and all records play beautiful. Excellent purchase for sure.","545":"1 star because the purchased song is failing to play or download","546":"This is one of the most repetitive songs I have ever endured. It has a nice basic chill line, but who wants to hear it the whole song? Not me.","547":"This is the second album from the victorian gothic duo. The music is classic, beautiful and haunting--yet danceable!!! I would also highly recommend their first one as well...Five Nocturnes. Buy this..you won't be disappointed!!!","548":"My 6-month old grandson LOVES these videos - my wife said \"we should have bought this SOONER!\"  The bright colors hold his attention, the music is outstanding quality, the videos are incredibly professional - this product is AMAZING!  I can't write a review strong enough recommending this product - seriously - and I've written plenty of bad\/good reviews here.  This is a great value, great product, and great for kids. Purchase of the DVD entitles you to audio files you can download to play in the car - the kids (even the older 3-year old) sings them over and over again!  A wholesome, high-quality, great product for kids - at a great price, with plenty of extras!  Visit their website to check them out - [...] - you won't regret it!","549":"I paid and downloaded this song after listening to this on the you tube.\n\nUnfortunately, the Amazon format that end s with .amz is not recognized by the Windows Media Player that comes with Windows 8.\n\nBy the way Windows 8 is a piece of junk.","550":"This song was extremely big in the late 80s, early 90s. It's simple, but its synth beats and \"yodeling\" chorus is instantly recognizable to anyone who was mentally cognizant at the time (it was in a Listerine commercial and an ad for one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies, notably). The composition really feels fun and yet heroic at the same time, making you think that it's deeper than it is. It's a shame that Baltimora died before he ever topped it, and even more of a shame that there are no really good covers of this song to carry on the legacy, but that's neither here nor there: If you want something a little cheesy and a lot of fun to dance to, pick up Tarzan Boy!","551":"too much rap","552":"Love  it","553":"This album is all synthesizer and canned drums and loops. It does not sound very Celtic and is uninspired. The music doesn't ebb and flow at all and is stale. There's very little emotion to it and no heart behind it.  I would recommend you look elsewhere for a good Celtic Christmas album.","554":"I'm not a little wayne fan just some songs I like of his.","555":"One hit wonder, all  the other songs sound the same.  Why buy this entire album, by the single and be done with Baltimora.","556":"This release is quite similar to the \"beware\" album but this album \"the raj\" is like going straight to the top of all the other albums Panjabi Mc has made thus far. Some of the songs I downloaded are some catchy and for some strange reason makes me want to listen to it every once in a while. The tracks \"morni belle belle\", which is the very first song I listened to from the raj album on youtube and ultimately decided to downloaded it the next day and some of the others I liked, \"jodi big day party\", and \"akh de Eshara\" are my most favorites. The track \"freaky like dat\" is quite a treat as well. Overall this cd or some of the songs is something that can be enjoyed by anyone who will take good notice of the orthodox combination of traditional indian instrumentation and vocals along with mainstream hip-hop and R&B music all blended into a wild adventurous but great concoction.","557":"great music","558":"It's 1979 and the Disco trend is in full swing.  Every song on the radio features chants, funky basslines, percussive breakdowns and whistles.  Some performers of this genre of music could either make the transition to the Post-Disco format and some could not.  Thankfully, Payne DID with an underground hit in 1982 entitled, \"In Motion\" on Sutra Records.  Prior to that, her last outing was this, her Capitol swansong.\n\nOn \"Hot,\" Capitol seemed to have locked her into a chugging, Latin-flavored, Anita Ward-ish \"Ring My Bell\" sound with the first single, \"Red Hot,\" but there was only one problem- the only bell being rung was the gong.  This was NOT a reflection on Payne, but on Capitol, her label, with its typical lack of artist promotion.  If you're a fan of traditional Disco formats, this album may be for YOU.\n\nDespite sexy photography, festive uptempos and beautiful balladry, this album as well as its two predecessors (\"Supernatural High\" and \"Stares and Whispers\") didn't even touch the Disco\/Dance chart.  All three titles are worth exploring and are highly recommended.  Additionally, you won't need any Q-Tips for THIS kind of Payne in your ears!\n\nHere's a little trivia for ya TOO:  Prior to her signing with Capitol, who offered her a better financial option, she was offered a deal with Philadelphia International Records under Gamble & Huff.  Sadly, she didn't opt for the latter which just MIGHT HAVE proved the more beneficial choice for her career.  :-(","559":"I'm sure the cd is awesome but $70.00!!?? Wow.","560":"I accidentally downloaded this song, it's horrible.","561":"Good beat...One of my top Rap and Dance.","562":"Great track.  Nice groove.","563":"It's amazing that Fidel is still putting out such great music.  This guy has been around forever!  Rage Against the Machine and Sublime were heavily influenced by his Spanish punk crew Todos Tus Muertos.  He was in Mano Chao's band.  And now he's working with Puerto Rican reggaeton producers and cumbia\/raverton DJs like Toy Selectah.\n\nThe music is still more reggae than anything else, though.  Feel good, knee bouncing Jamaican music en espanol ... songs for spliffs and baby making.  \"Te Robaste Mi Corazon\" is dangerously catchy.  High recommended!","564":"This song was just so, so, not Mali's best. Funny, it didn't appear when I installed the Amazon Music player. I will have to look for it when I use the app.","565":"This is their only decent album for whatever reason.","566":"Beautifully performed song. She is awesome.","567":"I returned as it did not fit","568":"I like the show but not the album.","569":"Fun version","570":"This band is the brainchild of Byron Duff,  a little-known guitar genius from Seattle. The sound is heavy, punky,jazzy, metallic and noisy all at the same time. Fans of everything from Sonic Youth grunge to the prog-rock of Robert Fripp will enjoy this.  This is alot more than dirges and depressing metal-based drudge.  It's raw but hypnotic.  There's touches of well-placed frantic sounds, but also VERY precise playing.  Totally unlike almost anything out there right now.  Maybe a more garage-y sounding Them Crooked Vultures.  EXCELLENT!","571":"A great accompaniment track for a very beautiful and inspiring song.  I first heard it at a funeral of a very good friend.  The words kept going over in my mind and I couldn't get them out. It tells those who you sing it to of the marvelous unending love and grace that our Savior has for us and leaves the knowledge that the Lord will never, ever leave us and will carry us on into eternity.","572":"Sucked. Hated it.","573":"This CD is  great all around! I can just play the whole thing without having to skip any songs because they are all good to fantastic. Best of all, this truly glorifies God! A great combination for a great album","574":"This Country album by this very attractive newcomer has the flavor of an early Crystal Gayle album. Catchy tunes, and smart lyrics about everyday life. Simple, Beaver Creek Blvd and Band Aid really hit the mark... if you are looking for smooth country hits in that style then this is a CD for you.","575":"Truly beautiful song done by a very talented artist, a bit of change from her 'Awkward Annie'.  Kate Music is some of my favorites now!","576":"Good.","577":"Bands Under the Radar (BUTR) has been podcasting for 6+ years.

This is not the Bacon Brothers. These songs are actually from the classic rock group Dr. Feelgood. Once you download it, you bought it. I have notified Amazon and hopefully they will fix this soon.","597":"If yu like the Bacon Brothers, featuring Kevin Bacon; you don't want to buy this CD. It is NOT the Bacon Brothers with Kevin Vacon, it is someone else.","598":"This MP3 has an unexceptable amount of background static. This is the first Mp3 download that has had this problem of many I have purchases.","599":"We've been on a Celtic reel lately.  Motivated by some hits from the movie Brave (which my kids loved) we went in search of similarly sounding, upbeat instrumentals.  I use them to walk on the treadmill while my little ones dance around the room.  We find this one catchy and invigorating; it makes you want to dance. :)","600":"Great!","601":"I was just what I needed to add to a sound track of a documentary\nthat I was doing for our local video club with an Irish point of view.\nA hobby of mine is shooting video and showing our local group of\nfolks who also make short videos.","602":"This music is what I call \"Groovy\" especially when you are on a road trip.  My brother turned me onto it and just had to have my own.","603":"I just downloaded the 2010 \"remastered\" version of the song \"With A Spirit\" from the album \"The Hits\", and I was shocked by the over compression. The song was completely smothered by pumping and wheezing effects due to poor compression techniques. Very unprofessional approach. Whoever remastered the song had NO IDEA what they were doing. Mastering is as much art as science, and tracks can get totally messed up if you do it wrong. Mastering is much more than just compression. And trust me, I am no GOLDEN EARS audiophile. The effect is VERY pronounced, and very detrimental to the quality of the song.\n\nBecause of the poor quality of the remastered version, I chose to download the original 2009 version of \"With A Spirit\" from the album \"009 Sound System\" to see if it might be better, and the difference was like night and day. The original version sounds much, much better. No extreme compression. No pumping and wheezing effect. Very good dynamics, with crisp highs and rich lows. Plus I was surprised to see that the bitrate of the original version mp3 was higher than the remastered version... 292 kbps for the original 2009 version as opposed to only 280 kbps for the 2010 remastered version.\n\nListening to them side by side, you can definitely hear a big difference. The remastered version sounds muddy and squished. The original sounds clear and dynamic. So definitely get the original 2009 version. It is a higher bitrate file, and just plain sounds better. It is 39 seconds shorter than the remastered version, but you hardly miss 39 seconds in a 10 minute song. DO NOT get the \"remastered\" version if you care about audio quality!","604":"Wouldn't let me use the song on face book","605":"Nice song","606":"Good song worth buying","607":"this has skip in it.","608":"A great compilation album of the Rovers all time best.  Some old some new and great versions of all these songs make this a great buy.","609":"I am an old traveler, and found out about this band on my last run around out in Boise last year...This band is amazing!","610":"KT really nailed this one. If you are familiar with the Pretender's version, you will still enjoy how KT made it her own.","611":"It was an ok  song","612":"I bought this CD thinking the musician was the wonderful song writer\/singer, author of Blue River and many other fine albums and songs. This is some young probably talented Billy Joel wannabe from Reno with his first CD. Neither the ad or the packaging have anything on them that suggest who this person is, which makes me suspicious. Disappointing; I was looking forward to something new from the \"original\" Eric Andersen.\nJohn Henry","613":"This is an excellent dance and workout song! You have to move when you hear it if only in your mind! It always brightens my mood despite the subject. The musicians are genius!","614":"I love this show, more so than when it was originally on. The music intro is kind of a jazzy funk and I love it. ... it improves my mood certainly! :-)","615":"Love it!","616":"its ok,","617":"A memoral tune from the movie FX at the ending credits.","618":"I heard the song on a tv show and was very pleased to be able to find it on Amazon for purchase.","619":"it's an edition to my music library. this song will be good with the mix cd i'm going to burn","620":"What a voice! Beautiful version of this song.","621":"What can I say, I love these guys. These guys could sing the phone book and I'd buy it, lol. They are extremely talented and real. If you haven't saw their interviews, you need to, seriously. Just absolutely amazing guys.","622":"Love this! So relaxing and peaceful. I fall asleep before it's finished. So glad there is a Christian meditation option, I don't want to fill my mind with New Age.","623":"I put one of these meditation albums on at night and it helps on relaxing and getting to sleep. I went back and got the other sones in the series of albums.  I find them very soothing","624":"Hoyt Axton had a marvelous voice and did very well with this old blues song","625":"I just don't seem to get tired of how tight the vocals are in this group. Nothing really new, however, it's just that simple consistent message we need to hear in gospel music from time to time.","626":"Sandler & Young are a treat to listen to.\n\nIt's a shame that the last 5 songs on the CD are very distorted in sound.\nHow can these 5 songs be considered \"Digitally Remastered\" sounding so awful?\n\nThe first 8 songs are fine and have no obvious distortion.\n\nAlso, the CD has the songs in a different order from Amazon's song preview above.","627":"horrible!!!! This suppose to be remastered?  The sound quality sucks!  listen on youtube.","628":"Great encouraging fun music. We use it when doing street crusades and for bike & skateboard tournaments before we minister. GoHarvesting.com","629":"It gives the appearance of the song being edited but it is full of profanity! I was very very disappointed.","630":"Great old jazz instrumental.","631":"My fiance and I saw Ethan Tucker at a Slightly Stoopid concert recently and loved his music so we came home and bought this C.D. We are actually using one of his songs during our wedding reception.","632":"I bought the MP3 of this track as a pre-Christmas tongue-in-cheek gift for my wife, who thinks this may be the worst Christmas song in many years.  Alas, radio stations here in Iowa love to play it.  Oh well.  (I have nothing against Mulberry Lane, who appear to be lovely young women.  It's just a really awful song.)","633":"I first encountered Richard Campbell's work through the Rock Band video game, where his \"A Christmas Rock Medley\" was sold as an addon song for the game.  I loved the track and went looking for more.  I found Orpheus, listened to a few samples, and bought the album.\n\nThis has joined my list of favorite albums in just the few weeks I've had it.  It's a progressive rock concept album, like Rush's 2112 or Dream Theater's Metropolis Part 2.  It tells the story of Orpheus and Eurydice, a Greek myth about Orpheus, a legendary musician who marries a beautiful woman.  She is killed in an accident, and Orpheus goes to the underworld to beg the gods to return her to life.  Hades takes pity on him and agrees that he can have Eurydice back on the condition that he walk out of the underworld without looking behind him to see her face.  Orpheus leaves the underworld but looks back before Eurydice manages to join him, and she is condemned to the underworld.  A short snippet of another myth is brought in--Orpheus is killed by Thracians--and the chorus closes the tale.\n\nThe instrumentals are all performed by Campbell, who is veritable polymath of music: he plays drums, guitar, keyboard, and bass on this album.  He also wrote the arrangements, as well, and his enjoyment of Dream Theater shines through here; this album may not be as complicated as a typical DT track, but it could easily be mistaken for a side project from any of the members of DT.\n\nWatch the preview on YouTube at[...] and decide for yourself if this is what you want.","634":"Zhasmin CD Da!  First the tracks:\n\n1. Da!\n2. Most Beloved\n3. Guess the Love\n4. A Drop of Summer\n5. Three Words\n6. Time of Love (Non-Stop)\n7. As Always\n8. Sea-Sea\n9. Taste of Night\n10. Jerusalem\n11. You Loved Me\n12. Call\n13. It Should Not Be\n14. Morning Gymnastics\n15. Most Beloved (Remix)\n16. Cold (Remix)\n\nThere are also two videos: Most Beloved and Da!  Unfortunately I could not load the videos on a computer (W7 or XP).  My IT friend at word checked the disk and said the videos were saved in an older, not supported format.  Oh well.\n\nThis album has a lot of good tracks on it, my favorites are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 12.  I also liked 6 and 13.\n\nThe CD is packaged a little differently, kind of a booklet form with some nice pictures of Zhasmin and a lot of text, but you better know Cyrillic to read it.\n\nAll in all, if you're a Zhasmin fan, it's a good album.","635":"Dmitri Ratser is one of the best pianists in the today's world! The way he plays is absolutely the best of Russian piano school. I wish we could buy EVERYTHING he plaid in his lifetime. Unfortunately we could find this CD only. Long life and great health to this unique master! Thanks Dmitri!","636":"Wonderful rock song to sing along to in the car with the windows rolled down! Nothing much else to say.","637":"I wish I would have read the other people's reviews before purchasing it.  A bunch of karaoke caliber covers.  Terrible.  Absolutely terrible.","638":"The vast majority of these songs are cover bands. The rest are either a single member of the original band re-recording the song without the rest of the band, or they are poorly done recordings. Avoid this album, only about 6 or 7 of them are worth listening to.","639":"I was hoping that maybe, just maybe, I could get around 20 of the 100 songs to be to my liking.  Silly me.  There are only about 7 that are worth listening to for someone who has listened to the originals.  Waste of money unless you have never heard the original bands.","640":"Anytime i need motivation or self confidence i listen to kid rock! It gets you going with an unstopable frame of mind. My favorite - batawaawaba or stoned pimp.","641":"I don't think my version was by Club Nouveau...","642":"not exactly what i was looking for.","643":"Every crescendo and tempo change is jam packed with energy.  Awesome song to work out to or when you just want a boost.","644":"It's a cover. Make sure you read it and hear it before you buy.","645":"The music is excellent, , ,but what is advertised is NOT what is on the CD.  And I have all of the same songs on other CDs.  The cover art is not even the same.  Obviously one company made the CD, another did the art work and content brochure, neither talked to each other and the quality control department had the day off.  Then I paid Amazon charged $19.99 for something I already had.","646":"Anyone who is a fan of good Classic Christmas music would adore this album! Does not disappoint, stand outs are \"Mary Did You Know\" and \"Carol of the Bells\" for starters. Two bonus tracks are included \"Silent Night\" and \"Jingle Bell Rock\" and are defiantly worth a listen!","647":"Rocca really shines in this song, even PNO has some good verses (surprisingly). But Christian crisis, his verses are weak and boring, his flow is terrible and he shouldn't of even bothered to rap in it.","648":"Wonderful music .......  it is a blessing to listen and let God minister\nto my inner man.  David Ingles has certainly written anointed music\nwith a very unique style.","649":"A music box version of a song I was looking for is not bad, but I should have previewed the song before I bought it; this is not what I was looking for.","650":"It's fun music, that actually gets kids to think about what they're eating. It's like PBS for their mouths. And grown-ups can actually listen to it without wanting to plug their ears.\nA big plus when you're on a road trip with kids in the back seat!","651":"Avoid the Remus it us loud and weird","652":"Started listening to Kid Rock after he did \"Redneck Paradise\" with Hank W. Jr. ( which is also a five star or six ). If you like his earlier music ( read that as Rap ), you might not like this. Like his raspy voice and his love of America. Regardless, it's worth a listen as is \"Times Like These\". Makes you a bit misty eyed. Just give it a try if you like a mix of country and rock or just rock or country.","653":"it deserves 10 stars to me, a great song, a even greater singer. love you kid rock, have this downloaded on my kindle fire, listen to it all the time","654":"CAN NOT FIND THIS PRODUCT ANYWHERE CHEAPER. i TAKE THIS OVER THE COUNTER MEDICINE DAILY. I COULD GET A PRESCRIPTION FOR IT BUT WHY IT IS BETTER PRICED HERE","655":"Love, Love, Love Shinedown","656":"This is just a continuation of a great band's run of superior music, this is a great rocker to crank up in your car and hit about 90 MPH.  I saw them in Sept 2008 and they were great live.  Buy this you can't lose.","657":"Can't really writ a review because I accidentally erased it! Grrr","658":"I can not download this song into my library.","659":"Kid Rock needs to pull all of his music & have it destroyed. I was forced to purchase this & I hate myself for it.","660":"Let your memories grow stronger and stronger till they're before your eyes.  You'll come back when they call you. No need to say Goodby.","661":"I love the song the Call, have ever since I heard it in the Narnia movie. However, this version of it isn't worth the money I paid. I think I am going to have to give up and buy the entire soundtrack just to get the studio version of this song.","662":"Love, Love, Love Shinedown","663":"Kid Rock is the best entertainer...if you ever have the chance to go to his concerts, it is well worth it....","664":"I bought it for my Mom for a Christmas gift last year . This kids voice is terrible, kinda like fingernails on a chalkboard.","665":"The chick sings some pretty good songs. This is one of 'em.","666":"CANT PLAY IN MY CAR DUE TO YOUR IMPOSSIBLE APPLICATION.","667":"Another example of Jackie's amazing 10 year old vocals.  A beautiful, traditional rendition of this song.","668":"So delightful to have in our Christmas collection. Just a beautiful voice.","669":"This song is one of many that are my favorites by Kid Rock. Great voice and beautiful! I would recommend this song for anyone who loves rock.","670":"I cannot speak any Spanish, but love the sound and feel of this song.","671":"If you like French pop this cd is for you. Every tune is catchy and hummable.\n\nIt is a well crafted, layered offering that is a mix of dreamy, poppy, funny and heartfelt. Highly recommended.","672":"I'm not sure what others see in this persons' talent (or lack of).  From the start of the CD the vocals reminded me of two cats fighting.","673":"great song i used to listen to bryan adams back in my teen years.it is still good to listen to his music at the age of 43 great singer","674":"nice tunes","675":"Awesome song","676":"Downloads ask for last disk.  Unworkable.","677":"Best country album to own","678":"all the great alan jackson songs","679":"Yes indeed!","680":"great","681":"Taken it back to 1985, The 80's rock. Great song.","682":"One of my all time favorite power ballads. I remember jamming to this as a little kid. Great song.","683":"IT'S JUST A SIMPLE SONG D\/LOAD... OF A SONG THAT I REALLY LIKE... NOT MUCH TO SAY ABOUT IT...","684":"Best song ever.","685":"Great song! I enjoyed all the guest singers! Calle 13 does a great job again with this song (I'm not a follower of this music genre, but I do like several of his songs...).","686":"1 song","687":"These are not original recordings so the CD cover is misleading.  Go for \"The Singles\", \"Songbook\" and \"Flashback\" CDs to hear these songs - and more - as they are remembered.","688":"Considering that the New Seekers recording career spanned some twelve plus years its a pity that this new release is the same reissue under a new guise of last times greatest hits and the time before that.........\nThis is the pleasing mix of the New Seekers material that those who rememebr them will expect to find but it doesn't show the wider range of their music or vocal dexterity.  The recordings cover the prime 1970 to 1974 period and feature the Marty, Eve, Paul, Peter [Doyle]and Lyn line up. A few tracks recorded in 1973 and 1974 have Peter [Oliver] replacing his name sake who quit the band in 1973.\nThe mix of Circles is a horrible rehersal style mix where music and vocals simply don't blend and I can only think Polydor must have lost the excellent verson that was originally released.\nBeg, Steal or Borrow was hardly the New Seeker's greatest hit although it brought them internaational recognition as the UK 1972 Eurovision Song Contest entry.  The excellent B side to that original single One by One features on this CD as do a few lesser known album tracks Brother Loves Travelling Salvation Show with lead vocal by Peter Oliver and the enjoyable frothy Dance Dance Dance - the first NS album track I ever heard nearly thirty years ago.\nAll together a happy journey down memory lane but the New Seekers music deserves a more ambitious compilation next time.\nRT","689":"My daughter gave me this double CD for Christmas.  This is wonderful music to listen to, and La Maurache continues to be one of my favorite ensembles.  I only wish their albums were more readily available:  Their website lists two recordings that I do not even see on Amazon, one of which was recorded in 2005.","690":"Great music Mr. Jackson","691":"great cellist but not what I was looking for.","692":"Its an old fav from when my dad use to play it along with others, and its stuck with me since.  I love music, and especially music that brings back memories, this song carries those memories.  Great add.","693":"Say what you want about Southern Rock, redneck rock or whatever you want to call it. Molly Hatchet were one of the best overlooked bands from the late 70's and early 80's. This tune is an all time classic and one of the best songs ever written. The problem with this version is that it is not the original version. It is a re-recorded version that does not have Danny Joe Brown singing. Crappy re-mixing and I do NOT advise anyone to purchase this abomination. If you want to real song, you will have to find it somewhere else.","694":"great traveling music","695":"Awesome awesome awesome! !!!!!!!","696":"I'm not sure how the wording of the song was originally written but my church sings the part of the ocean meeting the sky like \"a beautiful kiss\" rather than this artist's version of \"a wet sloppy kiss.\" The word picture I get from that makes me think of a big St. Bernard not of our wonderful Holy God.","697":"There just aren't enough Xmas songs that have the word \"isthmus\" in them. Drew has delivered an (obviously) humorous take on the modern American Christmas spirit.","698":"Amazing!!! If you like this, you will LOVE the Under The Cherry Moon entire soundtrack! I listen to it everyday! Buy it now. Don't wait another minute!","699":"Pete Anders and Vinnie Poncia were prolific songwriters in the '60s and produced many of the Kama Sutra releases during that era which included their own performances under the names \"The Tradewinds\" and \"The Innocence.\"  They never toured or performed live as such, so these names were simply a foil to release their own material directly, rather than through other artists they were producing. Despite their generous output as writers, the biggest hit they had was \"New York is Lonely Town\" which only reached #33 on the Billboard charts. Kama Sutra records went bankrupt in the late '60s, the remnants of which morphed into Buddhah Records. The Tradewinds original vinyl LP, \"Excursions\" was very short in playing time, just over 12\" a side. In order to extend it to a more acceptable length for CD release, it now includes two tracks by The Good Times. Still, it only clocks in at just over 28\", which is very short for a CD.  Although produced by Anders and Poncia, The Good Times are a different group entirely from the Tradewinds.  (I should know, my brother, Tim, was the lead guitarist.) They had two singles on Kama Sutra and an unreleased album that was largely produced by the Anders-Poncia team.  On this Tradewinds CD, Pete and Vinnie wrote each track, including \"The Hard Life,\" but not \"That's When Your Heartaches Begin\", an old Elvis tune.  Although they produced this track, and Vinnie played piano on it, they neither wrote this song nor sang on it. These two tracks, along with \"New York's a Lonely Town\", are in mono, not stereo.  They may have been taken from the vinyl records, rather than the original masters. In my opinion, it would have been better to release the Tradewinds album and Innocence album together as a \"two for one\" combination for those interested in the Anders-Poncia writing team. That would have been a better value, and more honest.  In any case, The Good Times album, originally scheduled for release as KLPS 8052, remains in the vaults.","700":"Terrible quality. So disappointed in this download. I rarely purchase a single download but I didn't want to purchase the entire album just for this one song. Thankfully it only cost a dollar but even that was too much based on the quality of the recording.","701":"Loved this when I saw it performed on the show.  Now I can listen to this catchy up beat tune anytime.  Just love it.","702":"Horrible... I actually want my money back. Don't buy this... there's an annoying rapper speaking a different language other than English ","703":"Kenny Loggins is one of my all time favorite Recording Artist but Can compare to this version. They are the ORIGINAL ARTIST of this cut.  THIS IS an anomaly.  I worked A& R in the early 80's and Pages and this cut should have gotten way more mileage than they did. PROOF TALENT IS NOT THE ONLY KEY TO THE OLD WORLD MUSIC INDUSTRY.","704":"Gretchen Parlato has the perfect voice for this tune.  See her in concert if you can.  She's mesmerizing!  Never heard anything like it.","705":"This CD has only a few tracks that might give you that ethereal feeling, the rest is not what I was looking for. If I would have thought about it, I would probably have only purchased the two tracks.","706":"This is, for the most part, some of the best and most beautiful music by some of the best boy choirs in the world.  However, I was extremely disappointed by the turn which the Vienna Boys' Choir seems to have taken.  The last four tracks (Nothing Compares to You, Eternal Flame, Burning Down the House and Only Time) are not at all in keeping with the great tradition this choir is known for.  These tracks, especially the ones by Prince and Talking Heads, are, in my opinion, deplorable.  These tracks should not be on this album at all, I don't think.  Choirboys from Heaven???  Sounds like Hell!!","707":"I love it! remember seeing it as a kid and never forgot the lyrics!","708":"Too bad these are rip offs of other's hard work, this guy has been doing this a while trying to sell others work as his. PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT THIS PERSON who is nothing more then a liar and a thief!","709":"I believe that track #2 is a song originally titled \"Farmer John.\"\nAnd the arrangement sounds dead on from the Searchers LP I bought back in the 60s.\nThe Searchers version was a remake at that time.\nThe original is slower in tempo.\n\nTake a listen to the original first.","710":"There is no such thing as \"The Mormon Tabernacle Handbell Choir\" and this album is clearly a ripoff. Its sound is pretty mediocre.","711":"This albums does not contain any handbells and is in now way associated with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Don't be conned into buying this album.","712":"This is not what it claims to be. This recording has nothing to do with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, nor it's official handbell ensemble, the Bells On Temple Square. This is somebody stealing the good name of the LDS Church, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir Organization and it's trademarks and art, and using them for personal gain. Do not purchase this album. These aren't even real handbells on this recording, but obviously a cheap synthesizer. The Bells On Temple Square doesn't have any recordings yet. Whoever is behind this fake is trying to take advantage of this.","713":"female singing\nchant  Very nice","714":"Lovely soothing Holy Voices..Recommend this beautiful Music from the Sisters with Angel Voices.","715":"Sound quality very poor.  Sourced from mini lp, complete with scratched.  YouTube videos of same recording 100% better","716":"Love this","717":"watch the video, feel better =)","718":"Good voice, however with experience she flies!!  If you haven't listened to her lately, I would waste no time doing so!!","719":"This is a great song!  Learned a new easy Line Dance to it this past weekend.","720":"I can't listen to it because my browser is \"no longer supported.\"","721":"I love this song","722":"Came up with the Christmas albums so I went ahead and ordered it. Bad idea. Now stuck with something I didn't want.","723":"What a treasure","724":"Cheri's meditation CD helped me to achieve deep relaxation through guided imagery.  Using the CD helped to achieve improved physical and mental state of relaxation.  I would recommend it to others.","725":"This CD is an introductory CD to a whole series of some 25 produced by Michael Haas and recorded and released by Decca.  I think it's one of the most important things that's happened in classical music recording in the past 20 years.  That's because Haas is a real scholar, and he has gone to great lengths to make this series as thorough as his Decca budget would allow, and to record music by a wide variety of composers  -- some who made it and some who didn't.  In fact, if you become interested in this topic, as I did, Haas has recently released an excellent book on this topic, published by Yale, I think.\n\nThe performances are all strong. This CD gives you short cuts by lots of composers, not complete works.  But it gives you an idea of the incredible richness of the (mostly Jewish) musical scene in Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia in the 1920's and early 1930's.","726":"Castlevania never sounded so glorious.","727":"I was looking for the rock style version to this song. They don't let you listen to a preview long enough and I ended up buying a live version which sucks because the song is ruined by people screaming and cheering. I wanted the song, not people cheering along with it :(","728":"Hammock has been creating incredible songs for years now, and have never stopped evolving their sound.  This EP has already become one of my favorite records of the year with its delicate arrangements and moving tones.  You can hear the trademark Hammock guitar, as it fades in and out of the songs with an almost ethereal grace.","729":"ty","730":"Only 7 secs..not the whole song","731":"This is an hour-long story about an improbable partnership between General Motors and Toyota to jointly run an auto plant in Fremont, California. The JV was formed in 1984 and ran the plant until its closing in April 2010.  It was called New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., but everyone called it \"NUMMI.\" It's a fascinating narrative, with interviews of workers, labor leaders, management from the plant and business school faculty.  This is one of the best radio pieces you'll ever hear.  Although the two companies were fierce competitors, each needed the other at the time.  GM needed to learn how to build high-quality small cars efficiently.  Toyota had never made a car in America and wanted a local partner for its first plant here.  Toyota chose GM's Fremont assembly plant, which had been closed down as one of the worst-performing factories in the country.  Interviews with workers recounted incidents of drugs, sex, intentional sabotaging of cars, absenteeism so massive that managers would run down to the local bar to round up day workers, and constant labor-management fights.  Contrary to almost everyone's advice, Toyota re-hired the vast majority of what was reputed to be one of the worst work forces in the auto industry.  These blue-collar, hard-drinking American workers were sent to Japan to train alongside Japanese workers in Toyota City to learn the Toyota Way.  Tape from those trips revealed a remarkable transformation.  Almost from the day it opened, the NUMMI plant had the highest quality of any auto plant in the U.S.  Its operations were radically different from any auto plant in America.  During its lifetime, the plant produced 8 million high-quality cars, mostly Toyota Corollas.  This program tells how this transformation was accomplished, why GM failed to learn from it and why Toyota knew GM could not copy the Toyota Way (ultimately leading to GM's bankruptcy).  The story is told by Frank Langfit in a joint production by NPR and WBEZ\/This American Life.","732":"I loved this song when I heard it in the video game trailer on youtube and the version by Peter Hollins and Malukah but in this version the guys singing it were really flat throughout the song.","733":"This montage definitely is more for those people who didn't play Halo just for it's multiplayer aspect, but more for those people who enjoyed the story line.  If you're the type of person who enjoyed the story line of Halo, and the musical themes for each of the characters and scenarios, then this is for you.  If you just liked Halo to shoot others, then this probably isnt.  :-)","734":"I love this song. It reminds our young African American population that they are special no matte what is being said or portrayed out in the media","735":"This is a cheesy version which does not have the same music at all. Of course she's singing the same lyrics, but the clip on Amazon Music masks that it's not the old-school version. I hate it.","736":"Classic song that gets you wanting to knock on wood....","737":"I bought this because I am a fan of Sugarpill and Stephen Jacobs.  This is not my favorite, but is still a nice addition to my collection.  If you like Techno mixed with the emerging dub step styles, you will enjoy Level Attack.","738":"Others have said this is his best? I wholeheartedly DISAGREE. When I purchased this, it was because I already had two of his other CD's, and I loved both of them. (There was one song on each of those CD's that I didn't like, so I assumed I would like nearly all of these ones, too.) Wish I had bothered to listen to the tracks here on Amazon first. I would have saved myself the money. The only song on this whole CD that I liked was \"Hidden Away.\"  Everything else was Josh's gorgeous voice, singing craptacular lyrics. Oh, except for the first track... that doesn't even have Josh SINGING on it. (When I buy a CD by a renowned VOCALIST, I expect to get his voice in every single song. Unpleasant surprise here.)\n\nI used to think that Josh would sound good, even if he were singing in Pig Latin.  This CD proves me wrong. He still has a gorgeous voice, no matter what he sings, but I just could not get past the terrible lyrics or the odd-sounding arrangements.","739":"Amazing singer and artist","740":"I get hours upon hours of enjoying this wonderful music","741":"Wow. Christina's voice is mesmerizing.\nSuch a beautiful song.","742":"Perfect sound, excellent quality","743":"Josh Groban has such a smooth voice and I love this tribute to our servicemen. Very patriotic and with so much feeling.","744":"Watched the movie and loved all the music, but this one was the best.  Makes you want to get up and dance.","745":"Ghetto welfare music.  Didn't buy it for myself.","746":"As one of Michael W. Smith's biggest fans, and also a bluegrass affectionado, when I saw this in the store the other day I was genuinely excited.  However, I have been pretty disappointed in what I've heard. Overall, the album is lackluster and has an \"easy-listening\" feel to it.  Secondly, there are no vocals, and MWS' music really isn't his without them.  Thirdly, there are at least five tracks on the album that aren't even MWS songs.  Sure, MWS recorded \"Awesome God,\" but if I were Rich Mullins, I'd be offended that one of his most famous songs is on an MWS tribute album, since it was him that made it famous and not Smith.  The same goes for \"Breathe\" and \"Above All\", which MWS recorded, but are not necessarily \"associated\" with him.  All it would have taken was to poll some fans before hitting the studio and this would have been avoided.\n\nOn the plus side, the music is extremely meditative, as I alluded to with my \"easy listening\" comment.  Therefore, it makes for good calming ambiance music. If that's what you're looking for, you'll not be disappointed, but for authentic MWS and authentic bluegrass, look elsewhere.","747":"Most of this album from what he did in the last five years and that what they calling the greatest. Without \"No Reasonable Doubts\" tracks this collection will never complete. It's not that songs are bad I just feel they didn't put his best body of work together.","748":"I bought this album for one song and one song only. I did not like any other song on this album.","749":"Again if I knew where all this was I'd use it,  but idk","750":"This is one of those songs that has some lines that strike me as just a touch too...corny? But I'm giving it five stars because I can't seem to get enough of it. It's a beautiful song, with a chorus that makes my heart stop. I love it.","751":"Did not download the whole song so i bought the album and did the same thing twice","752":"It's missing Jay-Z's 4th verse","753":"HORRIBLE AUDIO QUALITY","754":"This is a live recording. The cheering at the end of the song really, really breaks from the tone of the rest of the song. I personally wish I'd realized this before my purchase.","755":"good quality mp3.","756":"I only ordered the MP3 of One In A Million, but I believe this song is on the same vibe as a, Michael Jackson R&B song. Every part of this song just flows. It's just so beautiful..it may be \"my\" wedding song, for whenever that may be.","757":"I've just always liked it had and lost it somehow. Don't know what happened\nO.well.","758":"mmm... Nicki! Awesome lyrics w\/ great beats!\nBesides being a gorgeous babe, Nicki sings awesome lyrics! :-D\nLove how she sings in two different voices, and the lyrics... the lyrics are just F'in mind blowing!","759":"Pure Fire! Amazing song. Eminem and Nicki kick ass. You guys are gonna love it. Buy it. You won't regret it.","760":"lil kim need to shut up her time was in the 90's so was foxy's. kim went to jail and hasdn't had a hiot in years she looks like michael jackson after a sex change and foxy's best album was ill na na she still has issues not a nicki fan but eminem makes this song tolerable.","761":"I can no longer access to this file . I have triesd several timesd to recover it I wa using a mac book which I no longer use and can not access the file from another device. I later purchased the album , love the song","762":"song is ok.","763":"HAPPY","764":"Enjoy the way some BEP songs are like two songs in one.  And if you are listening on something with good bass, this is a real fun time.  Love this song!  Maybe favorite song off the new album.  BEP 4ever!","765":"Go over to YouTube to hear the entire CD...","766":"The MP3s on this download do not play in Windows or import into iTunes.  I wasted my money.  If anyone knows of a legitimate version of this product, I would like to hear about it, thanks.","767":"I LOVE this song but I never knew there was an extended version. I'm glad that I do now; hands down my favorite Ne-Yo song.","768":"Great","769":"I think he says \"$H*T\" in the first verse right away. NOT COOL. Wasted money on clean edit purchase.","770":"Absolute perfection, I am very selective about my music and the artist, every track is featured on my playlist, that doesn't happen very often. Ne-Yo definitely knocked it out of the ball park with this album, generated some pretty slick music videos too.","771":"I expected so much better from Ne-Yo","772":"Worse Ne-yo album, still a fan - just not of this era of Ne-Yo","773":"I recommend this product.","774":"The song was over rated the sound quality was terrible the volume was set low on the album itself so even with a booster it was low I simply wasn't impressed","775":"There was a brief moment in time where I liked Kanye's music and bought this song. Then I realized he is a giant d-bag and represents everything that is wrong with modern hip-hop. Kanye is to music what Kim Kardashian is to television, utterly devoid of meaning or purpose. Steer clear of this garbage and go support some good music like Atmosphere, Grieves, Tupac, or Logic.","776":"i don't listen to music music is not appealing to me it just sucks real bad i hate music l","777":"Auld Lang Syne New Years Eve Song is a very nice rendition of a classic tune, especially for a romantic New Year's night.","778":"Great balance between vocals & Hendrix' brilliant instrumentation!!!","779":"I really like Feist but I do not like to buy a song I already have.  I guess I should know by now -- avoid Live and Best of if you want new music.","780":"She is a horrible artist and I am sorry a certain someone ever felt the need to put this garbage on phone.","781":"I cannot call myself a Nicki Minaj fan. More power to her for becoming so successful, but the tracks I`'ve heard just don't appeal to me. But I LUV this song. Great, thoughtful and honest lyrics. Love the hook. I can only listen to it when I'm alone in my car, but worth it.","782":"Love the song, cant find it on my phone, which sucks because I paid for it. It must be in the cloud somewhere","783":"This jig has a lot of character. Not just for the holiday but it has a certain history to it and I like instrumentals on my Christmas playlist, too.","784":"The best!","785":"Out of all of her songs, this is her best one, and that's not saying or making anything better.","786":"Lovely cd!","787":"sux ass sorry","788":"hated it after i bought it","789":"love it","790":"I wanted the song from the movie Kight and Day. This isn't the one. Disappointed.","791":"I have looked everywhere to find the song Someday from the movie Knight and Day, also by black eyed pea, they even have it on you tube with tom Cruise on the stage while they sang it. Not saying this is a bad song,its\n just not the same  and I can't find the one from the movie and that is disappointing.","792":"I bought the song because of the beat.  I had heard the song at the skate rink and I liked the groove.  The 30 second sample does not show the rap part of the song.  After  I bought it and really listened to it, I was disgusted by it.  Too bad because it is a great dance track.  He had to mess it up with vile rap lyrics.  Even though I paid for it I deleted them from my mp3 player, computer and my amazon cloud.  Next time I am going to use YouTube.com to listen to the full versions first before buying.","793":"Watch out everyone! The Black Eyed Peas have done it again!!\n\nIf you are like me and just love music with catchy beats that makes you want to just get up and move, either dance or jump or get moving, you are always looking for the dance hit that will make you jump of your chair and get you going.\n\nThis is one of those that no matter how old, it will ALWAYS make you move and put a smile on your face! But are we really surprised?? Heck no!\n\nFrom the very first time I heard this song I was hooked! Before I even knew who the artist was, and after finding it was the BEP, all I could think was: \"-But of course!-\"\n\nThe BEP have a way to make their music be liked by all ages! Just picture a car where there are 6 people, 41, 13, 8, 34, & 12 years old, and all of them singing at the top of their lungs! That's what pretty much happens every time the whole family is in the car and the song comes up! Boys, girls, men, women, everyone is just taken over by the beat!","794":"Man, this song is bad, and I like the singles from \"The E.N.D.\" Its like 2 totally separate songs that they just mashed together, with no thought invested in how to transition from one part to the other effectively.  Just lazy, and one of the biggest mainstream pop disappointments of the year IMO.","795":"This song is good.  Not a classic or the greatest of all time, but a very good tune that is easy to listen too.","796":"Dog S*** song. Absolutely terrible! I knew Kanye was worthless but this song is worse than anything I've ever purchased on Amazon","797":"5 Stars for great music - 2 Stars for bad word left in\n\nGreat energizing song that makes you just want to keep going.  However, even though it is edited and the nasty words are out you still can't play it in your car with the kids as the word A _ _ is left in.  Clean means \"Clean\" got it editors.  Now I got to go in and edit it myself.  Lose 3 stars for the inconvenience to still edit my own song.","798":"Worst album yet.","799":"Terrible excuse of a song","800":"Great addition to my music library.","801":"music sucks because there is no real value to music. only thing about music is people get brainwashed. no mi","802":"Makes you want to dance","803":"What's not to like? Great artists came together to create a great song that continues to be a favorite to this day.","804":"too bad the real songwriter:  donald Marshall isn't getting paid for writing Fefe Dobson's songs.....she's a poseur...see donald-marshall.com and you will know exactly what I am talking about","805":"Everything was perfect and the CD was here within 3 days!","806":"This song was quoted as the song from the movie Knight & Day. Its not the same song.\n\nVery disappointing.","807":"This is not the song I was expecting. I will read the reviews before I purchase next time. Not Amazon's fault but very disapointing. I wanted the song at the end of the Movie -\"Knight and Day\" and this is not it. The Black Eyed Peas or the movie producers are ripping people off. Live and learn.","808":"I downloaded this, after listening to the \"snippet\" sample\" online, only to find that this was NOT the same version that appears at the end of the movie, \"Knight & Day\", in fact....it's NOTHING like it!  I am not a big fan of this group, and basically I downloaded the MP3 d\/l because of the fantastic guitar work that appeared in the movie version....absent here, so don't waste you money d\/l this, thinking it's something which it clearly is not!  It appears that the \"full\" version of this song isn't availble on the BEP disc \"The Beginning\" OR on the OST recording?!?!? WHY NOT record label people?","809":"XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX X This is a a lousy music  track. Don't bother. It blows big!","810":"Great","811":"I have heard this song a lot lately, in various stores and pumping through the loudspeakers at the gym before I turn on my ipod.  It sounds like something that was designed by a committee to hit that perfect combination of catchy, trendy and completely inoffensive.  Somehow it's also gratingly annoying and sticks in your (your here being \"my\") head for days after it's been heard.  It's worse than \"It's A Small World After All.\"  Perhaps it's the familiarity of the \"Time Of My Life\" lyric that adds the hook, because the rest is comprised of a startlingly unoriginal dance track with generic lyrics about losing control on the dance floor and being freaky freaky, etc., which should, in theory, just blend in with the rest of the background noise.  I might just walk out of the next store where I hear this playing if I am near the exit and don't have a full cart of groceries which I will have to abandon. To the powers that be who decided to assault my ears with the repeated plays of this little gem, please, for the love of all that is good in the world, pick something else.","812":"Ronald Isley is wonderful","813":"His debut album is very good. His first single \"No More\" is the best one since he recorded back in fall of 2009 after completing his three year prison term in Terre Haute and two years living in a halfway house in St. Louis. His album gains a lot of popularity on his comeback for the first time since his three year absence from the music industry. After he did just one album with Geffen along with the collaboration with rapper Tip \"T.I.\" Harris and with \"The Legendary Queen of Soul\" Miss Aretha Franklin, He went on to sign with eOne Music and released \"This Song is for You\" in 2013 and released his two hit singles \"My Favorite Thing\" w\/Kem and \"Dinner and a Movie\".","814":"Kanye West claims to be suffering for his art. I assure you it's nothing compared to the pain of having to endure the noise he tries to pass off as music.","815":"Fefe Dobson is dynamic and far from any \"Ghost\" with this particular song! She delivers all her trademark fiery energy and appeal which is undeniably reminiscent of the early work of my other favorite singer and her contemporary Avril Lavigne. Dobson showcases her good vocals and alternative rock here quite well like she did with her self-titled debut album. If you never heard of this talented and fearless singer Fefe Dobson, I recommend getting a copy of her first album which is top-notch. Good job, Fefe Dobson!","816":"ok","817":"never purchased it....","818":"It was free and I'm glad I didn't pay for it.","819":"She has had better","820":"Chrisette Michele is a true Songstress!  She can do more than simply hit a tune she has a powerful, beautiful voice that she masters wonderfully based on possessing true talent.  Unfortunately, there are so many who think they can sing but can't - not so for the lovey and talented Chrisette Michele!!!  So Glad to have Chrisette in my music collection!!!","821":"song","822":"Upbeat tempo, nice remix on a very cool piece of music.","823":"GREAT CD","824":"This is a awesome cd. it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this cd are\n\nTracks\n\n1. on and on\n2. turn around(5,4,3,2,1)\n4. who dat girl\n6. respirator\n7. club can't handle me\n\nif you have not listened to this cd then I recommend you do","825":"fun song","826":"If you are lovers of the zither, then this Cd is for you.  You won't find the everyday Christmas songs, but a variety of lovely old Bavarian music. Every time I listen to this I am instantly transported to the Alps during the most marvelous time of the year.","827":"very good","828":"Soulful","829":"I would recommend this to anyone who has seen Narnia Prince Caspian and liked the song by Regina Spektor at the end of the movie.  This song sounds a lot like it.","830":"He Is We is Phenomenal!  If you have not heard this track or their album, I would HIGHLY recommend it!","831":"love it","832":"I love this song great old vibe. very laid back and fun song. I remember listening to this song on the radio.","833":"I don't know who this is, but this is NOT the Owl City version. I am very upset at the false advertising.","834":"for real.  the song is called F-ing perfect and you leave gaps in the song?  I downloaded it and discovered too late that it was a ripped up version.  My bad.","835":"Sadly, a disappointment.  This is a charming work by the late Enlightenment polymath Francois-Andre Danican Philidor (1726-1795). From a musical family, he started as a choir boy in the Chapelle Royale, and continued to rise in the King's musical service.  But while performing and composing, Philidor apparently learned the game of chess, and over a number of years, rose up to become Europe's greatest chess player.  And Philidor was no slouch at composing either (mostly opera-comique) during the era of Gluck, Monsigny, and Gretry in Paris. \"Le Sorcier\"is a two-act work, a kind of Singspiel in French (no recitative, just spoken dialogue) somewhat in the folk-opera style of Rousseau's \"La devin du village\" from a decade earlier. The premiere of \"Le Sorcier\" in Paris in 1764 was moderately successful, and the very young Mozart was in town at the time; it's possible that \"Le Sorcier\" could have influenced Mozart in his own young Singspiel composing.\n\nThe problem here is the performance.  It's.....awful. (It pains me to say that.)  The singing is the main culprit:  sopranos wobble all over the place, and tenors sometimes can't even reach up to hit the notes they're supposed to.  The orchestral work, while not as bad, is nothing memorable. The excuse that this is a provincial group (the Orchestre de Rennes) doesn't fly; in classical-performer-rich Europe, even local groups can often turn in excellent performances, and there might even be a few U.S. university groups that could do better than this.  The one minor positive here is that, since all the performers are French, pronunciation during the spoken dialogue is excellent.  Indeed, one occasionally gets the impression that the performers believed they were putting on a play with music segments.\n\nBut \"Le Sorcier\" is a fun, saucy work that is worthy of a better recording.  This is the ideal kind of work for Ryan Brown and his Opera Lafayette, who've turned in several excellent performances of works from this period.","836":"Great rendition of this song.","837":"Good","838":"This is not one of her better songs,","839":"Everything worked out smooth. arrive timely, great gift for me absolutely no complaints.\nI personally bought this for myself, play it all the time.","840":"I was really excited to hear Sam Beam's newest creation mostly after seeing him live this fall and getting a preview of the upcoming album.  I took note when he covered \"Such Great Hights\" and instantly fell in love with his voice.\n\nWalking Far from Home is a brilliant track that finally seems to give Sam a voice instead of the whisper we all know and love.  And what a voice!  Even though the song is amazing, this track seems to be a little over mastered.  And sadly that continues to the other two.\nSummer in Savannah when played live has such depth to its sound.  Over-mastered and flat sound on the recording.\nHearing Biting your Tail this way scares me.\n\nThere is something big that these recordings are missing. I really hope that Sam Beam comes out with a LIVE ALBUM soon to show the world these songs' true colors and sound.","841":"Useless! And I really wanted to like this recording. Lots of superlatives and prases for self, nothing useful.","842":"Disappointing, there were a number of really good tracks from the cartoon show they omitted from this soundtrack!","843":"very pleased","844":"We bought this to use for Dancing at our Wedding in September.  It's fantastic, lush it has all the sounds of the bands\/orchestras from the 1940's","845":"Very low volume for all songs in this albun. was impossible adjust with itunes application. Could you help me please?","846":"I didn't like this at all","847":"Empowering, uplifting lyrics to help one make it through the darkest hours! God-inspired... truly encouraging!","848":"WOW such a smoothe voice. Good clean romantic sound that would add an extra sparkle to a romantic evening. This could be the modern day Barry White or Teddy Pendergrass. You are sure to enjoy and share.","849":"The song was lovely and perfect exactly as it was.  I was so disappointed when I heard the download sample.  Tragic.","850":"this song appears to be a \"remix\" of a really good Sweet Talk Radio Song...redo is a strange term, listed to the sample, it just seems like someone added a cheesy drum track ruining the song","851":"My house is next to 4 lanes of major-street traffic, and to mask the sound at night, others have suggested I get a box fan.  For the volume of a box fan's noise that I'd need, I didn't want the air flow that came with it.  I've tried a stand-alone white noise machine, but that particular one wasn't loud enough to mask anything, even on its highest volume.  So I looked for a CD of white noise or box fan sound effect.  Until I started looking, I didn't realize there were other \"colors\" of noise.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  It has a deeper or lower tone than white noise, so it doesn't sound as harsh, IMO.  I just wish I'd've found this cheap solution before I bought a box fan and a white noise machine!  I can still use the box fan, but the white noise machine is history now that I have this.","852":"MY DAUGHTER WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR A SONG WITH HER NAME IN IT. I'M ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND THINGS WITH \"SELENA\" IN IT OR ON IT AND THIS WAS PERFECT.\nAWESOME IDEA GUYS, THANKS.","853":"This album is incredible.","854":"I miss the show.","855":"The best tribute to Serrat, beautiful voices!","856":"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT.  This is Shouting and Praising the LORD music. Old school gospel it makes you want a shout and forget about all your cares, when you enter into His presents.","857":"Talented - entertaining and heart-warming!!  A must for every playlist","858":"This song claims there is more than one savior and creed there is only one WAY to be saved and that is through faith in what Jesus accomplished on the cross when HE took the punisment for our sins .Amen","859":"Good sounds, well put together. He Did It ! draws me over and over again and again. you will like it.","860":"It was getting really bad . . . I had to hear Nicolette's version of \"Rio de Janeiro Blue\" again--it's just an incredible song in her hands . . . er, throat, that is!  This is a second copy for me as my first is in Virginia and I am in Alaska.  It was great to find it on vinyl again!  Lots of good music on the album--Lowell George's \"Trouble\" is also sweetly done!  God Bless Nicolette.","861":"I always try to keep an eye out for music that has feeling and is not traditionally stereotypical of the culture. This was a perfect blend of what I was looking for. His music is amazing and heartfelt.","862":"It was easy to aquire, didn't have have to wait for delivery and it was good music to listen to.","863":"This singer, song wrighter is excellant, he has several CD's out but are hard to find.  They are not avaiable through major outlet.","864":"Although this harp is entitled Veracruz y su Arpa Jarocha, there is no son jarocho music on here at all, and in fact the harp being played is a Paraguayan harp. This CD is therefore mistitled and falsely marketed. The songs are nice and the playing is ok, but if you want real son jarocho music from Veracruz, you won't find it here. Shame on you, Amazon!","865":"muy Buena musica","866":"The end of the track is cut off.","867":"This thing is as uplifting as they come!  I couldn't sit still, I had to dance the entire album through.\n\nMy favorite track is 'March of the Clowns', a touching story of the trials and tribulations of a boy named Josh discovering that he doesn't need to be intoxicated to be entertaining, no matter what his Godless friends say.\n\nAnother favorite is 'Panda's Need Love Too'.  A tale of a panda named Andy who is searching for his soul mate but can only manage to find heathenist prostitutes.\n\nI'd highly recommend this to anyone who needs to reaquaint their spirit with God's joy.","868":"This turned out to me a 45 record -- not the CD I had thought that I ordered ??  Hey???  No so good at all","869":"Very little here...if your a Buddy Holly collector who must have everything recorded in his 1 1\/2 years of fame...your really getting 3 songs here maybe 4 recorded in better than passable sound...the rest is fluff and not really essential or something you'd want to listen to in order to get pleasure but more of a scholary view...and i'm not condemning the CD by any means i encourage ALL Buddy Holly collectors to get this...i got it and will keep it but i can say there's not much here but i'll probably listen to it again and again...but the best tapes i ever heard were his apartment tapes.","870":"I thought it was the whole song, but its not. Its a 50 second snipet of this guys rap. Just kinda starts and end out of nowhere","871":"I live in Hong Kong and could not load this app into my BB10 or Android tablet.  Please help me.  jwferrigno@netvigator.com","872":"Love this song","873":"I tried to purchase this song on the Amazon App for BlackBerry but instead of getting this one song the app tried to get me to download the whole album. I had to repurchase this song and one of the other ones I was trying to download on my computer. Now I'm trying to figure out how to get a refund. Love the song but the technology could be better.","874":"I first heard this song in 2000 by the Dixies Melody Boys.  I love it because it tells the story of a man who wants to sing for the lord but people won't let him.  When he goes to heaven, God is not critical and lets him sing with the heavenly choir.","875":"Just figured out in the past week that I am a serious Jazmine STAN.  Like I have put away the Christmas music to play all of her albums.  I was nervous after her first album and only listened to a couple of the radio hits... but seriously, every project is consistently good.  I have been ASLEEP.  I'm awake now lol.  Whatever she releases and when she comes to town, I'm there!","876":"I did not purchased this cd","877":"Catchy song.","878":"This a very beautiful song.  I am glad that Amazon has it for download at a very nice price.  Thank you Amazon.","879":"it is just an audio file with no video.  they want you to mail them proof of purchase after you purchase it from amazon.  what a bunch of b.s.","880":"A Christian Music (Hymn) history lesson presented in a creative, fun and intelligent way.\nAnd fans of the Christian group Glad will enjoy their take on the subject and the song\n\"We Praise Thee O God\"","881":"Good music!","882":"It's not at all what I wanted.  This an extended disco version with the song sung in the middle of a long string of guitar and instrumentals and percussion.  Somewhere out there is a long version done by the Beach Boys themselves.  I heard on SiriusXM but can't even find it on you tube.","883":"I heard this song about 3 years ago and absolutely loved it.  Such as inspirational song, speaking of the GOD that we serve.  He's simply awesome and this songs proclaims that.!","884":"Very disappointed! This was labeled as clean and most definitely IS NOT CLEAN! Returning immediately!","885":"One of my favorite albums but the vinyls are all warped. My order was warped. They replaced it. The replacement was warped. Unless you wanna put in the work to unwarp it just buy a cd or download","886":"Audio levels are very low","887":"Excellent","888":"Would get 5 stars if not so auto tuned","889":"Awesome!","890":"I don't know how I missed it when it came out, but it's amazing. Try the sample, you'll love it!!","891":"Let My Heart Dance is very pretty! David and Nicole is just phenomenal! They really touch you with this song.","892":"Awesome! It ushers you right into the Presence of God!!!","893":"The music is excellent, uplifting,places your soul and spirt in a worshiping frame of mind. Would recommend to any one.","894":"For me it is ok. Just not what I expected. I guess it's a matter of personal appeal. However David Binion is an awesome artist","895":"Terrible sound quality.","896":"I have other old recordings that have been recovered and they are WAY better than whoever did these. I got these for my wife for the car, completely useless since the audio quality is SO BAD she can't follow along - myself too. Someone needs to grab the originals and do it properly. It's a shame.","897":"My grandmother used to turn this song on when I was little and we would dance around her kitchen to it. It is so beatiful and melancholy.","898":"This song gives an invite to everyone who wants The Lord more than anything else in your life; Not only do you want yourself to be in The  Holy Presence Of The Lord, but you want to get as many people as possible to also enter through that door!  You just want to get as many on board before it's too late!  God sees what's happening down here upon the earth, and The Lord is more active about it than we can ever imagine or understand!  This song gives you a strong desire to reach out in The Spirit Of The Lord to others throughout the 4 corners of the earth!  God Bless your Heart as you continue to worship in The Name Of The Lord!","899":"Good music from a good band of the past","900":"It is played by Jimmy Shand, so one can not say anything more.  There are a number of recordings of this dance, all in strict tempo, and some have better sound, but Shand is the standard.","901":"Nice","902":"My copy sounds distorted and as though it was recorded from an LP with clicks and pops.  Am going to complain","903":"This interpretation of Flamingo is simply the best! With the genius of Jimmy Smith on organ and the great Lee Morgan on trumpet, this classic is nothing short of amazing! The arangement simply sublime.","904":"A classic. Need i say more??","905":"Doris is one of my favorites!  Pity her choice of songs leave a lot to be desires.  I can now chose from this album.","906":"Love the show, and the broadcast is fascinating, but this version plays back at a speed that's slightly too fast, thus raising the voices, throwing off the pacing, and messing with the music.  Better off buying it on CD from OTRCAT where the quality is much better.","907":"I have never heard of this song, but I love it. Songs from the Big Band Era are fun to listen to. It's what makes that era alive.","908":"This is not the full version, beware.","909":"I don like the sound quality of the recording. It's noisy, like ef it was recorded from a used 33 RPM vynil record.","910":"I want my money back only 1 good song but only well.","911":"A great basic Cha Cha tune. A simple straight forward clearly defined beat which makes it ideal for those learning the basic steps of the dance.","912":"Beautiful music!","913":"Awesome song. Very uplifting and has a great message.","914":"Raquy is amazing. This song is so full of twists and turns and changes. It was challenging and fun to choreograph.","915":"this is a great CD for kids, tweens and kids church.  Yancy rocks! good mix of high energy and slow worshipful songs","916":"Very poor recording. Buzzing on all the high notes.","917":"There's something to be said for an artist that still knows how to create imagery and take us on a guided tour of their inner workings and while they're at it, our own. At the first listen I said to my wife, \"Hey it's a new Neil (Young) song!\". Honestly, Mr. Will Clay does sound so eerily like Neil Young you almost can't believe that it isn't Neil. But, with as little as i know about the artist, I realized that it was more like a progressive version of Ole' Coyote Eyes (Neil) rather than a 'cop' of Neil's deal. What I did find out, I learned through Jango.com where Will has more than 1 song listed, thankfully (check it out, and while you're at it, check out Will Clay's song called 'Little Horn'...it's so real and spookey that it spun me back around again to the premise of Neil Young's 'Tonight's the Night' when he sings about the roadie with the \"'shakey voice...that sent a chill up and down'\" Neil's spine. That's the same chill that I get when I listen to Will Clay. Whoever Mr. Clay really is, I can't help but regard him as a true 'unknown legend'. Let's hear more!!! Some one needs to lasso this guy and get him into a studio, PRONTO! Geez!!","918":"Low quality recordings.

This Song really takes me back to the good old days of church music and praise!!!","921":"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Love it. Just listen to sample for yourself.","922":"Rob Mehl's song \"Waiting for Jimmy\"  hits home for me.  I have been to Key West several times over the past years and have ALWAYS been a Buffett fan.

It's fantastic music to listen to to wind down to. The lyrics are sincere and real. The melodies are intoxicating. Totally recommend this album. I would pay good money to see them live but they'll never come to Texas.","925":"Good collection. I would not call it the best. Some of the songs are not truly Bhajans but are more classical.\nPros:\n1. Lots to listen to. A large collection. In fact, takes a while getting to know all the songs.\n2. Some of the songs are well done - in synch with the rest of the collection\nCons:\n1. Some of the bhajans have been picked from other collections and do not synch up with the rest of the songs.\nOverall a great collection, unlike the ones you get on CDs.","926":"The MP3 didn't work for me to relax. The voice was not hypnotic or relaxing at all. I wouldn't recommend it.","927":"Being the President of the Australian Knappertsbusch Association, sometimes I take a hit for the team. That's fine. Bring on Rene Jacobs and his Freiburg Barockorchestra! Man-Permer brood of conductors (Rattle, Dudamel and Ticciati) - do your worst! But beyond good and evil and whatever bell curves you care to nominate, there lies the domain of Maximiano Cobra, the Sauron of his profession and breaker of nations. Exposition and developmental repeats, invariably observed, are his Nazgl. Who has the wherewithal to withstand his onslaughts? There are reports that Saddam Hussein loaded up on his discography as WMDs - and indeed, the Scuds that were fired off at Israel in the First Gulf War had their warheads removed and replaced with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/J-S-Bach-Die-Kunst-Der-Fuge-The-Art-of-Fugue-Bwv\/dp\/B003O9I0YM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">J.S. Bach-Die Kunst Der Fuge-The Art of Fugue Bwv<\/a>. Should Cobra wear the blame for Operation Iraqi Freedom and the subsequent barbarism that ensued? Could be.\n\nHere, he annihilates K 550. Not one stone is left upon another. Brace yourself. As Selina says in The Dark Knight Rises, \"There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits, you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us.\"\n\nFirst movement - 13'56\"\nSecond Movement - 25'07\" (verily, this is ground zero).\nMinuet 9'38\"\nFinale - 19'46\"\n\nI think that Cobra is using the second version. With steam coming out of my ears, I cannot say for sure. The development in the finale of K 550 is reputed to represent someone going mad. Evidence is now at hand - just look in the mirror!\n\nI was once a member of the Old Firm. It's not about moral judgments or existential bets anymore. Jesus and the Blessed Virgin can only do so much. I'm beyond that. My old allegiances have been burnt away. Bear Grylls is now my god - praised be his holy name!\n\nInsofar as I'm still capable of thought, here's Uncle Karl B&ouml;hm at his funereal worst (Vienna Philharmonic):\n\nFirst Movement - 8'55\"\nSecond Movement - 8'07\"\nMinuet - 5'11\"\nFinale - 4'58\"\n\nMan, as Dean Moriarty would exclaim, that's Paradise at the end of the road!\n\nThere have been some suggestions that MC's orchestra is computer generated. I do not believe that for one second. An investigative journalist (Bob Woodward) once told me that its constituents spent time in the Soviet Gulag - indeed, most of them broke bread with Alexander Solzhenitsyn in the camps beyond the Arctic Circle. Trust me: they should have stayed there.\n\nTo add to the terror, one \"George Schatzkamer\" (remember his name when the wolves howl at night) routinely claims on Amazon that Cobra is the equal of \"Furtw&auml;ngler, Knappertsbusch, Klemperer, Mengelberg (and) Golovanov.\" Under normal circumstances, I'm not a conspiracy buff but I wonder whether this Seinfeld-inspired figure is hardwired to Cobra himself.\n\nIn the remains of the day, one contemplates the half-life of Plutonium-244, the Great Dying of the Permian extinction event and the loss of legions in the Teutoburg forest. I can do all these things - and more - if you stand by me.","928":"Was disappointed to find this was a later issue not on the original label. Also two of the cuts skipped.","929":"Got to be in the mood for old time rock-n-roll. Not good for quiet prayer time.","930":"For those of you old enough to remember the Rumiko Takahashi anime Maison Ikkoku, this song will sound spooky familiar. That's because this is a \"21st Century Version\" of the show's original opening title theme, titled \"Hello! Sadness\" in the United States. Both the original version and this new recording are performed by Saito Yuki.\n\nThe original song was released in 1986, with this version being released in 2007. That's a 21 year gap, guys and girls. Ignoring for a moment how old that makes me feel, I have to confess that I wasn't initially very keen on the new version. There's definitely a lot of nostalgia tied to the original recording, but that's not the only problem. 1980s J-pop has a very particular kind of sound, one that I grew fond of over my many viewings of Japanese anime from the era. There are some great synth elements to the original recording of \"Hello! Sadness\" that are simply missing from the new arrangement, with new elements being added in for flourish (such as the occasional touch of electric guitar). I suppose this was done to give it a more modern feeling.\n\nAfter getting over the initial nostalgia shock, I really grew to appreciate the new recording. Saito's performance is still relaxed and beautiful, and the new arrangement is  just as moving now as the original was then. I sort of wish the album would have included the original cut as well -- you can't currently find it for sale on Amazon -- but that aside, the song is well worth it if you like melodic J-pop or were a fan of Maison Ikkoku.","931":"This is a great song for ATS. It's a lot of fun to dance to and can really get an audience pumped up.","932":"Amazing long ambient work by Max Corbacho.","933":"Rick Cutler's latest collection of piano instrumentals is a moody and evocative affair worthy of the album's equally atmospheric title and cover.\n\nThe 18 tracks contained on the CD are very cinematic in feel, which should come as no surprise since Cutler writes and performs music for film and television. He also served as Gregory Hines's keyboardist and musical director for 18 years and currently tours as Liza Minnelli's drummer, and has also worked with scores of other notable artists in between, giving Cutler an edge as a brilliant composer and a seasoned musician.\n\nCutler is a crafty tunesmith, always drawing you in with captivating hooks, sometimes giving you what you anticipate, and other times taking you in unexpected directions, yet leaving you musically satisfied. The compositions, which include tips of the hat to such classical and jazz influences as Debussy and McCoy Tyner, are subtle and understated and function as a sort of tonic for the psyche.\n\nInterspersed throughout the album are three \"Alien Landscapes\" that exemplify Cutler's simultaneously adventurous and eerie sensibilities. With the CD as a whole, Cutler has definitely cultivated an artistically and intellectually stimulating sonic landscape for inner reflection and deep reverie.","934":"If the names Nujabes, Fat Jon, or Emancipator are familiar to you, then this is right up your alley. Very chill","935":"Some songs are so bad they're almost good. This isn't one of them. \"A Real Man\" is simply awful and Agnes-Nicole's voice is so annoying it pisses me off. I wish these so-called \"Hollywood wives\" would stay away from things they know nothing about and leave room for people with actual talent.","936":"Good song with a fine message.","937":"Cole Porter is one of the best American composers of all time, so when one of his best songs is coupled with a great orchestra how can you miss?","938":"I downloaded The Garden Of Eden by Joe Valino and Darling You Sent Me by Sam Cooke was downloaded instead.  At least one other song (one by the Ames Bros.) was also mixed up with a Sam Cooke number. Avoid this mp3 listing.","939":"I thought this would provide information I have not heard before, but I have read it before by searching the internet. This would be good for someone who prefers to learn through audio than reading, though.","940":"Great album by talented performers.

Why this album is frankly the best hip-hop Iv'e heard in yrs is: He speaks the truth of the streets, spits knowledge, of corrupt government and raps about the truth of slaves and the killing of the indians too his daughters. Nobody has copped this yet, really? Between each song there is a history lesson as well as paying tribute to MLK, Malcom X and Huey P, which rolls and blends amazingly into the next bombtrack. You WILL NOT THANK me enough if you get this.  It's been in my rotation for nearly a year. Hell Razah also guest stars along with Canadian producer DJ Extremediz.

I listened to the sample and fell in love with this song.. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to everyone... Great love song.. also, great wedding song..","955":"Great fusion album mixing hip hop and old Armenian tunes by a DJ from Little Armenia in L.A. A gem! I found out about Bei Ru in the soundtrack of \"A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night\".","956":"This whole Album is a winner.  Great old tunes, great instrumental soloists, nice arrangements (probably head arrangements).  Some nice Teagarden vocals and instrumentals.  Bobby Hackett, Billy Butterfield, Ralph Sutton - all the greats of the day.","957":"Ripoff! What a waste only putting 10 songs on a CD! There are more complete Fiedler Christmas CDs.

Her unique ability to capture in lyrics the highs and lows of life and love in a deeply spiritual way are proven true in her first CD, \"Prayers from the Heartland.\" Her lyrics are included in the CD, and are poetry to read. Her partner in singing, David Chaidez, blends in his rich tonal's with Gail's lilting, floating grace notes. Grace in the deeper sense of the word. The 8th track, \"One Woman's Song for Love\", is especially beautiful to me. Those seeking heartfelt wisdom and beauty in words and song cannot go wrong with this CD.","962":"The original from the movie was an orchestra version, not organ, and not in real stereo - just simulated.

I googled Bielefelder Kinder Chore and this is what I get? Not good! Please avoid.","970":"wtf","971":"The music in this song would come in really strong to where you couldn't hear the person speaking and then it would go really soft and be in the background. The music was very distracting from what the speaker was saying so you didn't really get anything out of the session. Very disappointing overall. I wish I would have known before I bought I wouldn't have wasted my time with this song.","972":"My record arrived broken.  I do not know if it broke during transportation, or before it was even sent. It was cheap however so I got over it in a couple of days.","973":"I had heard the opening fragment of the first track 'Red House' somewhere and thought this promises to be an interesting, modern, arrangement of an eighteenth-century country dance. Buying the CD proved to be a big disappointment.  It is as though they do not think the melodies are able to stand on their own; from the very start of each track the tunes are decorated in, to my mind, a rather sickly fashion, where all the musicians must play something, however fragmented, all the time.  The pianist comes in for most of the blame here, vigorously scaling, arpeggiating and trilling all over the place so that the humbler wind and string players are relegated to the background even if they have the principal theme : not that the principal theme stays constant for very long as previously mentioned.  There is an overall impression of improvisation which, praiseworthy when done well, often results here in strange harmonies and overlaps which undermine the shape and feeling of the piece so that major or minor tonality has barely any effect.  Incessant decorative twiddles and runs of the piano in a higher register than the main theme trivialise all the pieces and become very tiresome thoughout.  The pianist is obviously a dominant member of the group and quite skilled, but should have been toned down in the recording for overall balance.  String and wind players play tiny irrelevant fragments when the piano has what should be a solo.  It seems as though they reach a consensus about a chord and as long as each plays something vaguely belonging to that chord it will be OK.  Inevitably, the rhythms suffer, indeed, are sometimes lost in this jumble.  As a country dancer of nearly 40 years experience I have survived many dances where live music has failed to live up to its expectation: this is the first commercially produced CD of country dance music I have bought which leaves me with the same feelings.","974":"Michael Milton\nThrough the Open Door (Music For Missions)\nReleased January 2011\nRobert Ham\nStyle: Acoustic folk\/country; compare to Neil Young, Steven Curtis Chapman, Dan Fogelberg\n\nTop tracks: \"Eclogue for the Church Triumphant,\" \"Mississippi-Louisiana Line,\" \"The Gadarene\"\n\nIs there anything Michael Milton can't do? He's written numerous books, leads the Reformed Theological Seminary, and hosts a Bible study program on DIRECTV. And he has now released three CDs of plaintive spiritual folk that are musically opulent and emotionally stirring. Milton and his collaborators--including singer\/songwriter Michael Card--have crafted an uncommonly varied set of songs, ably tackling bluegrass, lite rock, and country. It skews too heavily on the side of mellow, leisurely paced material, but still pulls off some unexpected moments like the arresting strings and piano that mark the closing track, \"Eclogue for the Church Triumphant,\" which, heard free of Milton's reading from Revelations 21:5, reminded me of no less than the Lou Reed\/John Cale collaboration Songs for Drella.\n\nThis review is Copyright  2011 Christianity Today ([...])","975":"Marillion rules. Best album ever. Great music. Great memories. Great times.","976":"Absolutely the best recorded performance of \"Gaite Parisienne\".  It bubble and sparkles like no other recorded performance.  Quality of the recording might be considered audiophile by some listeners.","977":"I played my way through 2 LPs of this concert and loved every minute of it. When the technology became available, I transferred one of the LPs to a CD. Since this set never came out in any other format, I strongly urge lovers of French-Canadian ballads and of chorale music to purchase a vinyl disc and do the transferring themselves.\n\nOne side is devoted to Christmas music, the other to love ballads. If the Chorale Bach de Montreal is perhaps a bit starchy for a few of these selections, this does not detract from the beauty of the overall product. Tres bien all the way.","978":"The CD sound is good, an improvement over the lp, but not as good as some competitive interpretations (Tate, Klemperer, Davis,Jochum). Virtues are characteristic of Leitner: good tempi and orchestral balance, forward winds,, good brass and tympani. #102\/4 is played with elan. The military music in 100\/2\nis moderate where excess sometimes works.  Leitner's more recent Haydn was more successful (#6-8, 5,54, 92,98). But so too were his priceless Mozart performances\nwith the Bavarian RS0: the Posthorn Serenade and the Linz and Paris Symphonies. I find this coupling worthwhile but not imperative. Leitner remains undervalued by many critics.  He was anything but a Kapellmeister.\n\nPeers: Tate, Klemperer, Jochum, Davis  in both; Sawallisch\/VSO in 100","979":"Love this album when it came out years ago, unfortunately what I received was a major disappointment.  First the album covered was in very poor condition which I can live with given I bought this used.  The real bummer came when I pulled the album out and noticed that it was not Tom Jones Live in Las Vegas, but some other album!

However, the reason for my low rating has to do with the audio quality of the MP3 version. It's basically ripped from a scratchy vinyl version! Seriously, if they really needed to make an MP3 version from a vinyl copy, they couldn't find one to use that was in better condition?? The vinyl copy I have sounds superior.\nIf you are a fan of these musicians and have a turntable, try to get a vinyl copy instead. Otherwise, the MP3 version is better than nothing, but definitely not as good.","988":"It is good steady Blue Grass music.

I have a fear of fire, especially of the house burning down in the middle of the night and this disturbed me so much I couldn't go back to sleep.\n\nI tried to listen to it during the daylight, but I just cannot find anything relaxing about it.

Not even Metropolis Records, the label, could help me. (Curious.) Of course I bought it about 45 seconds after I read my email. It arrived in a timely fashion and I have felt complete ever since. The only problem is that, for whatever reason. when I get to Track 3 (Project Pitchfork) the CD catches about halfway through the song (a real travesty) and I am unable to listen to the rest of it. It is strange because #1 the CD was still in the plastic when it arrived, #2 I have a boss CD player in my car, and #3 it is only at that certain part on this one CD.

Somehow it just evoked a cold, blustery day and since I've never enjoyed cold, blustery days, I found it nerve-wracking, not nerve soothing.  All I could think about was how this was what the sound track from 'Into the Wild' sounded like when they found the kid dead from exposure in Alaska. Gross!","1026":"Having a party going a little too wild? Need everyone to get out? Never Fear! Just put this little gem on and people will start trampling over each other to get out. Want to break up with someone and don't know how? Just play this song in the car and Warning Signs will be blaring in your significant ex's head. Need to torture those pesky Taliban's for information? Just put this song on repeat and come back after a few hours and they'll tell you what kind of underwear their mother's wear!\n\nSpecial thanks to Angela Pivarnick's parents for raising a spoiled delusional bitch, because only someone like that is capable of pinching out a song that can only be described as the Zen of s***.","1027":"I loved this group in College.  My favorite show was Howard's Club H in Bowling Green, Ohio.  When's the reunion tour?","1028":"Due to microphone placement this recording brings out different orchestral voices that you usually do not hear. Makes listening (particularly with an orchestral score continually interesting. Varried tempi with wonderful soloists. Not the usual PERIOD piece recording but more a survey of a different time & style.","1029":"One of the better songs on this, a very good album.","1030":"Quality of the recordings is very poor.","1031":"Lo Machin Del Rock Vol 2. se ve interesante,pero definitivamente pierdo el interes en comprarlo,no muestra el titulo de las canciones,ni quien las toca,muy mal,verdad?","1032":"Please be specific on this album... If you want to sell something, please show the songs that this album contains or maybe it's a secret!,thanks","1033":"Poor quality of performances.  My fault - did not have time to preview, needed some Christmas music in a hurry.  I suggest checking closely before buying.","1034":"Has really great sound and it's something I want to listen to again and again. Video game soundtracks have always been some of my favorite music, and this is one of the best mixes that I've ever heard. I wish the author would add a few more bonus tracks like snake man from MM3. This cd is usually my goto at work. I never get tired of it.","1035":"I love Mega Man and seeing as this is by far one of the best game soundtracks (to me anyhow) thats why I rated it a five. Brings back my fond memories and just a fun theme to listen to.","1036":"This is an awesome collection for anyone going through loss of any kind.  Thanks Amazon for processing my multiple orders for this CD","1037":"The CD was blank.  Very disappointed!","1038":"it's not the original from the album. when they remaster the song they cut short the begging and added something stupid to the end","1039":"Go Dre","1040":"Awesome","1041":"great song","1042":"Dre could have kept this on the shelf. Straight garbage,weak beats tired ryhmes what else can I say. Snoop needs a new gimmick I guess they needed akon to sell this.","1043":"No, don't run away.  There's no fire in your Mom's basement--this Track is fire.  The music video has over 7.5 million views in a little over two weeks.  And the more I listen to it, the more I like it.  And since a new Dr. Dre-brand-album always precipitates a lot of other great talent (and usually some well-prepared responses from the competition) it should be a fun year in the clubs. Maybe Detox really will be the SACD 5.1-mastered Double Concept Rap Opera Album it deserves to be.  Perfectly mixed and deeply complex, Dr. Dre tracks are the hip hop gold standard.","1044":"I was very disappointed with this CD set.  It sounded amateurish.  Having spent many years at Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa I've heard much better from Maranatha  Music.","1045":"cute song","1046":"I'm very annoyed, I ordered and I got a CD instead of a vinyl album!","1047":"I love the way Sinatra does this song.  However, I was hoping it would make a good song for a dance, but there is quite a bit of static and it's a short song.","1048":"This cd was very disappointing for us.  My children couldn't even understand this British mans mumbling voice.  Not soothing, and totally incomprehensible..","1049":"100% pure dubstep - every track is different, but every one is good and the entire cd has a great flow to it from track to track - 5 stars! If you like people like MiMOSA, Antiserum, Roommate, Babylon System, Djunya and all them - you'll love this.","1050":"Excellent disco funk deliciousness","1051":"I love Hal Roach -- have bought a lot of his stories.  Great comedian.","1052":"I can't believe how wonderful this CD is. It has the perfect Irish feel to the music and each song is fun and unique. It's a great CD and I certainly recommend it.","1053":"Don't really like this remix.  Too discoey.","1054":"I purchased this because my daughter's love the song from Pirate Fairy.  Well, twice in this version (and the other available version on amazon) she says something about being a b*tch.  Not exactly appropriate for a sing a long.  Is there a version without this?","1055":"Product as advertised.","1056":"Almost since the first performance of the bad created by Scotty Morris in 1989, Big Bad Voodo Daddy has been wooing aficionados of almost every music genre to modern day swing.  I would challenge almost anyone who has even the slightest appreciation of music to listen to this [what I consider their best recorded work] collection by BBVD and not become almost instantly transfixed by the tight l performances of the group; within seconds of starting any selection on this album [there isn't a 'clunker' in the bunch] you will find yourself moving to the addictive rhythms and beats delivered with a powerful professionalism not captured or repeated to such perfection since the original era of swing in the 1940's.  If you are tired of trying to find something 'new' to refresh your appreciation of today's music scene, do yourself a favor...get this album!  Load it up, turn it up and Swing On!  You'll thank yourself.","1057":"Bought the cd, but it is blank, containing no music on the cd.  Haven't the time to figure out how to return it yet-a hassle.","1058":"I play it for background soothingness....my guy friend who plays the piano also, loves it and this copy is for him. Can't wait to surprise him with it. My copy I bought several years ago for just $1 at the Dollar Tree!","1059":"I don't hate it,I was very dissapointed, I thought it was her 2nd CD,I bought it as a Christmas gift to myself so I could have something to open from santa in front of my daughter. When I unwraped the present and looked on the back,that's when I noticed there is only one song on the entire CD. I paid $13.62 for it. I was so mad that I didn't even open it up to listen to it(still factory sealed).I just put it off to the side and now it's probably to late to return it for something else.","1060":"I had no idea that I was paying $ 12.96 (includes shipping) for one (1) yes I said \"one (1)\" song!!! There is only one song on this CD. Although it is an excellent song and I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that she utilized the flute in the background music lending credibility to her \"roots,\" I cannot believe the charge for one song was over $10.00!","1061":"I was so happy to get this at first. I thought it was the cd for the show Bamboo Blade. I don't know Japenese and this was only the drama cd. which means it has all the voice actors over seas talking. which would be cool but its not in English.\nThis series is great though. so everyone should watch the show.","1062":"A pesar de que el concierto no fue malo, me di cuenta que no hay metales en las canciones (trombones y trompetas).  Esto es inconcebible para mi, los metales eran imitados por el tecladista, lo cual suena horrible.  Si Ruben hubiese incluido una seccion de metales en este concierto no hay duda de que hubiese sido un excelente CD.","1063":"Great tune  on a very good cd","1064":"I don't even know if this is an official release or not but something is sure, I paid 59.50$ for a single disc OST that does not even contain all the songs.\nThe REAL OST contains two discs and cost no more than 25$.\nNow you know...\nThis is an ost that is starting to cost me a lot...","1065":"Well, this was a huge disappointment. I was expecting other songs in the game to be featured. Instead, I spent over 40 bucks for a two tracked disc..","1066":"Wonderful quality and great playing!! I really,really love this cd of Yoon Sang Hyun singing. Thanks so very,very much for sending it to me in a timely manner!!!","1067":"This entire soundtrack is worthy of purchase David's songs sneak up on you and capture you with their haunting and gorgeous sound. Even a song at simple as The Things I Lost is on repeat for me right now.","1068":"The file is garbage. It's missing a ton of the song in the middle and I just ended up deleting it from my files.","1069":"Not the MOZ I was looking for. Sounds alot like Rufus W. Good music but not a big Rufus fan. Now I'm out 8 bucks.","1070":"Love his music.","1071":"This cd is not by the band Vicious Rumors that released the classic \"Welcome To The Ball\", \"Digital Dictator\" etc.....this is an English band from the eighties with the same name!!\n\nDon`t make the mistake I did!!","1072":"The shoes are comfortable to wear. I like the style of he boots. For the price can't go wrong. Delivery was earlier then expected also.  Thank you.","1073":"Buyer beware. This is a bootleg. This is not an official Apple or Beatles release. Proceed with caution & be sure to research before you purchase.","1074":"First of all, this is ONE CD, not 3 as mentioned in the other review. Second, it is not very good at all. The raw soundboard recording sounds weak, flat, uninspired. The final recording, as documented in Let It Be, must have been heavily 'doctored' to sound so good. Don't waste your money on this. It adds nothing to Let It Be.","1075":"I HAVE SEEN THE MUSIC VIDEO AND NOW I HAVE THE RECORD TO PUT IN THE JUKEBOX","1076":"if you are a madlib fan then you probably know about kankick also.  teamed up with madlib on production with Oh No, and also Wildchild's album.  the production was pretty solid then and had some good beats, however this album unfortunately was really lackluster.  there is no scratching going on, the whole time during the album i was waiting for a tempo change, but it stayed pretty lackluster like it was missing something for most of the album.  sorry kankick fans, this album was a thumbs down.","1077":"I REMEMBER BUYING THE ALBUM WIGGY BITS,I WAS BLOWN AWAY BUY THIS BAND,PEPPY CASTRO WAS ALWAYS A TOP SINGER IN THIS BAND AS HE WAS IN OTHER BANDS HE FRONTED,I BELIEVE ITS COMING OUT ON CD IN MARCH,CANT WAIT,OTHER BANDS THAT WOULD BE GOOD 4 REISSUE ARE,BELFEGORE,A DROP IN THE GRAY,AND THE POP....","1078":"Love ABBA!","1079":"Ok, I've bought this song 2 times and the album 1. Amazon keeps deleting it. So 1 more try. I'm a Prime member so they are trying to bully me in to buying in to there radio scream for $6 a mouth. It isn't happening!!","1080":"everything was as stated, very good, will buy from this seller again. Recommend to anyone wanting quality items. Good job.","1081":"I did not find it helpful doesn't mean it wouldn't work for someone else some times what I like someone else doesnt","1082":"I am a big fan of Sleep Solutions-- which helps guide me into blissful sleep many a nights. Goodbye worry is a wonderful addition to this collection of meditation cds. I am able to use Ms. Shapiro's soothing voice to help me put away worrisome thoughts, and replace those with more positive visions, thereby helping me to envision more positive outcomes. I am grateful to have found this cd collection.","1083":"Ordered to add to my collection.  Love the Bellamy Brothers and this is one song I didn't have in my collection.","1084":"I love this song any way it is done.  This is about the only song Timmy Thomas had done that I really like.  Would highly recommend it to anyone.","1085":"Great song.  Brings me back to when I was only... well, never mind how old I was then.  Fantastic music!","1086":"BOSTON set a new standard in the Rock & Roll industry but this song, Higher Power, was a total surprise in my expectation of the bands unique Gibson guitar sound and vocals. This song, with its stepped up rhythm and bass, instantly compels the listener to thrust the volume knob to maximum intensity to enjoy its full effect. Sensualistic beauty combined with thunderous cascading bass, vocals, guitar solos,harmonicas, (YES! a harmonica in a Boston song? and it captivates!) keeps you always at the edge of expectation which this song DEFINEATELY delivers ! Like a well tuned sports car, the exhaust note wants to make you accelerate past all limits with the comfort of knowing the ride is better and better the faster you go. Sophisticated enhancements with RAW wild power... \"Higher Power\"  DELIVERS! The small sound\/ vocal sample provided here is NOTHING compared to the songs complete ability to please its listener. Quite simply, \"Higher Power\" has become one of my most favorite \"go-to\" songs in my vast music library. Working in the Rock & Roll music industry for over a decade... this song has to be THAT good for such distinction for my taste and expectations.","1087":"I just love the rock that came out in the 80s. This song is classic. Take me back to a time of great music and no color lines. This kind of music is More Than A Feeling, it's eternal.","1088":"The SuperSonic Guitar Work & High pitched Vocals. A Great song for an Action Movie.","1089":"This is one intense song to play on guitar, but nevertheless, it's only instrumental without lyrics, so it's always family and party friendly. Even a 1987 oldie like this can be great for events, such as dances, etc.","1090":"Always rocks","1091":"Light song that seems to go well with the theme of the movie.  Its simple and complex at the same time.  Piano (Fender Rhodes sound alike I think) is awesome.","1092":"Long time Boston fan, Prefer Longtime only but not the way it works.","1093":"Amazing song. Adam Lambert sings his heart out. I listen to this over and over. Love it....","1094":"I grew up listening to Ray Price, been to many of his live concerts, even to his singing at one of the Texas Gov. balls held at the Driskill Hotel in Austin Texas back in the 1960's. WE just lost Mr. Price this last December at 87. His voice is so pure and clear. Yes I will gladly give Ray Price 5 Stars.","1095":"Great old music!","1096":"Old Rock never dies, just fades away if no one listens to it.","1097":"Rocks mighty!","1098":"Remembering this song, and the fact I had a free Amazon credit, I just had to add it to my collection, musicians become one with the instrument as time and playing progresses and I have always liked this song, recommended.","1099":"Charlie Wilson at his best, nice roadtrip song.","1100":"Greay","1101":"When Charice opts for ballad-type songs, she can never go wrong!  Her strong vocals are akin to other greats such as Whitney (in her prime), Jennifer Hudson, etc.  Am hoping Charice's producers - and Charice - opt for more songs that showcase her immense talent, and to stay away from the 'cookie-cutter' sound that is so prevalent in today's young artists.","1102":"I heard this song on XM radio... a great song.","1103":"Good song","1104":"excellent","1105":"This makes me feel happy like dancing in the streets which I do with my ipod.you should try it too","1106":"Stay out of Harms way.","1107":"DO NOT BUY THIS MP3 !!!\n\nAlthough I like the song, the quality of the recording is terrible (in spots).  Portions sound like it was recorded off on old LP that had skips and jumps.  I know there is a \"good version\" of the song out there somewhere because I've heard it on the radio several times.\n\nWhoever Amazon bought this MP3 from either did not listen to the song after it was created in the MP3 format or they did listen and just didn't care that it was defective.\n\nAmazon states in their MP3 Music Downloads Terms of Use that music downloads are not returnable once they have been purchased.  Well, here are my terms - I have an expectation that the quality of the downloaded music will be good according to most people's standard of digital music.  This song did not meet those standards.\n\nThis was my first and last purchase of an MP3 from Amazon.  I hope you enjoy the 99 cents.","1108":"Love the song don't love this arrangement.  I'll be looking for another version soon.  Thumbs down.","1109":"I found this album among my parents' albums when I was a young child and listened to it over and over and over. I can't believe it's now available as an MP3 download. The quality of the music is spectacular, much better than the scratchy LP I wore down from repeated playing. Thank you for making this available!","1110":"I was disappointed because I just wanted the radio version.","1111":"If this is the best song in the 2000's you are sadly mistaken. Anything from this \"artist\" should not be bought.\nAvoid beyonce at all cost. Instead buy my albums on itunes you'll thank me later.","1112":"This was an unintentional purchase on my part. I don't like Beyonc's music. Now I know the Beygency might come for me, but I'm going to say it.  Her earlier music was mediocre at best, but her newer stuff is ghetto and downright trashy. I don't like our younger kids being exposed to such garbage. Shame on you Beyonc, you're old now, your music needs to mature accordingly.","1113":"it wasn't what expected","1114":"Great album with wonderful lyrics.  Doc and company keep you listening from the first word of the album to the last beat.  It hasn't left my playlist the entire year.","1115":"Lovely, I recently read how Buddy Rich was brought to tears by this arrangement.","1116":"Love this single it really speaks to your spirit. Giving you fresh fire to move forward in the things God has planned for you","1117":"I bought this after listening to Giorgio Tozzi on YouTube, and hearing his amazing bass voice. However, after buying this album, I realized that it does not capture his voice at all! It has far too much treble, and not enough bass.","1118":"This is the worse CD I have ever owned.  I was thankful that there was at least one song on the whole CD where Mr. Howard was not singing.  There may be another one, but I could not go any further to find out.  I wish Mr. Howard's voice was as sexy as that spanish guitar, but it just doesn't work for me.\n\nNext time, Mr. Howard, stick to the man-made musical instruments.","1119":"like this song","1120":"If you like traditional folk music, and you like \"Tom Dooley, and you like new Bluegrass, these young people do it well. They take some of my ole favorites and tweak em in a great way.","1121":"Uplifting and encouraging!","1122":"Be warned.  This recording is taken from a VERY noisy vinyl record - by all indications, a record off which someone recently had their breakfast.","1123":"I use this in my general music class- 1st graders to 4th graders love it!\n\nHere's the moves:\nCircle to the left- 16 beats\nCircle to the right- 16 beats\nStomp- 8 beats\nInto the center- 4 beats\nOut- 4 beats\nInto the center- 4 beats\nOut- 4 beats\nCircle to the left- 16 beats\nAs soon as the song \"jingle bells\" starts- pat, clap, partner, clap (2x) and do-si-do for 8 beats (repeat this step 4 times)\nRepeat\n\nIt's great and the kids love it- you can change the moves depending on the ability of your students!","1124":"Ralph is my favorite character from the Simpsons and this song perfectly encapsulates him (I mean it is 99% his quotes). Plus, I like TBG and it's just a fun song.","1125":"If you heard the original 1977 recording with Leroy Gmez as the vocalist you would love the purity of the song. This remake, i'm sorry to say, is an indulgent attempt by the singer to showcase talent. \"Over the top\" would be the best description. I'm so mad that I had purchased this thinking it was a remaster of the original. Some of you may like it. For me it was a waste of money. . .","1126":"I am very satisfied with this CD. Thanks!","1127":"I bought this CD per someone's recommendation.  I will never do that again.  I do not like this CD at all.","1128":"wonderful, uplifting","1129":"This is an awesome word related to God!  So powerful!","1130":"This cd is awesome help you to Praise God its wonderful too me and my soul. Nobody Greater and Can't Take my Joy Away are wonderful songs. You will be very pleased with this purchase. God Bless","1131":"This sounds nothing like the Lawrence brothers and would seem to pre-date their material. Amazon may wish to re-think this one.","1132":"Just wanted to buy and download where is my library ","1133":"Thanks.","1134":"This song is a powerful testimony that every saved person can agree with. This has become one of my favorite songs-I play it all day long.","1135":"I like the Alison Kraus version a little better, but this is good too.","1136":"Has a \"raw studio\" feel, if that makes sense. Love the song! :)","1137":"Love it!","1138":"Sounded great in the ads.  However, it only has a partial program.  I was disappointed.  If you are just looking for a couple of minutes to get a flavor of old time radio, this will work.  If you are like me and want an entire program, this won't do it.","1139":"People ought to contribute to charity albums and buy charity albums because they care about a cause or want that rare track from an artist who is donating their time\/song to someone else.  To say that Randell Kirsh, John Cowsill or Christian Love are of the Beach Boys is ridiculous. To say \"Joey Curatolo of Rain: A Tribute To the Beatles on Broadway\" who cares if you play in a snazzy Beatles tribute band? If that defines what you are as a musician then I don't want to hear your music.  I am a tremendous Beatle enthusiast, but please. The charity album is and always will be a great thing and I am not trying to change that, but please be honest","1140":"Beautiful, serene, spiritual music. I love it !","1141":"I'm a gamer, and I have watched Husky's Starcraft 2 video commentaries in the past. I watched the \"Banelings\" music video and appreciated it for its geek humor, though I'd never heard the original \"Baby\". Needless to say, I'm not a Justin Bieber fan.\n\nAfter making myself sit through the original Bieber music video, I have to respect the quality of the parody, as the Baneling artists (HuskyStarcraft and KurtHugoSchneider) do a great job of mirroring the original, and Husky has more musical talent than I would have expected. Though I don't know that I could recommend it to a non-gamer, this is a great buy for Starcraft fans who can appreciate the lyrics as well as the musical parody.","1142":"how can you review an album if amazon won't let you hear it beats me but there you you go thats the  way it it","1143":"Just a little bit about me, so that you can fully understand why I gave the review of this wonderful \"Meditating With Angels\" CD by Danielle Dove 5 stars.\n\nI am very connected to Nature, and Believe that nature holds the power to heal us if we can connect with it's healing energies. I am also very connected to Angels, and I believe that through meditation, visualization, listening, praying and envoking the Archangels and Guardian Angels, that they can be with us at all times, under all circumstances, and helping us with every aspect of our lives. I believe we can heal Physically and Emotionally by communicating with our angels on a daily basis from a place of love and gratitude.\n\nI Do a lot of Angel Work, Crystal Therapy, Color Therapy, Chakra Clearing and Centering,, meditation, Visualization, Guided Imagery, Yoga etc..and they are all connected. I also spend as much time in Nature as possible, spending time in nature with the living breathing spirit of Mother Earth and her wisdom, with trees, fresh air, flowers, water, sunshine, moon, grass, rock formation etc.. is just another way to reinforce the healing energies that are available to us if we can just tap into them.\n\nI have a lot of Audio CD's of guided meditations, imagery and visualizations that I adore that mostly encorporate Angels and\/or nature into them since that is what resonates with me personally.\n\nThe reason I am so impressed with Danielle Dove's \"Meditating with Angels\" and gave it 5 stars, is because she encorporated  the aspects of healing with BOTH Angels AND Nature. She manages to sooth and relax you with her beautiful Angelic calming voice, while explaining why nature and Angels are so important to our health and well being, and how they can heal us.  Danielle leads you through beautiful, peaceful meditations focusing on each Chakra,one at a time, to help you Clear and open your Chakras energies for more love, light and healing.\n\nAnother thing that I really liked about Danielle's Chakra meditations, is that she does focus on each one seperately for a nice amount of time, yet, they all seamlessly transition into one another. Danielle starts with the Root Chakra, and then as she progresses upward to each additional Chakra, incorporates the new clearing and openess from the previous one you just worked on, into the next one, then those two into the next one, and so forth, so you can really feel how they are not just all seperate energy centers within us, but are in fact all connected on a very fundamental level.\n\nI have heard some CD's where you feel almost 'rushed' to move from one thought to another, or one feeling to another, having to transition and visualize quickly in order to keep up with the speaker... which in my opinion, no matter how good the content is, is not relaxing or effective, because without being able to fully relax and open, you cannot get to the place of inner work you need to get to. I have several CD's that I love the content of, but listen to during the day while working or so forth instead, because they cannot relax me for a meditation sessiion do to the fast pace of the content.\nDanielle does a wonderful job of not talking, or 'moving' through her explanations or guided meditations too quickly, thus allowing you time to fully relax, \"sink\" into the comfort of her voice. and become still in mind and body, to be able to focus completely on what she is saying, and visualize it, and literally feel it.\n\nDanielle's CD \"Meditating with Angel's\" also has the most glorious backround water sounds that plays at just the right volume. It doesn't overpower her voice, or distract you from the meditations, however, you can hear it softly in the backround which is just perfect, and adds the extra element of relaxation and connection with nature.\n\nI highly recommend this CD! Thank you Danielle, for a wonderfully enlightening CD that I will treasure as one of the very best in my entire collectiion. I hope to see much more related content from you in the months and years to come!\n\nAngel Blessings!","1144":"Imrat Khansab does a great rendition of Yaman on this album. Not as lyrical as Ustadji (Vilayat Kahn, his brother) but the surbahar gives the performance real depth because of the lower tone qualities. Beautiful, and highly recommended for people interested in exploring Indian classical music.","1145":"Good song","1146":"The album opens with church bells.  Unlike Russian Orthodox church bells there is not much inspiration here.  The mass is just that, Latin chants for the components of the mass.  This music will appeal to those who are interested in Catholic church music.  This is music meant for the church and will not inspire most people looking for a concert experience.  This isn't the requiem masterpiece that Durufle wrote.  Stephen Tharp's improvisations add some spice to otherwise uninteresting organ music that accompanies the choir.","1147":"Its Large Pro!

This\nIs Beach Music i.e.; music for Grammies not surfers. Same with The Beach Boys an all their ilk who wanted to cash in on the INSTRUMENTAL surf interest at the time. Beach Music is music Music For Wimps and Philistines. Surf Music is for surfers. Get used to it. Check your history.","1163":"I love it, I had tried a lot of them before I listen to this one, I played it at our 6th Church Anniversary, it fit in with our Anniversary Theme \"Rejoice In The Lord\" It is very inspiring when you listen to it.","1164":"The songs that have Billie singing on them all fade-out prematurely and the second half is all instrumental. Such a waste.","1165":"This record \"Autumn Nocturne\" by the Ray Charles Singers is over 50 years old. As advertised, it is in GREAT condition. I had it transferred professionally to a CD and entered into my IPod. With earphones, there is no hiss sounds between audio breaks and the clarity is crystalline in sound.","1166":"The very last chance the world had to buy a brand new Cramps single doesn't disappoint. Because the Cramps are the greatest Rock 'n Roll band in the history of Rock n' Roll bands, in this universe or any other. Better than Meatloaf, even.","1167":"This is pressed in red vinyl - unfortunately the hole was off center a bit making it unlistenable.  I just took a refund rather than worry about if the whole lot was bad. Also, the label states \"Stereo\" while the sleeve states that it's from a Bob Dylan MONO CD.  C'mon Sony, wake the hell up, esp. at these prices.","1168":"Wonderful ep.  U2 rules.","1169":"Way back in 1986,  U2 released an album (CD) called; \"Wide Awake in America\". This album arrived in between their two monster releases, \"The Unforgettable Fire\" (1985) & \"The Joshua Tree\" (1987).  Their intent was to give the small independent record shop owners in the USA something unique and limited with which to sell. The record contained 4 songs in all, 2 live and 2 unreleased studio recordings. While interesting, it wasn't anything to write home about. Eventually over time this album (CD) became available everywhere.\nI mention this bit of vinyl history because that Irish band that everyone knows and loves is at it again with the latest release, Wide Awake in Europe. This time around U2 is only selling this EP (its not a full album by any stretch of the imagination) to the independent music stores of greater Europe. What is curious with this release is that U2 chose to release it only in vinyl. Seeings how the Compact Disc has been the music media of choice for the past 30 years, I find the band's choice of medium perplexing at best. All songs on the release are \"live\" recordings. Only the first song \"Misery\" is generating much fanfare as U2 has been playing in in concert on the current European leg of their tour. The 3 other songs are of unknown quality in terms of popularity. I say this because with these other unknown songs its pot luck at best, meaning they may be great or far from it. Only you will be able to decide which after listening to them.\nIn conclusion, unless you count yourself as a U2 \"completeist\", then you might want to skip this album at least for the time being. One song does not a record purchase make. So unless you're able to pick this up at or near the original asking price, I'd pass on this. This is the reason behind the rather high priced gouging  your experiencing here on Amazon & elsewhere on the web. This album is ONLY being sold in Europe and ONLY to independent record sellers that sell records, no \"big box stores\".  If history serves as any indicator, within the next several years or so U2's \"Wide Awake in Europe\" will eventually and quietly find its way on to CD at a more reasonable price to boot. Patience is its own reward!","1170":"Love it! Love it! Love it!","1171":"Ordered this record based on a recommendation from a friend who stated that Valens was the greatest artist that never was. After listening to this, it's hard to disagree. There was so much potential in the 17 year old that we never got to see realized, but what he left behind is a very small catalogue of well crafted songs.","1172":"Kind of bummed... thought this would have Kermit singing the song but yeah it wasn't him and not at all sure who it was... listened to it once and deleted it... wasted a buck :-\\","1173":"Another purchase I regret buying... This isn't what I thought it was and again I wasn't my money.  Wish Kermit had been singing it!","1174":"i always dug this theme song and Al Jarreau  made this song\ninto something. i wasn't crazy about the song's Production however Jarreau\nhad a instrument of a voice who more than made up and a half  of said song\nand its sound.","1175":"OK, everybody knows the deal with Charlie Hunter.  He plays either a 7 or 8 string custom guitar (mostly 7 these days) with some bass strings and some regular guitar strings, and fanned frets.  The set-up allows him to play the bass line and the guitar line simultaneously like some freak of nature.  Usually, though, he plays with a band and if you didn't know what was going on, you wouldn't realize that the guitarist and the bassist are the same guy, playing without overdubs.  On Public Domain, he plays unaccompanied, so there is nobody else to distract from the shear genius of his instrumental work.  The title of the album refers to the contents-- all of the tracks are old pieces that exist in the \"public domain,\" meaning that nobody holds the copyrights, so anyone can record them.  If you are a fan of traditional blues, jazz and folk, you will know most of the songs.  The cool thing is, though, that if you don't look at the track list, you will still have to think hard about what some of the songs are while listening to them because Hunter updates and personalizes the pieces so well.  The mood is fun, and the guitar work is as good as anything Hunter has ever recorded.  If you are looking for the more funk-influenced stuff he has done lately on albums like Mistico and Copperopolis, you won't find as much of that here.  This is more like his Duo album with Leon Parker, both in the stripped-down nature and the more straight jazz aesthetic.  Hunter is channeling his Joe Pass\/Lenny Breau influences more than his John Scofield influences.  I wish Hunter would record more like this.  His only other unaccompanied album (Solo Eight-String Guitar) isn't exactly a widely available cd.  That puts Public Domain up there with the Leon Parker Duo album as one of my favorite Hunter recordings.\n\nFurther listening: Phil DeGruy.  DeGruy plays a 17-string guitar.  No, that's not a typo.  He plays unaccompanied, and frequently records wildly re-imagined old gems, kind of like Hunter does on this album.","1176":"I've been waiting forever to buy this CD and when I found out Amazon had it for a better price I snatched it up. I'm VERY happy with this CD.","1177":"Some of the selection, were not recognized by me. I just did not the orchestra version of playing the music.","1178":"Five stars for recording quality. Four stars for Maria Da F, although it's probably not fair to knock off a star because she's not Amlia. But so far in my investigations of female fadistas, I like her second best. Which is saying a lot, because I've tried a generous hunk of them. (I'm not a fan of Mariza, but that's another story entirely.)\n\nHowever--two stars off because every one of these tracks is present on the 2014 release, \"Fado Essencial,\" and \"Essencial\" has four more tracks. I can't swear that the versions are the same and don't have time right now to check fado by fado, but I've listened to the one track that's titled somewhat differently, and it seems to be identical with the one on \"Essencial.\"\n\nSo sorry not to be able to give a more detailed review of voice and fados, but I haven't time right now and thought I'd get this up quickly in case it would save someone else $10 or so.","1179":"never in my life did I purchase an item expecting to receive what was advertise to my disappointment 2 songs only out of 12 was on the cd","1180":"Terrific show and great soundtrack!","1181":"Disc 1 of 2 was defective and wouldnt play.

This is only 25 seconds of the song!!","1186":"The beats on this album are so awesome and dynamic plus with amazing collaborators, how could you go wrong? \"The Big Bang\" is definitely a bangin' album!","1187":"What you hear in the sample is what you get. It is about 10 seconds longer & mixes up a little bit, but is the same back beat & about 3 different whale like sounds, over & over & over & over again for the whole hour.","1188":"i did not read the discription and it was a record I could not play not a current format  MY BAD NOT USED  NOT THE SENDERS FAULT","1189":"Lenny Williams is classic. The background singers are off key.","1190":"This is good music but the Trunk Records digital version of this album is a terrible vinyl transfer. I usually like digitized vinyl; however, in this case, the album sounds horrible. It is weak, muddy and full of distortion and static. It sounds like the end of one the the Disintegration Loops or something.","1191":"VERY disappointed with music!  Surprised how weak\/poor music was...CULD of been a lot better!\nBest of the DVD was Diane Webber on the cover!","1192":"Again.  I am starting to get as much exotica music as I can.  And also trying to get as much of Les Baxter's catalogue as I can.\n\nThe music is soothing, and sometimes exciting, but never dull.  As I have mentioned in previous reviews of Lex Baxter, I listen to a lot of his music on The Retro Cocktail Hour every Saturday night (even though it is actually two hours).\n\nNew to exotica?  Take the plunge and get this.","1193":"wife enjoys","1194":"Arrived safely and on time. Love the quality of the product, and looking forward to years of enjoyment.

Glad to have it but severely unhappy with the sound, it should be at least as good as the clips on TV.","1207":"Being a die hard Beatle fan I should have listened to my heart and avoided this. The only  reason I took a chance was the review saying it was a high quality recording! I don't think so! It is barely audible and makes the awefull versions out there of the let it be movie sound like gold! Unbalanced, underproduced, sounding like some Bobbie snuck a recording using a mini cassette recorder before closing down the performance due to neighbors complaining. Maybe someday I hope Apple will produce a clean remastered balanced version of what could be a great swan song concert and not the junk this disc offers! I gave one stat for the only highlight of this cd which is the closing number. Pauls Long and Winding Road which almost sound decent and has some nice Harrison guitar stripped down along McCartneys piano! Stay away till Apple does this right! Peace","1208":"I love movie scores, and I like them even more when there's extra tracks.  I had originally bought the regular edition of the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 soundtrack (I didn't even know they made a \"special edition\" soundtrack with the extra tracks).  I was scrolling through the music store on my Kindle the other day and found this track and two others and knew I had to buy them...they just make the listening experience that much richer and more complete.  I'm glad I made this move...I like all three of them.","1209":"A \"lost\" radio hit from the 80s.  Great duet with Kim Karnes, another 80s hit maker.\nThe whole album is a showcase for Meisner.","1210":"nice track","1211":"Love their music.","1212":"These remixes were horrible. The original is such a powerful song and that power gets lost in these remixed versions.","1213":"Although I do not like most of the Glee music I came to like this when my daughter played several times.  It's a good christmas song that hasn't been recorded by an excessive number of artists and it sounds better than the original TV version.","1214":"awesome song","1215":"LOVE MARY MARY, SONG IS VERY UP LIFTING... I TRY TO LISTEN TO IT EVERY MORNING... ON THE TRAIN... Smoochiesss...","1216":"I love Mary Mary and their past albums. This one was a little to the left for me.  It doesn't really sound like the soulful, Mary Mary ladies.  Let's do this one over please!","1217":"Just what I wanted.","1218":"bad mix","1219":"Poor quality","1220":"Dev can be heard on Far East Movement's number one hit 'Like a G6', but didn't seem to gain much notoriety for her killer hook. She's here with her debut single, and doesn't seem to be trying to do anything but get a hit. Music purists won't look at this song twice, and it won't exactly gain her a cult following. However, the hook is just ridiculous, and the beat is so driving that this deserves to be a hit in clubs. Dev may have released a faceless pop track, but at least it's one of the most fun mainstream songs out right now.","1221":"I was looking forward to getting this C.D ..I love Tom Petty & the Heartbreaks & I had to have this CD , But when I got the CD I was Very Very Disappointed in this Product I bought on Amazon It Does Not Play on Any CD Player ..Only on a Karaoke Machine .

When the days of cassette players ended, I found myself missing my ritual of playing this song each day between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I finally gave in and purchased the song again, and I do not regret it.  This is one of the hippest, catchiest renditions of The Little Drummer Boy ever, and, in my humble opinion, one of Alexander O'Neal's finest moments.","1241":"I LOVE THIS SONG!","1242":"Takes me back to my youth. I love it!!!!","1243":"I love this song the same way I love, \"Criticize.\"  How his words in the songs blend with the melodies from the instruments.  He is really cute too, the same way as power house Luther Vandross', \"Glow of  Love\" for instance, Chuckii Booker who sang, \"Turned Away,\" Rockwell \"Somebody's watching me,\"  Kyper \"Tic-Tac Toe,\"  and of course Tajh from The Boys, \"Dial My Heart,\"  which was a really great music video by the way.","1244":"shady nate aka shady acres, boi you hella rushed this project mane. rappers have to realize you don't need to rush music just to keep your name relevant. anybody that has shady's 1st joint, gasman unleashed can tell the difference between rushed and time. im sorry nate but i spent 7.00 for this and it is not worth it.  looking forward to that son of the hood joint coming whenever and quiet frankly should have come b4 this garbage. staying consistent is a must these days in the rap game, you can't just put stuff out that sound like beats that are rapped over.  im disappointed in the livewire camp for allowing this release to come out with no promotion or any attention at all.  get your new cd drop game up nate.","1245":"Listing his associations let's you know what to expect: Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis, Prince. It's funk, it's pop, it's my favorite Christmas song.","1246":"I love this guy's music.  He is bursting at the seams with talent.  He had a role in the film about the Irish revolution (The Wind That Shakes the Barley), has won Ireland's national story telling award, and has recorded CDs with the Fuscia Band, Captain Mackey's Goatskin Band, and two as a few as a solo artist.  If you like Irish music, you'll love this CD. De Cogain is the real deal.

I could not have been more wrong. The song starts with the typical Jagger swagger before trading off lead vocals with Bono. What shocked me however was how Fergie absolutely slayed the \"Rape, Murder\" interlude while putting her own spin on it.\n\nHonestly, I think this is one of the best tracks to come out of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame collaborations ever. Definitely worth the purchase.","1248":"So so glad, did I say so glad, I mean it, they rereleased this album.  I was heartbroke when I realized I had losted? my album over the years of moving and could not find it on a cd. Looked for it last year.  Love this album.

This Album was a hit with me then and still is today.","1257":"This induction ceremony concert was full of once-in-a-lifetime moments, and this was surely among the top 3 performances of the night!

The live performance at the HoF captures a good time at the party but does not capture the song.","1261":"Love!","1262":"My daughter thinks this is great music.  She has most, probably all, of this artists albums.  She enjoys the music while she draws or dances.","1263":"Wow! What a bright forgotten gem this song is! Totally worth $1 to own the mp3. Don't think twice about it, just buy it.","1264":"Bought a crappy live version by mistake :(","1265":"For Whom the Bell Tolls is my absolute favorite song of all genres of music, and all bands, and I hated this cut of the song.

I not only used a medley of Mr. Levy's music for our departments video, but now listen to his albums while Im studying for exams or relaxing.\n\nThe First Delphic Hymn To Apollo in particular lent a wonderful tone to our video. Ill personally always associate it with my bus rides to school, doing Greek flashcards and studying through the summer.

It's also got a few extra tracks that are sure to please any fan of the series. Who can't love Sarge and Caboose singing in character? Just a word of warning to something I encountered: this soundtrack does not include a clean version of the music played during the final fights in the show. Two versions are included under the title of \"Red vs. Blue\", but they have vocals attached. Not that I entirely mind, but if you're trying to find that particular track in a clean form, it won't be here.\n\nRegardless, this is an incredible soundtrack, and well worth the money.","1310":"I can't get this one to download.

I have listened to it at least once per hour since I purchased this song. Thanks amazon","1313":"Stepfanie Kramer is a classically trained mezzo soprano.  She puts her heart and soul into these songs and this was recorded live without computers to autotune, etc. like a lot of artists use today.  This is straight up unadulterated talent.  The beauty of these songs and her voice go together wonderfully.  If you are a fan of standards, you must take a listen to this one.  Track #9 \"Anyone Who Had A Heart\" is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard.  You have the voice of an angel, Stepfanie.  I look forward to hearing more from you in the future.","1314":"Very poor quality recording. Great variations on Jon's music it is just difficult to listen to","1315":"Redman has been my favorite rapper since he guest featured on EPMD's \"Hardcore\" on their sophomore album \"Business As Usual\". \"Muddy Waters\" is still one of my favorite albums of all time. I'm extremely disappointed with \"Reggie\". If Red was trying to figure out a way to alienate his loyal target audience he accomplished it with this album. Lyrically he is still \"Red\" but those tracks are straight garbage. I would expect one of these new \"Here Today, Gone Tomorrow\" artists (and there are many)to use tracks like this not a Hip Hop legend. The one thing I've always loved about Redman(his loyal followers would probably agree with me on this) is that he was always in his own lane-a lane he created. His sound was unique to him and there was no one else like him. He has gotten away from the sound and style that made him Redman. He is still one of my favorite rappers I just hope he comes correct on his next project.","1316":"It is obvious that Def Jam did not put much effort into producing or marketing this album.  It is clear that this album was the last of the contract and they're fine with putting out a poor product. If you're hoping for another classic like Whut? Thee Album, this is more like What Iz This Ablum? Redman has sub par lyrics that are rarely clever or thought provoking, and the disc is completely devoid of any fun even with Method Man's appearance where the two just do a verse instead of riffing off each other with their witty repartee? This should have been halted in production? Redman wasn't into it and it's a sad finale for a Def Jam great.  True fans will listen and enjoy little sparks of the old Red, but Doc is so much more than this.  However, The one thing I can say is that he at least tried to stick to his roots.  At least it's not rediculous autotuned metaphors worthy of a 12 year old which is what has become of the sad state of mainstream rap music today, referring to it as Hip Hop would be just too kind.","1317":"I was expecting the original version. It's not the original version and the remake sounds weird.","1318":"Not the original artist, these are other artists performing the songs and they sound horrible. Very misleading. If I wanted to hear a fake version I could've had my kids sing it for free. Not worth the money.","1319":"The song is hauntingly beautiful in its music and theme.  Scott Alan has written a song that not only shows Hadley Fraser's vocal range and honey-caramel vocal tones in the best possible way but Mr. Fraser's way of telling the story of the song is incredibly touching and dare I say it, brilliant!\nWell done Mr. Alan and Mr. Fraser, well done!","1320":"I cry SO MUCH every time I hear this. The song is beautiful, Hadley Fraser's voice is amazing and full of emotion, and it's an immediate heartbreak every time.","1321":"The music is beautiful and I love it.  BUT THE TITLES DON'T MATCH THE MUSIC.  HOW BLOODY HARD IS IT?!","1322":"I have Fenix Tx first cd and I would rate it 3 stars. Lechuza just sounds odd. Fenix Tx tried to go somewhat hardcore on Lechuza and they failed. The vocals are pitchy and the  songs are just bland. Nothing to offer for punk rockers like me. Fenix Tx just isn't unique. They are average pop punk rock and they really aren't that good. I did somewhat like their debut album,but it wasn't anything special. The lead singer is just average. You can hear pitchiness in his voice when he sings. The instruments are very standard for a pop punk band also. The concept for Lechuza is very odd and it feels like Fenix Tx just threw some unreleased demos onto an album. So,you really shouldn't waste your money on them. I would even give you my copy of their debut album if I could! Also,they sound very similar to New Found Glory!","1323":"Met Miss Lucy Lion many years ago at the Green Festival in D.C. She was passionate about her work and fantastic with children. Highly recommend anything she has written.","1324":"Beautiful song and I can listen to it over and over again. Kapena is timeless and I miss seeing this group!","1325":"Awesome Finger Picking!","1326":"After hearing this song and the lyrics in the video game, I really wanted this song.  It's a lot longer, and has more intricacy that was cut out of the game.  I love it!","1327":"Awesomeness","1328":"This file plays fine on my laptop. But when I sync it to my phone, it became something else!  Something is wrong with the meta tags.  I have to rename the file before I sync it to my phone to get it to play.","1329":"Very emotional and beautiful.","1330":"Excellent! I wish it came in cd form for use at a wedding!","1331":"Well this song had a long gestation period.  WE first heard it sung by Buster Poindexter in the late 80s, and have loved it ever since.  The band had a blast with the \"angelic\" backing vocals.  And of course we're fans of anything that combines Elvis, Jim Beam and Fred Flintstone.  IT's like something out of a Mojo Nixon record.  Didn't he have a holy trinity of Elvis & Foghorn Leghorn and.... I can't remember what the 3rd thing was. Damn!  Well enjoy. Another one comes out next month, - gh & the vj","1332":"Love this lp","1333":"Don't waste  your money.","1334":"You know it, you love it. Just buy it.","1335":"A classic that is 45 years old this summer.","1336":"i was also charged 2 times for this","1337":"This is not a good version of the song. The opening rifle shots sound like they're played through broken speakers. I basically bought it to add it to my ringtone collection and edited that part out.  I would not recommend this version for that reason.  There are better versions of this tune in the mp3 store.","1338":"Glory and praise and honor be unto the Lamb who was slain before the foundations of the world to redeem the lost sons and daughters of God! This is a great CD! GET IT!!!!","1339":"wow,my ears are bleeding. Why can't I post negative stars. I now understand why this so called singer became a western troubador","1340":"Good Tunes","1341":"Quite different from much of the new age music - you'll either love it or hate it!  I think it's a great disc for the car - good background music and very unusual.  Give it a try!!!","1342":"\"Take Your Time (Do It Right)\" became SOS Band's biggest hit prior to this album and they wouldn't score another big hit single until 1983, which means that R&B fans have overlooked the marvelous work that was done on the band's 1982 release. This album was not Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis' first produced work (Klymaxx's Girls Will Be Girls album came out several months earlier was their first) because they didn't have a hand in producing any tracks on III, however they did write \"High Hopes\" for the band of which is the duo's first song under their name that was a hit single (#25 R&B hit in early 1983). That song solidified them as cutting their teeth with producing for the band as them being the most in demand producers in the music business within the next 3 decades to come.  All the songs was produced by Sylvers' member, Ricky Sylvers (Leon Sylvers' younger brother) and veteran songwriter, Gene Dozier, explaining why the album sounds a little bit like a Shalamar album, but with major differences with how the instrumental arrangements was made (in which in part were done by Leon Sylvers himself). \"High Hopes,\" \"Good & Plenty,\" \"You Shake Me Up,\" and \"Have It Your Way\" were outstanding examples on why the album should have gotten the recognition it was deprived of. \"Looking For You\" was a bouncy track yet funkier version of \"Take Your Time.\" Although this wasn't the best SOS Band album (in my opinion); it was the best before they reached superstardom when black music made a major shift in 1982-83. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis would be the near exclusive producers for SOS Band by the next album, thus changing the sound and standards of black music with the heavy use of the 808 drum machines and synthesizers of which would also make them stars overseas as well. That is why I call this album the best before their best.","1343":"What does this have to do with Christian music category,needs to be changed!","1344":"I have a huge binaural collection. This one is a joke. I'm female, knowing that other binaural have much effect of me I was curious if this would work. It's nothing but jungle noises and birds going off. A total insult to the binaural community if you ask me.","1345":"Nice, little bit slower version of the song if you are trying to figure out how to play the song.","1346":"A must for O'neal fans!","1347":"Mr. Alexander O,Neal  represents a Soul Artist at he Best. His various songs are truly the style of the 70's and 80's with coolness of todays music. Great to hear him and to play him.","1348":"Good song.","1349":"awesome....","1350":"My girlfriend said that was so bad it reminded her of a college guy she dated that couldn't find her special spot.","1351":"I had high hopes for this, lord knows my husband doesn't help, but sadly there is still no boom to my bada. Get it ....bada -boom! Bada -Bing? I was trying not to be crass.  Anyway it may just be that I'm destined to a life of.  orgasm -less sex and you will have better luck,  I mean shouldn't one of us be smiling? Spend your money on a good vibrator and try try again....and again....and again untill I get it...I mean YOU get it right.","1352":"Same as the other reviewer, this is some sort of remix. Not the original I was looking for.","1353":"Great song.","1354":"When it comes to Christian music Caspar is the best in my opinion. He is a superior guitar player and the words will uplift you for hours.\nMy whole family play his music in their cars.","1355":"This is not a critique of the music, but of the distribution. The music is recorded as one long continuous stream of music, indexed into 8 pieces. Amazon simply rips the disc and saves them as eight individual songs. Thus, playing the album back as eight MP3's results in half-second pauses that at some points is quite jarring. Since the MP3 standard requires a (very brief) moment of silence at the beginning and end of every song, joining the eight songs requires a lot of manual work.\n\nSkip this trouble and buy the CD. Then use the \"rip as single track\" option on any number of available programs.","1356":"If you are looking for some new and interesting sounds to experience, then DO check out Black Holes and Butterflies. Great lead vocals.","1357":"I have to agree with hyperbolium, there are some originals, but a lot of remakes.  \"Rhythm of the Rain\" is one of those remakes.  It lacks the energy and little touches that made the original popular in the first place.  Your best bet is to carefully listen to the tracks, and buy only the originals.  Sadly, you do not get as many tracks for your money that way, but quality is something the record labels could care less about these days. It has become typical for compilations like this to throw in a few gems, hoping you won't take the time to notice all the \"filler\" tracks they put on the album to make a quick buck.","1358":"These songs sound terrible, definately not the originals.  Sound like bad cover versions.  Please avoid these 'One Hit Wonder' albums if you like the original songs.","1359":"Like so many other MP3 collections recently issued by K-Tel, this one is populated almost entirely by remakes. This is particularly egregious in the case of \"one hit wonders,\" as the artist's one brief moment of fame is hidden from unsuspecting listeners by these soundalikes. In a few cases, such as the Spiral Starecase's \"More Today Than Yesterday,\" truth in advertising wins out by relabeling the artist \"Pat Upton Formerly of Spiral Starecase,\" but for most of the cuts the artist is listed by their original name, and no notation is made that these are modern re-recordings. As with all such compilations, some of the new versions are truer to the originals than others; a few may even be the originals, but without clearer documentation, it's hard to know what's what.\n\nThe version of \"Liar, Liar\" that opens the set sounds like the original, in wide stereo, and Ian Whitcomb's \"You Turn Me On\" also sounds like the real deal. But it's quickly downhill from there. \"Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah\" doesn't approach the grandiosity of the Phil Spector-produced Wall of Sound, and \"Incense and Peppermints\" sounds more like a MIDI-arrangement with worn vocals than a psych-pop masterpiece. \"Rhythm of the Rain\" is sung as a folk song rather than latter-day doo-wop, and it's missing the signature celeste; several other tracks, despite good performances and solid vocals, shade the tempos a hair fast or slow, and have modern production that's too clean to reproduce the feel of the hit singles.\n\nNo doubt many of these recreations offer artists a chance to reconnect with royalties signed away in a flush of youthful innocence; they also offer die-hard fans an opportunity to hear an alternate to the well-known hits. But those seeking real AM radio thrills should look for a collection of original recordings such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Barry-Williams-Presents-One-Hit-Wonders-of-the-70s\/dp\/B000F3AJXA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Barry Williams Presents: One-Hit Wonders of the 70s<\/a>, Dick Bartley's One Hit Wonders of the `60s (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/1\/dp\/B0000032TV\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">1<\/a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/2\/dp\/B0000032TX\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">2<\/a>),&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Eric-Records-Hard-to-Find-45s-on-CD\/dp\/B00005Q6Q4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Eric Records' Hard to Find 45s on CD<\/a>, Rhino's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Super-Hits-of-the-70s-Have-a-Nice-Day\/dp\/B0000032R5\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Super Hits of the `70s: Have a Nice Day<\/a>&nbsp;series, or the treasure-chest box-set&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Have-a-Nice-Decade\/dp\/B000006OIT\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Have a Nice Decade<\/a>.

Their favorite song is Cannibal Buffet","1361":"The album has some great songs that are fun for both kids and adults. They're more polished than some of Voltaire's other music, and that's definitely a plus. The songs are great for a Halloween mix if you're looking for something different.","1362":"This version is pretty lame, not the album version, don't download unless you know what it is!

The 3 minutes is good, but not helpful, I was hoping for lots of pray and scripture references.  If the creature, made it a 30 minute CD with more pray and scripture referances, it would be amazing.  The content of the 3 minutes is good and the backround music, just not helpful, because it is a quick prayer, it doesn't allow you to enter into the prayer and to really meditate on enough scriptures.","1367":"Emily Howell is a computer algorithm; just google it","1368":"Don't buy from them. You expect a real copy of the album not something from a library.","1369":"After finishing Daveland, I do see why the memoir works so well. It really is a very engaging story and I personally identified with Marty's character as I had some struggles as a child with mild dyslexia and epilepsy myself. I can identify with knowing what it's like to be labeled as \"unique\" growing up... I think the most brilliant thing about this audio book is the vehicle itself - that Marty Castleberg is telling his story so that others that share his struggle might be able to HEAR it and relate or be inspired by it. With Daveland as an audiobook, anyone can \"read\" this story and enjoy the journey, both dramatic and humorous, and most of all told from the heart. I enjoyed every minute.","1370":"I was looking for 'Percy' that was the B-Side of 'Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer.' It was sung by a guy, some percussion, clarinet and tuba. This is a poor substitute.","1371":"Maybe my expectations are too high for digital music, or it wasn't meant to be heard with my Mp3 player.. either way, I can't listen to this. The intro seems to go through half of the song, and there's alot of background-noise that's louder than the drop. I don't think TI meant for it to be like this, hope this gets back to him so he can fix it. Either way, I'll be looking for another copy of this song somewhere else.","1372":"I am a student of Napoleon Hill and have most of his works in print.  I love audio books since I can listen while driving, working out, or right before bed with I-Pod.  This complete work is the unabridged (24 cds!) of his Law of Success volume.  The content is excellent and more thorough than \"Think and Grow Rich\" so allows for deeper understanding and application.\n\nThe length of volume and readers limited inflections (I assume he is not trying to color content) makes this monotonous for listening in long stretches.  That said, for 8.99 this is a truly great value and I would highly reccommend!\n\nI would also reccomend Napleon Hill -\"In His Own Word\" which is the author in is \"own voice\"!","1373":"There is something seriously wrong with the digital download of this recording.  It skips every few seconds.  I have downloaded many MP#s and this is the first time I have ever noticed such a problem.  Aside from the technical problem (which is severe), it is a beautiful recording.","1374":"This is the 1950 Furtwangler\/La Scala RING with Flagstad in a new remastering.  The sound is spectacular and we now have a new remastering that truly reveals the genius of Furtwangler in all its myriad orchestral colors.  The sound stage for both singers and orchestra is unprecedented for this 1950 Historic RING.  Never before have we heard such clear orchestra detail in such well balanced clean sound between the singers and pit.  Any other mastering of this RING, including Gebhardt, is left in the so called \"starting gate\" to use a horse race term.  It is truly SPECTACULAR!  It's as if, like AUDITE with their RIAS new radio master tapes of both Furtwangler and now Knappertsbusch live concerts of the 50's ARCHIPEL has been given new first generation excellent radio broadcast tapes; and with many of these broadcasts now being legal to distribute (public domain), that could be the case.  Whatever the case, this new transfer or remastering is a huge audio advance.  I don't need to repeat all the raves about this historic performance; except to say, NOW IT SONICALLY LIVES UP TO ITS REPUTATION.  The sound is now almost like excellent studio MONO of the first tier.  Furtwangler is the true star of this RING. You hear things in the orchestra that no other conductor finds; yet, everything seems so natural and just right.  All the motives are so clear and all the climaxes just overwhelming.  Flagstad is magnificent.  Lorenz is great just at the end of a great career.  HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!","1375":"I like Lift Every Voice and Sing.  This song has a special meaning to me.  The lyric to this song bears a special place in in my heart, The McHenry Singers did not do this song any good. I did not like the way they sang this song.","1376":"First of all, I did not like the musical instruments and nothing seemed to be to my liking. That is it.","1377":"Fun fun fun","1378":"Doesn't sound like nature anything to me......I wonder where this was supposedly recorded? Judge for yourself....missed the boat completely. I don't think the studio is nature.","1379":"Love the music.","1380":"Loved this song back in the 80s and still love it today. Absolutely one of my all time favotites and always will be.","1381":"Excellent version of this outstanding tune. Jimmy does it for me! I can imagine there is someone out there for someone to knock them off your feet!","1382":"Good song","1383":"Beautiful song!

Thank you","1387":"I really wanted a CD.","1388":"love it","1389":"Paul Smith is the best of the jazz pianist.  I treasure this album and all the recordings I found on Amazon.  He is an undiscovered genius on the piano.  Ann","1390":"Stupid","1391":"Actually John O'Banion's best album is the Japanese release \"Close Up\" which is an excellent example of how sometimes less is more.  That album had a different arrangement of some of the tracks listed on this album and some of the tracks here are not on that album and yet it still had a very nice flow and sounded a much more cohesive and hence much more enjoyable to listen to album.  Until we get a similar release of that album then \"Danger\" will hold the mantle as The Great Voice's best album.\n\nMy introduction to The Great Voice was years ago as a child watching a program on tv called \"Solid Gold\" which was a big hit at the time. I was blown away when this unassuming chap came on and belted out in an unbelievable display of vocal range, tone and powerful delivery an extremely well written song called \"Love You Like I Never Loved Before.\" I just loved the way the song combined powerful rock power chords with tender balladic lyrics which wasn't very common at the time but which was quickly imitated ever since. I remember ever since that night I spent many days trying to find that track somewhere on cassette but with no success. I finally found it on a bootleg copy of a various hits compilation (there were many of these in those days).  What my brother managed to find in the meantime though was an original, legal version of \"Close-Up\" or the Japanese version of \"Danger\" on cassette which between ourselves we listened to until all the oxide fell off the tape.  It was just that enjoyable an album and although \"Danger\" is no \"Close-Up\" I guess it'll have to do until we also get a mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version of \"Close-Up\" too.\n\nPleasant results usually follow the collaboration of great songwriters and great singers and we get no exception here. The Joey Carbone\/Richie Zito\/Kathi Pinto partnership on one side and The Great Voice on the other has resulted in a very strong release of love song crooning in one of its better incarnations.  Unlike the debut album which had one cover all the tracks here are originals.  There are many standout tracks here that show a vast improvement over the debut album release.  Tracks like my favourite \"Our Love\", \"I'm The One\", \"Deep In the Night\", \"I Don't Want To Love Your Love\", \"Through the Eyes of Love\", \"Take Me Back\" and the bonus track \"Inside This Heart of Mine\" are just very well written songs and the other 3 bonus tracks of live material add to the overall enjoyment of the main course.\n\nThe mlps release itself is not much to shout about not being one of the better designs and assembly that I have ever seen but the sound quality is very good. Also included is a foldout containing all the lyrics in English.\n\nFor fans of the early 80s romantic ballad genre ala Jim Photoglo, Paul Davis, Dan Fogelberg etc this release comes highly recommended!","1392":"Between the synthed sound track and the morphed voicebox, this song has become over-processed to the point that it's soul has been removed.","1393":"If it were possible to rate this zero stars, I would. If you are a curious REM fan, don't waste your time, even for free. If you're a fan of current styles of music, surely there must be something more interesting out there for you than a watered-down classic rock song with all the life choked out of it. It's mainly just the lyrics done to a monotonous beat with none of the build or drama of the original, and also not much of a groove, just monotony.","1394":"What made REM's version immortal was Stipe's passionate ownership of the lyrics.  In a blend of REM melody and vocal angst, there is a beauty and emotion that grips the listener to feel the song.\n\nColton Ford's version strips away the lush melody, and synths over whatever emotion might have been in the vocals.  The result is a dead-pan cover with all of the lyrics and none of the soul from the original, which makes me wonder if he ever understood the song in the first place.","1395":"The vocal has no artistry.  If you think any song will be better over wrought with synth, then you will like this.  I like covers, when there's an original spin, but the spin here is to make it sound like a million other pop songs.","1396":"Wow, does this song take you back or what.  This was the hit back in the day - - the drum and percussion in the back and\nthe fine vocals.  I can just see everybody at the party swaying their heads and shoulders from side to side - - yeah.\n\"Oh baby, you're the finest . . . .\"  So glad, I found this song! (LoL.)","1397":"Amusing but crass.","1398":"this song is really fun and uplifting. it just makes you want to dance :) I really like this song","1399":"Heavy music by some band, not the classic Charles Manson your grandma listened to.\nManson would be rolling in his grave if he was in a grave.\nThis listing is very deceptive.","1400":"I purchased it as a Christmas present for my teenage daughter and she was thrilled with it.

Winner of the 2010 SoloPiano.com Christmas Album of the Year, this album is one you will want to be sure and add to your Christmas Collection. Great job, Joe!","1405":"I learned of these guys from friends who saw the famous Letterman performance, and after wearing out their latest album \"Singles\", I decided to look back through their catalog.  They have some really great stuff, though no one album as wholly good as Singles.  But they really hit some high notes, and this is a pretty awesome stripped down (thus \"Undressed\") collection of four of their older highlights.  Highly recommended if you've heard anything from them and it catches you like it caught me.","1406":"I'm getting pretty tired of re-recorded work being passed off as the original recording. This stuff shouldn't even exist, but if it's the only recording available, it should at least be labeled.","1407":"i play this all the time i just love it i plan to buy all her cds\ncant ask for any thing better","1408":"This Price? This cast? This one was a no-brainer. Jussi Bjoerling's tenor voice is in wonderful form. Leonard Warren's baritone lends regal majesty to Amonasro. Milanov is a bit shrill, but a wonderful Aida.","1409":"Randy is a great new and upcoming artist.  He not only put out a great first song, but it is following it up with a second one with 1,000 Faces!","1410":"I love Emily Dickinson and this poem is on of my favorites and I'm glad to have an audio version of it to enjoy, okay later.","1411":"This cover not only sounds like the original, but it is truly a great lyrical song. I really enjoy what you've done here. One of my favorites!","1412":"I was suprised when I was browsing the new releases and found a new Chris Cain CD. I own all of Chris's work on Cd including the impossible to locate Christmas CD. I read one of the not so stellar reviews of the Cd and decided to judge myself. Chris's voice and guitar work are always a treat. Some of the material doesn't beg to played over and over again such as unscheduled flight or Chris's early works. Still a must for Chris's fans. Chris is a blues giant and a true gentleman.","1413":"I have been a big fan of Chris Cain for 20 years, buying anything of his I could find. When I saw his new cd \"So Many Miles\" on presale on amazon, I ordered it right-a-way.  When I first listened to the cd, I thought it can't really be this bad, so I listened to it three straight times on a trip to Kansas City.  It really is this bad.  Chris still has a strong voice and his playing, as always, is great.  It's just that his vocals and guitar are stuck in some of the worst songs I have ever heard.  The lyrics will make your cringe, and the horn tracks sound like a junior high band concert.  I'll never listen to this cd again, and I hope I can get $2 at the used cd store.","1414":"I listened to this song about three times trying to figure out why it didn't sound right. It is just a bad recording and part of the background music is missing. It's kind of like listening to stereo with only one speaker. That is the best way I can describe it. Anyway, I deleted it from my MP3 player which was sad because I love that song.","1415":"I heard this song on Open Range,and couldn't get it out my mind. I am glad I can listen to it whenever I want!!!!!  Thanks","1416":"This will keep your evening swaying for a quiet little party on New Years Eve,  It's ALL good!\n\nGo for it... :)","1417":"Ministry of Magic is my favorite wizard rock band. I would have to say this is their best album yet, which is saying a lot because the other ones are great. Ministry of Magic is so good at creating songs with great emotional depth alongside others that are super fun that you can't help but dance to. If you like Harry Potter, you should get this, even if you don't listen to wizard rock. Jason Munday has one of the most amazing voices ever.","1418":"I heard this song while watching \"The Pioneer Woman\"; it's a happy sounding song.","1419":"I don't like downloads, why no cd available of this vol 2 of 70's it looks really good? I like their other cds, such great idea for Christian music","1420":"Love'd it","1421":"Did not care for this.  I thought it was the other version.  Should have listened to a sample before buying it.  Ohg well.  It's just a buck and I can just delete it.","1422":"Was not the radio version I was thinking I purchased. It was Johnny Lee - but it's a very watered down, tinny sounding version of the song. Boo!","1423":"I stumbled onto Nicki and The Gramblers totally by chance. Someone sent me a clip of them singing an old Hall and Oates tune (\"I cant go for that\") in their van and I was hooked. I subsequently looked for more clips of them on You Tube and found hidden treasure. Nicki and her band are a group of very, very talented musicians. To anyone reading this review, please take moment to check them out. You will not be disappointed...","1424":"I bought this after seeing the van series on you tube. that was light bright and fun. driftwood was dull leaden and completely boring. I would not recommend this to anyone.","1425":"Have loved all of his stories since I was little. When I found out I could get them individually, I had to have them!!!!","1426":"I bought this because of the reviews. Obviously the people who reviewed haven't had it for a year. The hose at the base split open so there was no suction. so like other users I duct taped it! Tacky I know but I didn't want to have to replace the stupid thing if the motor was still working! Then the roller stopped spinning. I called the company and they said they'd replace it but I had to pay to ship it to (probably $40 - $50) and pay to get a new one sent($20). So basically I could pay almost what you'd pay for a new one to get it replaced !!! I am beyond sick of buying a new vacuum every year! Everything is cheap and made for crap!!!! They are made cheaply so you'll have to keep replacing them! Buyer beware!","1427":"The rhythm does not follow the original words of the song.  I purchased both the performance track and the accompaniment track.  They don't match.","1428":"As good or better than his dad at least more to my taste or likes really enjoyed the whole album.","1429":"Lukas Nelson rocks!!!!!I think he has a wonderful old soul. Bet his Papa is proud. Can't wait to hear his second album.","1430":"It is  two minutes of people talking and a tiny bit of music at the end.  I thought this would be an empowering instrumental song. Not!  It was not worth it.  Only 2 minutes and 40 seconds  long.  not worth it.","1431":"Love this tape","1432":"I can't give it ANY stars because Amazon's idiotic download system wouldn't transfer it directly to my Windows Media Player.","1433":"Vivacity, warmth and lyricism will take you a long way in Mozart - a long, long way - but not to the end of the line. That's the terminal of artists who contest his kerygma in their marrow.\n\nFor all her merits - and dammit, I enjoy this venture - Annerose Schmidtt (ARS) is not in that class. She's too Via Media for her own good. Ornamentation is feeble and contrived. More rubato would go astray - why be so literal and so often at that? Metaphysics is a rarity in this cycle - and ever so worryingly, one could extend this comment to introspection per se. Nevertheless, ARS is so much fun, if you're prepared to accept her limitations (and the not uncommon let's-sight-read-the-score moments from Uncle Kurt Masur on the podium), this survey from the mid-Seventies is compulsive. The full-blooded symphonic contribution of the Dresden Philharmonic is reparatory.\n\nK 175 - The Pocket Rocket derives much of its mojo from timpani. Here it is obscured by the (silky) strings. In summary, this is a thumper in its outer movements whereas the Andante is unimaginative. This is Three Stars at best.\n\nK 238 - This is a well-proportioned reading. Nevertheless, the slow movement is under-characterised - and who would have thought that such a thing was possible? This is a Three Stars job.\n\nK 246 - This is how to play the Ltnow! Indeed, it's the most symphonic version I've ever heard. While the slow movement could be more reflective, it does not detract from the wider affair. This is Five Stars easily. Great stuff!\n\nK 271 - This is the first real test (as some would say). Again, the recording is superb even if the piano prevails over the orchestra. The first movement is vibrancy itself but not much more than that (the same comment is applicable of the finale). While it might appeal to the Taliban, the slow movement is too fast and unreflective for my liking. This is Three Stars where the recording is solid analogue and nothing more.\n\nK 413 - Big bold and brassy - this is a performance of the F major Concerto like none other. It's almost a sinfonia concertante. That being said, the poetic elements are not lost. Five Stars in a canter. Great recording too\n\nK 414 - This masterpiece is played with ardour and delight with a piano-centric recording to match. I cannot fault this. What expectancy is on offer in the slow movement! How the orchestra sings in its prelude! It's enough to melt the sun. This could be the highlight of the set. Five Stars!\n\nK 415 - Oh for a more prominent timpani and brass - but man, everyone is betting the house here so who cares? Five Stars for sure!\n\nK 449 - Here is another massive test. Some - yours truly included - regard it as Mozart's greatest piano concerto. The Dresden Philharmonic offers a symphonic and yet-lithe-on-its-feet contribution. ARS could be more insightful but she's still great fun. This is Four Stars and enjoyable enough.\n\nK 450 - Lively, vivacious and perceptive, what's there not to love? What a graceful opening to the Andante! Again, a virile bass-line underwrites this venture. This is a Five Stars job.\n\nK 451 - Again, timpani could be more prominent. Nevertheless, this unproblematic work is aligned with ARS's skill-set and she does not fail. Five Stars!\n\nK 453 - This is another Olympian test. To a certain extent, the vivacity of the music-making masks the lack of interpretative depth (for instance, the episode-in-the-minor of the Andante is feigned). This is a solid Three Stars job. There are no complaints re the recording.\n\nK 456 - This side of the Pearly Gates, no-one owns this concerto. Anda comes damn close. Again, I cannot fault the outer movements - and I adore the beefy involvement of the Dresden Philharmonic. The slow movement, played literally, is not the last word in tragedy. This is a Three Stars job even if it held my attention. The recording is OK.\n\nK 459 - Again, I love the symphonic opening with strong bass line - and much the same could be said of the finale wherein double basses and cellos bestride like colossi. This arrangement is not to the detriment of woodwind. The opening of the slow movement could be more nuanced (blame Big Kurt as ARS seems to follow his literalism). This is a Four Stars recommendation (just), underwritten by a fine recording.\n\nK 466 - Notwithstanding its musicality, there's no sense of menace here. ARS is far too literal. The Romance is on the fast side. Three Stars and I`m being generous.\n\nK 467 - I can appreciate Mozart as Bruckner - that's what we get in the opening prelude of the first movement from the strings which are vividly recorded - but reportedly there's a timpani and brass in the score and one would like to hear them in this masterpiece.  The slow movement is enjoyable at its breezy pace. This is a solid, musical Three Stars job. Its outer movements in particular held my attention.\n\nK 482 - this performance is Plain Jane on a bad hair-day with zits. Come the big moments, nothing further eventuates - this could have been the genesis of Masur's reputation as a serial-deflator of tyres. The soloist does little to deepen the affair; the Greek Tragedy of the Andante is more like a satyr play. One Star is warranted.\n\nK 488 - the mojo is back in the outer movements which are great fun. Notwithstanding ARS's musicality, the Adagio is devoid of tragedy. This is a Three Star recommendation, underwritten by a fine recording.\n\nK 491 - a great recording and full blooded orchestral response are not going to redeem this semi-tough reckoning with the kerygma of the C Minor Concerto where Uncle Kurt sight-read the score on the day. Being devoid of introspection, this is a Two Stars job.\n\nK 503 - From the perspective of strings and woodwind, this is a great recording even if the poor timpanist down the back gets little airtime. If the symphonic response of the Dresden Philharmonic was ever going to resonate, it would be in K 503 - and it does so imperiously. ARS is a delight. Five stars all the way.\n\nK 537 - This performance features a great recording - for strings. Calling all timpani and brass - can you please make your way to the microphone! Enjoyable as this is, this performance accepts the Coronation's gallant credentials at face-value and does little with them; experience tells us that there's greater richness to be mined. Three Stars at best!\n\nK 595, as I undertook this survey, I became more and more worried for K 595 as it approached: at their worst, ARS and Big Kurt can be as brainless as headless chickens.  While I love the recording and symphonic response of the Dresden Philharmonic, this K 595 is as elegiac as a McHappy Meal. A solitary star is warranted.\n\nTo summarise, this is a middling endeavour. It has a place in the scheme of things. I can understand the viewpoint of the five-star reviewers: one cannot impugn its baseline musicality even if operates in a restricted sphere and its longevity is open to debate. This is damming in its own way, but if you're about to undertake an exacting road-trip, buddy up ARS and Uncle Kurt.\n\nThink not and be!","1434":"I have been collecting Winder Solstice Christmas CD's for years, this is another gem for my collection","1435":"Case cracked, disc scratched.","1436":"was not the picture disc, just a plain 45","1437":"great","1438":"Would not download completely so you wind up paying for half an album.","1439":"Excellent selection & interpretation","1440":"As Jennifer blasted it out, it truly is a new dawn and a new light for this song.  Jennifer adds a sass to this song that prior versions do not seem to have.  If you take Michael Bubl's version for instance, it has a great rat pack sort of feel to it.  His voice is all honey but it feels like we have heard it before.  Yet again if we do another comparison with a version like Nina Simone's, her version was sultry and bluesy.  But compared to these great renditions, the song has a whole new set of legs to it thanks to Jennifer.\n\nWithin the song whenever Jennifer's voice rises up, she still maintains composure and gives the track a flawless clean feel.  Even the instrumental in the background seems to take this same approach too.  I feel we can say at last that this millennium finally possesses the definitive version of this song.  Its amazing to see the kind of evolution it has gone through, and I can certainly say that Jennifer helped make it possible.  Bravo!","1441":"I've had the pleasure of seeing singer\/musician Austin Ellis perform at local venues here in Maryland.

The guitar, the drums, slide guitar, a glockenspiel?!, and maybe synthesizer too!

I have.\" He then inquires, \"Baby, can you see me now?\" Here in this tender ballad, inspired by writer Glen Hirshberg's Book of Bunk, Nathan displays his sensitive and attuned eye for poetic metaphors that are sparse yet accurate descriptors of love, hardship, and what is, at times, the inexplicable journey we're all on in our lives.\n\nHe captures what it means to be alone and, particularly, what it means to put love at the forefront of anything else that we think matters.\n\nIt is in this, with Nathan's sharp gaze at life, that his songs illuminate how we all are taken in and either worn smooth or left ragged by this journey. Nathan credits much of his inspiration for songs from the works of well-established writers: Hirshberg, Sebastian Matthews, and his father: poet, Marvin Bell, amongst others.\nYet, his songs stand as unique creative works in their own right as well. One doesn't need to know all of the literary references to still get his music.\n\nIn \"American Crow,\" Nathan describes his character Crow as a man who never stays put, symbolized by \" . . . tattooed wings beneath [his] skin.\" In this opening line, I hear echoes of the \"Crow's\" who have passed through my life. I acknowledge my own impulse to take flight at various junctures. When he sings, \"Black feathers\/Hollow bones\/Nowhere left\/For the light to go\/ Sitting on a fence post at the side of the road, American Crow,\" I'm reminded of Paul D in Toni Morrison's Beloved who \" . . . didn't believe he could live with a woman---any woman---for over two out of three months. That was as long as he could abide in one place.\"  I suspect that Crow, like Paul D, leaves because it's the only way he feels free, and it's a liberation that dodges heartache.\n\nNathan's songs lay bare the inclination to wrap ourselves in deceits so that we might avoid facing our own mortality and flaws. In \"Me and Larry,\" Nathan reminisces on his connection with the late-writer, Larry Brown. He sings, \"Somehow always in the end\/We become the tales we tell.\"  Later, he reflects, \"It was twenty years ago my friend\/When I thought that we weren't mortal men.\"  He traces the trajectory of believing in time eternal just where it fades as we approach middle age, an age when we begin to experience the loss of others, once young with us.\n\nBlack Crow Blue, however, isn't a bleak album.\n\nYes, Nathan writes about tough times, exploitation, and unfair treatment. But he never neglects the thread of love or shard of hope that holds us together. We hear this in \"A Stone's Throw\" when he sings of a man barely getting by, reeling from a bad economy and poverty. While others want to turn their heads in shame, the singer tells us, \"But I look them in the eyes\/Say man, it's me, don't you realize\/We're all we've got if we're going to survive.\" Ultimately, the song stresses that type of survival: through community, even in the face of unjustness.\n\n(A notable mention here: \"Stone's Throw Away\" was picked up by singer Lizanne Knott for her upcoming 2013 release Standing in the English Rain. She does a kick-ass rendition and arrangement, worthy of checking out.)\n\nOn the album's closing track, \"We All Get Gone,\" Nathan digs into a strict blues groove, his wailing harmonica getting as much play time as his vocals.  He moans, \" . . . I'm just traveling\/Watch me traveling away\/Cause get it right or get wrong, sooner or later\/We all get gone.\" Despite the resolute attitude of the singer, Nathan conveys a candor that is welcoming and intimate. I'm feeling as though I'm sitting at a coffeehouse table one dusky evening while Nathan strums, picks, toots his harmonica, and lights up the stage with his voice.\n\nThroughout Black Crow Blue, Nathan's vocals, measured and at times with a grittiness reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen, deliver the lyrics with clear-headed certainty of the stories he tells. His descriptive guitar playing, forceful when necessary, provides the clean well-structured melodies that turn his poems to song. In Nathan's writing are songs that encourage the listeners to claim the poetry of our own lives and to find the songs in others'. It's a good way to think about being in this world.","1501":"This is a must have for any lover of Christmas music or Jazz. Bobby Griffin makes this timeless classic his own.

Jamal's playing -- the only thing to recommend this travesty -- is of minor interest, drowned as it is in lungfuls of saccharine.  Grafted onto the authentic black art of Jamal is a sound like anxious muzak, the bland vocalists trying hard to inject something spirited into their craft as they race uncomfortably to keep up with his arrangements: a very unpleasant valley sunday it is, too.  This is Frankenstein jazz, the component pieces stitched together into a staggering, electrode-popping whole.  I suppose this crossover idea appealed to an industry watching jazz sales decline. (One thinks of Verve around the same time mutilating the late Wes Montgomery's Willow Weep for Me in similar, if far less histrionic fashion.)

The first track \"Follow the Trail of Blood\" was okay, however, I didn't like the vocal mix in Andy's voice for it. Then there's \"F**** Machine\" which has a killer beat which I enjoyed, I also enjoyed \"They\" but the rest, didn't work for me. Luckily, the new album \"We Love You\" is a major improvement. I just got a listen to that.","1563":"Wasn't what I expected.","1564":"This is based on the magnificent one-man play, THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING OSCAR, written and performed by Micheal macLiammoir (1899-1978).  This present recording is an abridgment of the text (which I have in published form from Colin Smythe Ltd), and it cannot compare to the original because no one had as beautiful a voice as macLiammoir (who portrayed Iago in the 1952 Orson Wells cinematic production of Shakespeare's OTHELLO.  I have never found the original recording on cassette or cd (I borrowed the lps from Library and recorded them onto cassette, but this recording by Gerard Plunkett is very good indeed, and it tells, as dramatic performance, the Life and Works of Oscar Wilde.  Wilde is, perhaps, better known today for the story of his life, and there are many fine biographies that tell the tale, as does Peter Ackroyd's debut novel of 1983, THE LAST TESTAMENT OF OSCAR WILDE.  Fascinating as Oscar's life is, it is good to see that his writings are now being taken seriously as works of literary worth (especially with the beautiful hardcover editions from Oxford University Press).  This recording pays as much attention to the writings of Wilde as it does with the story of his life, and the readings from poems, stories, plays and epistles are delightfully performed.  Plunkett's voice is beautiful and dramatic, and Wilde comes to life in this recording.  Highly recommended.","1565":"Awesome music","1566":"James Morrison has a soulful and evocative style. You'll listen to each song over and over, trying to soak in the lyrics as the melodies and vocals. Perfect.","1567":"This album has virtually nothing to do with William Blake, so don't make the mistake I made of ordering it due to an interest in Blake.","1568":"I really enjoyed the narrated section by Richard Bausch. His voice captivates the listener and transports them into his story for a wonderfully emotive experience. I have downloaded this story three times because my digital devices come and go, but my memory of this story remains undimmed by the passing of time from my first listening six years ago.","1569":"What can say? That I like the songs & music of this CD, that it has good Christmas songs in spanish.","1570":"I only bought this song to dj a party. They only danced to it for like 10 seconds then stopped.

Needs to be mastered properly.","1572":"definitely feels like you are on vacation in the caribbean listening to it. very relaxing and the songs you expect to hear on cruises and resorts down south.","1573":"Freakin' awesome!  If you like clarinet, you must get this.","1574":"Excellent","1575":"The classic song.","1576":"Although this is the second purchase of mine's of this artist, this is the best of his recordings I have heard thus far. The words of his music are relevant and the music is good. His soulful rendition of \"For the People\" is a good listen and bound to make you want to clap your hands!! This young man is very talented. The mixture of many thngs is on this album and I can understand why it would be his \"Masterpiece.\" A good buy.","1577":"I bought this album thinking I was buying one from Kim Walker of Jesus Culture. Was so disappointed to find it was not. The vocals are really not it. I have to skip the songs every time it comes up on my MP3 player in my car. It wasn't worth the buy for me.","1578":"This is the kind of album that I listen to when I need a good laugh. Songs like \"Unless You Call\" and \"Lonely\" are golden opportunities for this. The lyrics are just that ridiculous. To be fair, I accidently bought this album while attempting to buy an album by Kim Walker who is associated with Jesus Culture. Therefore, I am not the typical listener for this Kim Walker of \"Lifetimes.\" Regardless, this is music that makes me shocked he can make money from it. I have no idea why two other people rated this album five stars. But hey, whatever floats your boat! If you enjoy, then go for it. But I recommend to listen to a few samples before purchasing.","1579":"Beautiful a cappella piece that I find entrancing and soothing.","1580":"Amos Lee could sing the phone book and make it beautiful and compelling.

How in the world did this version get on the best of album?  The original version is a million times better than this, yet, the original version is not available anywhere.  What a sham.","1593":"Was good to be able to get it free and listen to it. Thank you so much for the deal.","1594":"Fake.","1595":"This is so bad not a single cd is going to play, I am really disappointed with this product people just try to fool customer, after buying just the menu is playing not a single song played...","1596":"Im a big social distortion fan. I love the new CD and the two bonus tracks. You need to buy these two tracks.","1597":"Let me start by advising people who are new to Mogwai, to not judge them by this song.\n\nI'm a big Mogwai fan, which is why it pains me to say that I don't really dig this track. I just think it's messy and unpleasant sounding, which is the polar opposite of their previous work. I've always been drawn to Mogwai for their cinematic soundtrack-to-your-life kind of sound... but maybe they've gone a little more experimental than usual. Still getting the album, but this first single doesn't get me too excited.\n\nIn the meantime, please check out their other albums, like Rock Action, Young Team, and Mr. Beast.","1598":"Another group that has trouble making music, so they distort most anything that they can to get kids to buy into this as actual music.  It's not, and good gosh let's hope this is a passing mosh pit fantasy that will soon evaporate.  Go to the MP3 downloads and check out  ; The Quebe Sisters Band,  Hot Club of Cowtown, and Tommy Emmanuel for something that will give you a smile.  The intricate harmonies that these True musicians have developed will make you understand just why those older tunes were so grand to listen (AND DANCE) to.","1599":"I grabbed this because it was free.  I just discovered Amazon's free mp3 and thought I would give it a try.  All I can say is I hope the other songs they have are better than this one.  This sounded horrible like static on a tv.  Yuck!","1600":"I've seen Beauty and the Beast a few times but no one (in my personal opinion), sings it as beautifully as Jan Ammann.","1601":"This album was not in very good shape ! I guess over the years one forgets how to properly handle vinyl like this.","1602":"In many ways I tend to view Klaus Doldinger in a similar way that I do Miles Davis. During his years with the fusion rhythm section Passport Klaus not only played saxaphone and composed all of the music but he also played the other melodic instruments as well such as the electric piano and meletron. Associated with the European music scene to such a degree they never got the type of international audience they probably deserved,Passport began their fifth album on the note of their creatively defining&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Hand-Made\/dp\/B001DJ7QC2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hand Made<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Looking-Thru\/dp\/B00005RZX4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Looking Thru<\/a>&nbsp;albums. The majority of those recordings were journeys to find what they came across here. A lot of people who have managed to discover Passport's wonderful and imaginative type of electric jazz  often describe this as their finest album. Don't know how I feel about that. But I can certainly see why someone might think so.\n\n  For one this album embodies just about all the qualities that make Passport special. There's the dreamy and often abstract nature of the arrangements in these compositions. Also the instrumental choices. The title song is the first example. Clocking in at over thirteen minutes it's an exciting journey from progressive rock type theatrics,into blues and than out and out funk. When Klaus comes in on sax,the sound he produces is rather soft and melodic compared to the phased electric keyboards,synthesizers providing the harmony. It's a beautiful contrast of melody and rhythm. \"Homunculus\" is very rhythmically flamboyant but again never loses that center of instrumental control either. \"Jadoo\" and \"Will-O-Whisp\" on the other hand,perhaps anticipating Doldinger's interest in film scores provide us with blacksploitation influence cinematic funk with a heavy dance orientation as well.\n\n  \"Albatross Song\",with it's breezier rhythm and the spare ballad \"Damals\" showcase the band itself playing in a somewhat more understated manner more in the league of how Klaus himself is playing here. Doldinger is a very moody player\/composer. Capble of being brooding and low key one moment and flamboyant to the point of being highly aggressive the next.  The rhythm section of keyboardist Kristian Schultze,bassist\/guitarist Wolfgang Schmid and drummer Curt Cress are perfectly attuned to these shifting musical passions he tends to have. Even though they are European and tend to be localized in that area of the world,I still have trouble understanding why their sound never caught on. Maybe it was more that electric jazz\/fusion\/funk-jazz anywhere had a bit of trouble catching in,on many levels. On the other hand if one is interested in this type of music this definitely stands as an important part of that genre as well as being a strong and important release for Passport as a group.","1603":"Good music","1604":"Boi if I could get my 99 cents back for this song and in exchange never hear or have this song exist, in a heartbeat, I would happily take it and exchange 89 of those 99 cents for a beefy five layer burrito at the local taco bell.","1605":"Not a huge fan.","1606":"great album","1607":"This song has a glitch in it and amazon worked hard with me to get a good copy and when that was unsuccessful they said they would refund the purchase price of the song but they never did refund the money on my account","1608":"Vendor MR. MAGAZINE is asking $109.99 for a USED(!) copy of Everest's pseudo-stereo re-issue of Cetra set 1248, which offers a radio concert performance of Puccini's MADAMA BUTTERFLY broadcast live from the studio of Radiotelevisione Italiana on 7\/26\/1954.  The performance itself deserves at least 4 stars;  the original monural Cetra transcription, at least 3 stars.  The Everest product on offer, however, is notoriously EL-STINKO.  And MR. MAGAZINE's asking price of $109.99 is altogether preposterous.  Buyer, beware!","1609":"It was a warped record.","1610":"I guess there are some that like screaming disguised as vocals and mindless, head-banging rhythm.  I don't.\n\n(re: earlier review) The Ramones never make me want to throw a shoe at my speakers.","1611":"It transports me to a huge stone  cathedral with hundreds of people bending to the power of the beautiful mystic chant.","1612":"The recording is over modulated. It distorts when the piece reaches full crescendo.","1613":"What is alleged to be a recording of Donizetti's opera, is, in fact, a rather poor quality recording of various roles Moffo (probably Moffo) has played in various operas.  Verdi's \"Caro Nome\" from Rigoletto is certainly NOT part of Donizetti's opera.  Skip this one.  The folks at Amazon need to do some work on it.","1614":"Would never play it after my first hearing","1615":"Its a remake, nothing like the recording that I remember.  I may as well have thrown my money down the toilet!!","1616":"Sexy, hot. This particular rendition supercedes original.

Great for managing stress.  If you have a discerning ear for tones, this cut is like medicine!","1618":"I think that someone, on behalf of all the people living in the China Towns across the US, should lead a charge into whatever recording studio managed to get enough people smacked out of their minds to agree that this should be titled \"music\" and thrust upon the unsuspecting populace. Good thing it was a free download, but I feel someone owes me something for listening to it. I would rather sit in a dumpster in a seedy back alley in any China Town in the US rather than be subjected to this BS.","1619":"I thought it would be orchestrated more, it is indeed charming, and brings back the fond memories of growing up with Arcade Fire, however, it does not do it justice in my opinion. It is really cool to see projects like the Vitamin String Quartet, and the performances are accurate and sound pretty good. Not my cup of tea in terms of orchestration though.","1620":"I love this band. Great singer.","1621":"NF is the best, I had to buy every album he got out!","1622":"Good quality audio.","1623":"NOT the actual version from the trailer. Sounds cheap and fake like someone rewrote it with an app on their phone. Keep searching til you find the actual songs by zach hemsey.","1624":"I am a huge fan of the Inception soundtrack. I was royally disgusted after purchasing it that \"Mind Heist\" was not included. So I got really excited when I stumbled across this single .mp3 you can buy.\n\nIt was disappointing, and here's why:\n\nIt's got the same general tune (and is quite orchestral and beautiful in-and-of itself). But if you want the exact, original feel of the trailer, do NOT buy this one. This one is nice in its own right, but it's definitely a re-recording and not the original from the trailer.\n\nThe actual original \"Mind Heist\" can be purchased on Zack Hemsey's website.","1625":"disappointing. it is also not part of the inception album. sample sounded better than whole mp3 so I bought it, but the whole mp3 was disappointing. i would rather buy from the inception album.","1626":"Yo wtf this is the clean version but it said explicit give me my money back!!!","1627":"I love the presentation.  It is as if I was with a group of people.  I have only listened once and it is a very good app.\nI will use it again and again.  How Beautiful is a good name.","1628":"Great deal, CD is perfect","1629":"This track is my idea of an example of perfect house music pump, in the spirit of some the greatest dance venues ever!

The songs are such a blessing to all who listen.","1638":"In fall\/winter 2005 Kris wrote several new songs\nand recorded\/produced my first multi track songs.

I think that's what made the\nsound of the songs quite unique and authentic.\n\nIf you like what you hear, you can support\nhim by buying the album or only single songs.","1639":"This is an excellent album. This band should have been a lot more famous and not relegated to obscurity. It's a mixture of heavy metal guitars and riffs mixed with punk speed and rhythm. These guys originally formed in Philadelphia in 1974 and then moved to NYC in the late seventies. They played live with the Sex Pistols and Dead Boys. Kurtis Knight, former band-mate and author of Jimmy Hendrix's biography, was their manager. If you are a fan of heavy metal and punk music, this is an album worth owning.","1640":"This is a LOW BITRATE RIP (RIPOFF) of the album. You will be disappointed at the horrible quality of what sounds like possibly a good album. I can't tell for sure--and I'm a fan of the band, DO NOT BUY THIS unless you are desperate.","1641":"If you are a James Blunt fan then you surely already own this album. His newest album he explores some songs with a different twist. Moon Landing has a few songs which explore the space race, (Not a new topic, of course) with some interesting songs and interesting messages. You don't need to enjoy space exploration to enjoy the new album. The music in this album is amazing and I play it over and over with the rest of his awesome albums. I have most on my cloud and they play for ever and I'm a happy happy fan.","1642":"First - contrary to above information there are images of this album available and there is an album available.\nI started work in the music business in 1972, working in the art department of the also legendary Charles Hanson music folios UK office.  My second job was with the American, however, living in the UK, Bob Wise, a remarkable man who revolutionized the world of music folios. And on a more personal note a man who treated me as an equal, and as a woman, someone with intelligence. He was a fine mentor.\nSo I learned a lot about music and songs putting folios together, and if you google me, you will find my name lised alongside others for various music folios.\nAlbum starts off with Dave's speaking about joining the 1957 The Greyhound Bus Tour (60 days) and he finds himself sitting with Chuck Berry. The opening track is a Chuck Berry Medley.  And Dave does them justice.\nAs he does with all the other great songs he recorded including Summetime Blues, The Everyly Brothers' medley, Buddy Holly medley, The Drifters, a conversation with Buddy Holly, Fats Domino and other stars also on the bus.\nDave adds dialogue throughout the album and it's interesting to share in the history of a remarkable tour, with so many stars on a bus together.\nIf you want a history lesson of a time in music when much changed, this is an album you should have in your collection.\nAnd Dave ends his 40 song album with a great version of \"Little Darlin'\"  and \"do we have time for one more....\"\n\nI have added images from the 8 page cover insert\/booklet.  Under Munday Images.","1643":"Glad to be able to get this song! And I love that it is available through cloud to put on any device.","1644":"Gabriela Anders has a smooth voice and it's highlighted well on this track and all of the tracks on her album. Her jazzy and melodic tone blends well with the wonderful music. This is a must buy and listen.","1645":"Awesome!","1646":"I would have given the tour 5 stars but I think the tour needs updating.  One of the first houses on the audio tour was used in FX's American Horror series but no mention of this was on the recording.  We found out from other people visiting the garden district.\n\nThe information and stories of the houses was very good.","1647":"This version by Teresa Teng is an oldie, but still a goldie and the best.  Paid through Amazon downloads and sounds great.  Easy to play too.","1648":"Really beautiful song, great singer\/songwriter. As good as or better than some that are out there.  Have bought several other songs from this artist and love them all.","1649":"This is a review of the song, not the album.  There are a number of good versions of \"All Blues\" out there.  It is a great song that has inspired many.  To my mind, this Ron Carter version is in the top two, along with the Miles\/Coltrane original.  So smooth, so warm, like a shot of really good butterscotch schnapps.  Makes you feel wonderful all over.","1650":"Love it!","1651":"A tribal classic dance cut!","1652":"Dag is one of those groups that are awesome, yet left the scene too early.  I have all of their albums now, and the money is well spent!","1653":"This song I remember ordering but I don't have it in my collection. I don't I don't I don't I don't have it in my collection","1654":"This is the best version of this song.  The singing and music are very soft, clear, and beautiful.  Anne Walsh has a beautiful voice.","1655":"What is x rated rap a tap doing showing up on one of the finest \"real musicians\" who,you know,actually played their instruments and uhhhh, sing and stuff like that. Potliqour,well the real band,not the x rated rap a tap group who stole the name was a fine group from the 70's and when I ask for the mp3 I get this garbage.","1656":"Thank you","1657":"This is a great worship album. It's simple and beautiful. I have loved Darlene for years but she is as close to perfect as she will probably ever be on this side of heaven. You have to listen to it for yourself.","1658":"Records skips badly in 3 different places.","1659":"I guess it's partially my fault for not reading the other review before buying this, but who would think that the song is misrepresented!  Disappointed that the song does not include Nicki as stated.","1660":"That wasn't Nicki Minaj on the last verse, didn't hear her at all on this song. Would've been nice to know that before i bought it.","1661":"Great to lip sync for a party skit!!","1662":"Really dosappointed that tracks 14 and 15 are the same song which is Solid Sessions - Janeiro [Chiller Twist Blue Line Remix]. Other than that, music is beautiful.","1663":"Best album ive headd in awhile","1664":"favorite","1665":"It's an upbeat and happy rendition of this classic Christmas song.  Adds a little spice to the old tired versions","1666":"Killer","1667":"Must have if you are a Telemann follower!","1668":"great song if you like old time country music.","1669":"Loved them way back when, still love them!","1670":"great!","1671":"Not the biggest hit in the world, but I like it enough to buy a good copy.  This copy was an excellent rip.","1672":"Sorry folks, the \"Seeker's Sound\" is very dependent on Judith Durham, who didn't participate in this album. Without her they're just fairly good.","1673":"Only two songs loaded from amazon onto my phone.....","1674":"Mom loves it","1675":"I didn't get there last cd, but I heard some songs from this on youtube and on a whim bought it, I had no idea what to expect, but what I am playing all the time at home, in my car and at work is pure bliss, this cd blends the brutality with soft passages perfectly, there is no weak track on this cd, music like this does not come around very often, i'm mesmerized at the brilliance of the cd, you don't have to like this band to buy this, you just have to like metal... if you do not end up liking this cd at the end of your first spin, your the one with issues .. lol.. unless something else comes out of left field and surprises the heck out of me, this is gonna end up being my Cd of the year, I know Amon Amarth is coming out soon and so is Mercenary but damn if they don't have there work cut out for them, this cd is a monster, it's epic, it's everything you hope for when you buy any cd and it's all on this one... Thank you Omnium Gatherum...","1676":"My mom like it so got for her","1677":"My husband bought this and I don't care for it.  I think he likes it.  He may never get arouond to evaluating it.","1678":"The other review is pretty on about this. Don't waste your dough. Find his first 3 discs or his Weather Report stuff.","1679":"Obviously just my opinion, but you'd think that someone as acclaimed as Bailey is and who's been around as long as he has could make better music.  It truly sounds like something a kid made in his basement - sort of a talented, but mindless wankery. I've heard play-along tracks that were way better musically, and had better groove. Seriously. It's just pathetic.\n\nReally trite, predictable stuff. Plus the titles are terrible. Who names a song Ape School? I guess it's all subjective though. If you want to hear Victor Bailey play, go buy a copy of Weather Report's - Procession, or check out his Trio stuff with Larry Coryell and Lenny White.  This stuff, you can truly pass on.\n\nJaco, I miss you so...","1680":"Kathy Sanborn is a throw back when singer could sing. The Chris Connors , June Christy, you understand what they are saying with great phrases.","1681":"This Cd is incredible from the opening note to the very last! One of the rawest, emotionally charged recordings of the last decade! David Binney is an incredible musician and is one of the greatest living Saxophonists gracing this earth! I cannot say enough about this album, so I won't even try accept to say... BUY THIS ONE!!!","1682":"Loved it and highly recommend it for anybody into Destini Beard and Midnight Syndicate.","1683":"Another wonderful song by Icon Of Coil","1684":"Horrible recording","1685":"Never grows old, just like the Word.","1686":"Not for me.","1687":"Nice quiet song. I'm pretty sure I've stumbled on other music by this artist and just never latched on but for some reason this song was one I just had to buy. It just resonated.","1688":"Was this collection of files played on a Kid's CASIO Keyboard? Professional Music? No professional Website, Commercial or Film would ever use these.","1689":"I hate this kind of music, and Amazon MP3 constantly puts crap like this on my list - why? Who knows...But it really PISSES ME OFF!","1690":"I can't ever listen to it.","1691":"Just as bad as their release of Red Skies. Rings weird to my ears that grew up with the original version of this song. Thanks, Cy and co for ruining a beautiful slice of what was good about the 80s.","1692":"Poor Recording","1693":"The Duke's the Duke, but this recording has poor sound quality and inconsistent levels. There are better recordings out there.","1694":"Great cd. Happy to be able to find it since it is older. My fianc was very happy to get it as a gift.","1695":"There is one word that is omitted (which is a technical problem) and that ruins the entire rendition.","1696":"Doug Robb comes across as a nasally high pitched whine in this, does not complement the pairing of Apocalyptica at all.\n\nIf you like the song but don't like the vocals try the same one with Brent Smith, much better than this guy.","1697":"Doug Robb's vocals are simply too underwhelming for Apocalyptica. Why this version of the song even exists, I do not know.\n\nThe song itself is still good, though; so I rate it 2 stars.","1698":"ONLY A SAMPLE NOT THE WHOLE SONG!  DO NOT DOWNLOAD NOT WORTH $1!","1699":"Not the version in wanted","1700":"If you are looking for the Learning Station's version, this is not it. They just sing the basic \"Tony Chestnut\" and it isn't really fun. I needed it for my classroom and it was pretty useless. Sorry.","1701":"Get some good headphones, turn it up and go for a run with this one! Picture yourself in some dark woods...","1702":"dude I can crank up the volume all the way on player(sansa clip+ w\/rockbox) and of course you hear mild hissing, but you can also hear the voice of the guy talking...it is a little muffled, but you can definitely hear it and understand what is being said, and I have a moderate amount of tinnitus, too.  lower volume on player and you can't hear it any more.  whether that will do any good or not, I do not know. Neither ultra silent nor subliminal.  but hey it is only .99 and I figured I wasn't risking much.  maybe it is just my copy....","1703":"Terrible. It's Chris hall singing but the music is terrible.","1704":"Posted this on a smaller release of this EP so I thought I would share the same results here, as this is just a more expanded version of the release.\n\nI bought \"Save Yourself\" on iTunes to give it a listen and check it out. It was the most horrible version of the song I have ever heard.\n\nAfter some research, I found out that it is indeed Christopher on vocals, but the ones performing the music has no ties with the band, Stabbing Westward. I even contacted Cleopatra Records, who informed me that it is Chris but not the remaining members.\n\nI'm sorry I purchased just the one song. The worst song purchase I have ever made.\n\nCleopatra Records has a history of releasing stuff like this. They just recently released a \"Trapt\" album titled \"Headstrong.\" Again, the vocalist, but doesn't sound like the band.\n\nThis EP is not only an insult to the band, as they really had no hand it's release, but an insult to the fans.","1705":"BUYER BEWARE!  Retro Disc International CDs are simply BOOTLEGS from Germany (sourced from vinyl).  Completely unauthorized\/unlicensed pirates!","1706":"As a great fan of the Strawbs, I purchased the original Hudson-Ford and Dave Cousins\nlps as soon as they appeared, and have retained them and a number of other lps simply because they were never issued on cd. As much mediocre stuff as HAS returned, when something HASN'T there must be a reason. Other than contractual\nproblems, the reason is usually that the material is pretty thin. Indeed, there are about 5-6 songs worth listening to on the three albums combined, and none of them come close to Hudson and Ford's compositions on the Strawbs' 'Bursting' and 'Grave\nNew World' albums. Dave Cousins' \"Suddenly Last Summer\" is no great find either.\nIf you like the genre, stick to the Strawbs reissues; the notes by Dave Cousins are especially enlightening. It's also difficult but possible to find a DVD of their\n\"Grave New World\" movie which is a real 'blast from the past'.","1707":"BUYER BEWARE!  Retro Disc International CDs are simply BOOTLEGS from Germany (sourced from vinyl).  Completely unauthorized\/unlicensed pirates!","1708":"The lead singer has a beautiful voice and their music is folk style without sounding like country music, which I prefer. Also I love the  incorporation of Irish folk songs.","1709":"Good LP to get Outlaw fans ready for a long awaited release of new material. Original surviving member Henry Paul and Monty Yoho surrounded by Original Henry Paul Band member Billy Crain and long time band members Chris Anderson and Randy Threet with original Blackhawk band mate of Henry Paul's,  Dave Robbins. Kick ass Southern Rock with a chaser of country. If you don't buy this buy the new LP. Live shows are great.","1710":"great music for enjoying and listening to a wonderful voice. unusal songs with great meaning and good sounds by a talented lady","1711":"bought this for my mother who grew up on Taylor Street and appreciates all types of good music.  She was very happy with the whole CD, and I could sing along with most of the tunes.  A definite success, and why don't we hear this on the radio?  Thanks for having it in stock.","1712":"dead to rights is awesome to hear it won't fail you when you listen to it for the first time.","1713":"I'd rather listen to the music that was listed on the \"plaque\". Did the producer spend any money to make this quality?","1714":"I was quite surprised and disturbed to hear an airplane fly overhead twice while listening to this rain clip.  I thought at first that it might be outside, but after a repeat listening and taking the headphones off to check, the airplane sounds are definitely on the rain clip.  It was very distracting to me and ruined the whole \"relaxation\" aspect of the rain sounds.  That is too bad, as I was really enjoying the rain sounds on this particular recording.  I have had to remove it from my playlist, though, due to the airplane sounds.","1715":"I thought that I was buying reggae C.D. This is obviously not the Don Carlos I was looking for. This is DJ Don Carlos, beware.","1716":"If you like earth wind and fire this Lp is a must, plenty of horns, drums, and some very cool gutair riffs,and great vocals.","1717":"I love this piece... Mr. White always amazes me with his realm of music.\nLight airy, brazilian influences and beautiful vocals...\nIt's a winner.","1718":"An intelligent artist that most average people won't hear. Too bad.","1719":"I purchased this CD as a gift for my daughter.  She is enjoying the CD she wanted.  I enjoyed the quick shipping and that it arrived in perfect condition due to being well protected.  The price was right and I'm very pleased with the whole transaction.","1720":"Nothing to say","1721":"I've been looking for this single literally for years! It's a very nice tune based on a Beethoven melody. I was happily surprised to find it available on Amazon. itunes does not have it! Years ago I tried to purchase it on a dodgy website and had my credit card cancelled! Thank you Amazon.com!","1722":"This is one of those rare cd's that you can put it on the first track and listen completely through it without skipping one song. also you can listen to these songs over and over, i've all of them 100 times easy and i still love listening to them. also a little side note, their concerts are amazingly fun and i can't wait for the 31st.","1723":"I paid for the song, but I was not able to play it or  even download it.","1724":"Ms. Owens was born to sing, here she mixes smooth jazz, bossa-nova & sexy\nluv balleds together forming a rich sensual sound.\n\nI would like to hear more cd's of this genre, sung by her.","1725":"not so good","1726":"I like the song but i couldn't download it","1727":"Great product thanks again.","1728":"Spiritual, sweet and uplifting unto the Lord!!!!","1729":"Grouplove have produced a number of great tracks on this self-titled release.  \"Naked Kids\" is an upbeat, catchy, winner and stand-out track.","1730":"Just awful listening to that drum drowning out a wonderful song.","1731":"The CD case came cracked.","1732":"This very fine group was on mp3 format. My personal opinion is that  purist will not hear the richness of their music.. The banjo has a tinny sound instead of the grand full impact that is prominent in mountain music.","1733":"Not as good as Border Crossing studio album (which is one of my favorite albums of any group all time IMHO), but still has great live music.  If Throwback ever gets back together someone email me.  Most amazing combination of vocals and solid instrumentation.  Would drive halfway across the continent to see them live.","1734":"This was one of those songs I hadn't heard in years. It just popped into my head a few weeks ago and I found it and downloaded it. I was glad it did because this was one of my favorite songs when I was a kid.","1735":"I cannot stand the new music that is out today.  I feel like I'm in a constant fist pumping club.  Pop music is now club music, as much of a fan that I have always been of Britney, I am not liking this new sound at all.","1736":"Ever since we had 3 out near the end of '09, I've been waiting for new music from Britney. And finally, it's here. Can't wait for her new album to come out real soon.\n\nThere is ONE thing that I wasn't happy about. Her record company had it exclusively on another site one week before the official release. I guess that was okay but most of us had to wait until the official day to purchase it. If Jive Records was smart enough to bring the official release a week early instead of having it just an iTunes exclusive thing, I'm pretty that she would have more sales with the song. Not a lot of people use iTunes.  Good marketing technique but not good enough. Either way, I'm just glad to have this song.\n\nNow, to wait for her new album to hit the stores!","1737":"She is wonderful! She writes her songs. She plays her songs beautifully.  She sings her songs. She has a great voice! Hope it isn't too long before we hear more from her!","1738":"Catchy tune","1739":"no complaints","1740":"Not good","1741":"I was looking for some mindfulness meditations for a group of college students.  This ain't it.  The reader's voice is androgynous and distracting, almost grating at times.  He sounds like an amateur who made this on his home computer, and he says things like \"allow the world to fill you up\" and talks about tension in the inner thighs.  Sure to elicit giggles instead of mindfulness.  Waste of a buck.","1742":"Great arrangements of classic Christmas music.  Wonderful collection","1743":"Beautifully arranged music that is light and enjoyable to the ears . I even  liked renditions of Christmas carols that I usually don't care to listen that were featured in this CD. It is as if musical fairy dust was sprinkled on every song .","1744":"101 strings is always great","1745":"It's fascinating that Mr. Tcherepnin seems to not be on anyone's radar.  Certainly he wasn't on mine until two weeks ago, but he's a wonderful composer and all his music - symphonies and concert music, is worth seeking out.  This disc is delightful - good sound and clarity and the music is tuneful and fun.","1746":"Lou Christie sang this song so good and he does his high notes to . I got this from 'digital music from Amazon .","1747":"Ty Stone is a talent, that isn't completed developed yet, but Man, is there potential here! Heard this song performed live in Jackson, MS as Ty opened for Jamey Johnson and Kid Rock, and he really delivered. It's a high energy, anthem type song, that Americans will be singing along with for some time. Great job Ty, look forward to the rest of the CD.  Spend a buck folks, help the guy out, you'll like the song for sure.","1748":"this song is timeless!","1749":"I'd love to be able to review this, but I haven't been able to listen to it. I bought this as an mp3 album. When I try to click on Download, Amazon tells me I've already downloaded it. And trying to get through to their (Lack of) Help Center is next to impossible. But Amazon got my money, so I guess that's all that matters.","1750":"I give one extra star because the singers are actually talented.  But seriously this is nothing more than barber shop.  I just can't give high marks to people that torture what was once someone else's good song.  I know some people loooooove barber shop, but then some folks like mimes.","1751":"Really, more of a 3 1\/2 star piece.  However, I found this version of The Final Countdown delightful enough to err on the side of generosity.\n\nA collection of a capella or lightly accompanied songs.  Except for Baby, which I find to be an extraordinarily annoying song apart from this album, all the songs rate at least pleasant.  Many of the songs reach all the way to quite good, and a few were absolutely delightful.\n\nI have listened to it extensively since purchase (admittedly only four hours ago, but it's been looping ever since) and am not yet tired of the album.  It features quite a bit of internal variety and has an overall light tone.\n\nI would definitely recommend listening to the samples before making a decision.  As taken with the overall effect as I am, it is certainly not for everyone.","1752":"Wow, yet another in a long line of daily bargain albums literally nobody with functioning ears would want.  Bad singers from a bad TV show warbling bad songs while hundreds of deserving artists go unheard and unrecognized.  I'd rather listen to my vacuum cleaner.","1753":"Music is life and my life evolves around all music. So new music is a must for all my downloading.","1754":"Love it. I love old time radio. Wish they also had a box set of mysteries like Alfred Hitchcock and the Whisperer too. Entertainment for your imagination.","1755":"This is old stuff.  I really enjoyed the writing.  Very gritty and realistic.  The one drawback is that occasionally, the audio is interrupted and a previous portion of the episode plays for a few seconds.  It is VERY annoying, but I was always able to follow what was going on, throughout all 50 episodes.  Great characters.  Lots of good listening time.  Made for some very entertaining work time.","1756":"Funky is the best. He is a great artist","1757":"Was good to be able to get it free and listen to it. Thank you so much for the deal.","1758":"It's ok","1759":"Emancipator is one of my current favorite bands for downtempo style music. I own pretty much all of their alums and would recommend them to anyone who likes this kind of music.","1760":"Music is life and my life evolves around all music. So new music is a must for all my downloading.","1761":"The music is ok for the most part. The only reasons I got this music, is because I knew someone with the last name of Hughes. Now I doubt these two people are related, or even the same person, so that is a long shot. The music was average, as far a music goes.","1762":"I got a lot of songs off of Amazon that were free and I didn't like any of them, including this song.  I guess it was worth the price.","1763":"Such a great album. The entire album is fun for both mom and baby. Music for breastfeeding! Why did no one think of it sooner!? Buy this album!\n\nI can't wait to hear more from this artist.","1764":"This is a great collection.  We just saw Paul in person at the Washington Flute Quest and came home to download this.","1765":"This one was a bit too busy for me. I couldn't understand all the lyrics...","1766":"Morgan's music is literally the morningstar to me: sometimes the only way I can find my way home again.  This album is on indefinite repeat in my heart.  Seriously, one of the most magical and haunting musicians ever.","1767":"These guys are better than Famous, They're Genius!!!  Buy this CD, Watch them on Youtube or Buy the DVD's.  They are an unbelieveable group.  Their music, some of it almost 40 years old, is timeless. Record Execs should kicking themselves for letting this group get away.  Doesn't say much for talent scouts.  TOO SMOOTH will live Forever!!!!!","1768":"Love this song","1769":"Fantastic Album! Can't wait for next one. Prime Music has excellent Christian music selection'","1770":"Not very good at all.","1771":"I'm 111% sure I didn't buy this, so I have no clue how to rate it or why I am bothering...","1772":"whoever this piece of crap is charged my credit card with this junk\n\ni never noticed it because it was only .99$","1773":"I am a baseball fan so this is entertaining to me.  While I enjoy the music, it is not my style.  However I enjoy the Baseball Project simply for the story in the song.  This song is no different.  It is a good story and a person can learn a little about baseball by listening to their songs.  However as I listen to it when I write this review, I find myself cringing about the music but sucked into listening to the lyrics.  This is a five star review simply becuase I am a baseball fan and enjoy hearing a good baseball story.  If this song had lyrics about barbies or trucks I would simply hate it.  I have heard their entire first album and enjoyed the songs but I do not remember the singing being this disappointing.","1774":"I like every song on this album. The harmonies are so beautiful, these beauties are really going places. I hope they get the recognition they deserve.","1775":"Love their voices and great family show","1776":"It's a shame that a solid talent such as that possessed by Jane Beamant is wasted on recordings by a 4th rate composer, to whom the pianist is married.  Perhaps that is the only reason she bothered to record these insipid and unoriginal pieces.","1777":"Great song and Wonderful Artists!","1778":"Love this song!","1779":"good some new songs","1780":"I love their sound and can't wait to see them live in my home city. Their sound is roots rock and is real original. Get the album now !!! Heard them on NPR and surprised they aren't all over the place. Just give it another year.","1781":"Not a great song. Too slow and boring. Good message though","1782":"Not that great. Would not buy it again.","1783":"I first heard this beautiful song at The Seraphim Center. We sang it to one person at a time as we walked around the church, looking into each other's eyes while holding their hands. It's only 4 lines long, sung over and over. It was a powerful exercise to remind us that we are more alike than we are different. \"I'm willing to open my eyes, to see your innocence, to see the child you are, a mirror of myself.\" This is on an older album of Donna Marie Cary's  and one of my favorites.","1784":"This CD consists ONLY of the chaconne, that is of 9 or 11 minutes of music. Nothing more!!! That is nuts. It cost $16!\nI think it was T S Eliot or W H Auden, maybe both, or Ezra Pound. Anyway someone said to be a convincing writer, be judicious in your use of exclamation points. But this ripoff elicits exclamations!\np.s. The music itself is stunning. Five star.","1785":"only 1 track on this Cd of 9 min length, prelude. Beware.","1786":"I do not understand but this cd has only a 9 min 11 seconds song which is the prelude. Where is the rest? $15 for one song? Can someone explain that to me? Thanks....","1787":"I was expecting the opera in its entirety, instead I was surprized to receive only a disc with the overture, which was expertly performed but all the same I was disappointed by what I received.","1788":"hope there will be more music to come from clara.  will keep watching and good luck!  if you haven't heard this one, watch \"lost girl\".","1789":"He is o..k.","1790":"I remember this as being the best prtformance of the Fetite Suite.  Gut only 28 minutes on a CD???  I can think of lots of things that would increase the value. The lack of notes is not a problem for me.  Anyone who is going to seek this item out doesn't care about notes.\n\nWhat would be an absolutely wonderful thing for this label to do is the first performance of Sheherazade by the conductor Issay Dobrowen.  It is 58 minutes of unmatcheable interpretation including a 20 minute second movement which because of its total spontaniety doesn't sound slow at all.  In fact its the best movement of a fabulously natural performance.  What EMI reissued a couple of years ago is the more politically correct 47 minute performance which still is very good indeed.  But, if you want the ultimate by a conductor steeped in this music . . . . . . . ?\n\nAnd then, there are the Glazounov 2nd, 3rd and 5th symphonies conducted by the vastly underrated Boris Khaikin.  the 2nd and 3rd, for sure, are superior to anything done since. Released in the 70s by EMI records in excellent stereo.\n\nAnd for more, the first recordings ever of the Prokofiev 2nd and 3rd symphonies with Charles Bruck conducting a razor edged French Orchestra seemingly made to order for this overwhelmingly powerful music which has since been tamed by many conductors but never presented as excitingly as this! A French Columbia recording c1960.\n\nNeedless to say I would buy these without hesitation as my LPs are kind of worn.","1791":"$15 odd for 10 minutes of the D major guitar concerto. Nice music, but what a rip off.\nShame of you Amazon!","1792":"This is a techically poor recording.  Some of the choruses cut out before they end.  The lead singers are mediocre.  I do not recommend buying.","1793":"Having attempted to listen to this CD twice, I wish I could say something positive about this CD. Thirty years ago I first heard this recreation on an LP by Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra. That was a tour-de-force! This effort is decidedly 2nd class. The orchestra certainly tries hard, but is not up to the challenge. The recording itself sounds like something that came out of Russian during the 60's. It's very tinny and closely miked. As for the conductor, it's either Alberto Lizzio or Alfred Scholtz (Both are shown on different labels of the same work).\n\nIf you want to hear this unique work, the recording of it by Neeme Jarvi and the London Philharmonic is fairly rewarding. That recording, on the Chandos label, is coupled with Tchaikovsky's 3rd piano concerto. But, for my money, try to find the LP of Ormandy and the Philadelphians.","1794":"great album","1795":"Shake hands with shorty is a five star masterpiece. The boys are amazing live. I appreciate their dedication to keeping the delta blues alive but I think they lost their way a bit on this one.","1796":"I purchased this vinyl because it was said to be a 180gram stock, but to my amazement it turned out to be a 140gram vinyl. I had never opened the package and I could tell easily that it was not what it was supposed to be. ImportCDS almost immediately gave me a credit for this item and this was even before I had returned the record to them. I would have to give them a 5 star rating for checking into my complaint and acting in my favor quickly! Thank you! I could not tell you if the music is as good as I had heard it to be, I never had the chance to listen to it!","1797":"The Dvd hesitates and skips","1798":"I was hoping for some great organ music, and this is the wrong CD for that!  I probably need to try another Paul Jacobs offering.","1799":"What IS wonderful about this is how it brings out everything in this piece, from the extreme beauty that Ives could evoke, to profound disillusionment at points. The orchestration may be nothing like Ives, but the fact is that Ives' orchestration is IVES' orchestration, unique to that composer's voice, and impossible to replicate at will. The playing is impeccable, and it is really a matter of opinion whether you consider this or Dennis Russell Davies' version definitive. It is a little faster paced in spots, and a little more clean, but the Davies version is interpreted differently. As for the Copland Organ Symphony, there is no doubt about it. This is amazing music, and everybody who has any interest in American music deserves to hear it.","1800":"Meditative and soothing, whether for a personal experience or a group activity.","1801":"Ethereal ....majestic .What I would expect to hear heavens' angels singing.","1802":"Excellent recording!  Laurisden writes works that are truly transcendent of time, at lease it seems.  I purchased all the Nocturnes from this album and have the other pieces on another album.  Anything by Laurisden is a bargain.","1803":"Arrived ahead of time .. no probs with anything.  In terms of this product : love it ~ love it ~ love it ......... everything I hoped for and more ....","1804":"As another reviewer noted, the volume on this recording is very low. Also, the recording seems muddy, lacking the clarity you'd expect from a good modern recording. This was most noticeable in \"La fontana di Trevi al meriggio\", which also seemed to take a slightly sluggish tempo.\n\nIn \"I pini di Villa Borghese\" many notes in the famous horn part were either inaudible or omitted. It just plain doesn't sound right. The recording also ended on a bad note, with a trumpet hanging over on the final release of \"I pini della Via Appia\". I will give some credit and say that I did enjoy this recording of \"Pini presso una catacomba\".\n\nOn the whole, it's not a terrible recording, but there are much better options out there.","1805":"I'd rather have the radio version that is played on Pandora.  This version is not as upbeat as the one played.","1806":"The movie soundtrack is mysteriously unavailable. This is the soundtrack from the original play. Yet this is stated nowhere. Very deceptive.","1807":"Exactly what I needed to add to my yoga playlist! Also a good track to play when you're taking a nice relaxing bubble bath or even just eating breakfast. Lovely track.","1808":"Awesome sounds the same when he sings","1809":"Omg desire is really red seeing red and burping roses","1810":"jazz sublime","1811":"Im not a music fan, but I love this song! I downloaded it so I could use it in a video, and now the song is stuck in my head. I highly recommend it.","1812":"Great song. Bad download.  Muffled!","1813":"I purchased this product because Amazon had given me a two dollar credit for an mp3.  I was disappointed that I can only download the mp3 if I download the Amazon music player.  I already have three music players on my computer, so I don't need another one.  Until they allow the download of just the mp3 file, I will not purchase any more mp3's from Amazon.","1814":"There are perhaps thousands of these seeming \"bargains\" available in mp3 format. I fondly remember my vinyl copy of Munch's glorious conducting, the BSO sounding gorgeous, and that organ.... It made the floor vibrate and my parents shout. This particular mp3 is the MONO version of the justly famous RCA Living Stereo recording. If you want the real deal, the true Living Stereo version is in fact on mp3 and and worth the price.","1815":"Not enough thunder. I would like more than just a few bumps here and there. Go record a MN thunderstorm.","1816":"I bought my copy in a small record shop in Nashville, TN (where BYOP is from). I paid maybe a dollar for it, and as much as I want to say I loved it, I didn't. Of course, I must keep in mind that it is first and foremost a demo, but a very poorly made one. I love be your own PET, though, and even though it was a rough recording, they still sounded great.","1817":"A remake of a good song, however, no one can compare to Cory Daye's original recording and this version definitely was NOT an improvement. The singers voice was too light, too airy and came off as weak for those of us who wanted\/expected Cory D's version.","1818":"I have purchased several of the Global Hypnosis MP3 downloads as well as self hypnosis CDs and MP3s by other artists (Steven Gurgevich, Erick Brown, Glen Harrold, etc..).  The Global Hypnosis CDs have a very nice induction period, which is long (excluding the extra \"Relaxer\" track) compared to that of many hypnosis CDs out there.  The voice is very relaxing. Some people might find the \"sound over\" (new age, storms and water flow) to be a little loud on these recordings.  The hypnosis session is really split over 2 tracks and lasts about an hour.  The suggestive script is split onto the 2nd and 3rd tracks.  The only complaint I would have is that there is a relatively long break in the suggestive script at the end of the 2nd track and the beginning of the 3rd track.\n\nThis is my favorite of the Global Hypnosis CDs.  I would definitely recommend it.","1819":"NOT original artist. my fault. Overed looked RandB Allstars.","1820":"Do not buy .The songs are,not the original versions\/singers..horrible CD..some amature singers sing the songs & they sound really bad .","1821":"What the bleep is this MESS?! I paid $22 to hear the original singers of these songs not some people I've never heard of!!!! I demand my money back! Shame on Amazon!!!!!! And then its supposed to be R&B Hits,  so WHY are Rappers Nellie and Kanye (there were a few other rap songs as well!). I was in the middle of driving from Ga to Tx and was in an area where I'd lost radio signal so I when I saw Greatest R&B Hits, I just knew I'd found some great songs to help keep me comfortable during my drive. First song was Nellie, I was like why is he on here and why does he sound so funny? Next song, still wondering why the artist sounded funny. After the 3rd song I exited the freeway to see what was wrong. I honestly thought something was wrong w\/my hearing! Lol How do I go about getting my $ back?!","1822":"Who are these people signing these lyrics and why aren't the originals singers singing the songs?  These singers are horrible!!!!","1823":"I really can't rate this item because the I purchased it 3 times and it will not download for me.","1824":"Very nice album from Spanish pop group, Amaral. Lots of new tunes, familiar style, fun to listen to..","1825":"My very favorite Michael Hearne song. It's a beautiful, mellow Boomer anthem...","1826":"excellent old song I knew it from the daei jan napoleon movie.. it's from the 40's ... I am glad I can get it again","1827":"NOT THE ORIGINAL!!!","1828":"can't determine if music downloaded, can't find where it downloaded or to what file....won't download from amazon music again, due to the complexity of the whole issue","1829":"This is a great album of jazz standards. I have lots of jazz LPs and this I would rank at near top of the list and gets played most frequently. Although Johnny is considered an R&B artist and later had a Funk period he does an outstanding job singing these early standards. Not much of his guitar playing comes through on this (Zappa names him as his #1 influence) but a great album non the less. A perfect album all the way through. There's not a bad cut on it , great for those mellow moods except for one song (Reconsider Baby side2 track 3) which is up tempo and performed in a more traditional R&B manner Johnny was known for in the 50s.","1830":"I purchased this LP before it cost $30 and was hoping someone had produced a CD of it. No such luck. There are only 2 or 3 songs I didn't care for, but the remainder is dynamite.","1831":"The words to this song has always touched me. This artist, who sings this  has made it slightly different with his rendition. His voice is rich and beautiful, and the song is  wonderful! Seldom do I like songs changed, but I love this! The same words and message is there,  but sung his way...  and God is glorified through it! My husband and I both love it and purchased it  with a grateful heart. God bless The Red  Mountain Music ministry  and  the man who sang this song.","1832":"The new Shun Ward LP, Prelude to Shun Ward City, is a refreshing alternative to mainsteam radio which plays the same songs in repeat. If you like Trey songz, Ginuwine, chris Brown, or Lloyd, you will love this guy. This is the perfect Valentines gift for under 5 dollars.","1833":"Why Devin isn't already out there all over everyone's radar is beyond me, because he has the raw talent, the grungy, rock sound and the earnest lyrics that so many are searching for. I usually tend to gravitate to one or two songs on an album, but I am finding the whole record consistently on repeat, and to be honest, I can not find a favorite among the group...each track has its own \"personality\" and keeps me hooked to my speakers for the album's entirety. I highly recommend this cd, and also recommend checking out his older ones, too. :)","1834":"I like the song.  The song is uplifting and inspirational.  The Women's Day choir found it simple to learn and loved it,.","1835":"Peter Baumann was a member of Tangerine Dream, a German band that was amongst the pioneers in the use synthesizers to explore new soundscapes. His first two solo albums Romance 76 and Trans Harmonic Nights were instrumental. In 1981 the vocal album Repeat Repeat was released and Strangers In The Night of 1983 is the disappointing follow-up. The vocals sound flat and it lacks the catchy tunes and synth-pop savoir fair of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Repeat-Repeat\/dp\/B000WQ9VQQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Repeat Repeat<\/a>.\n\nThe title track is the cover of a Bert Kaempfert composition from 1966. The lack of melodies renders this album forgettable although there are one or two exceptions where the earlier genius shines through. Time Machine, for example, contains a hint of the symphonic splendor of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Trans-Harmonic-Nights\/dp\/B001D797JE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Trans Harmonic Nights<\/a>&nbsp;whilst there a remnant of his engaging synth textures on Taxi.\n\nThe concluding Welcome is the only memorable track on this uninspiring album as it does have a great melody and impressive atmospheric arrangement with a cohesive structure. For great synth-pop that equals the best of e.g. Human League, Eurythmics and OMD, I recommend Repeat Repeat. The compilation&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Phase-By-Phase\/dp\/B000007TWJ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Phase By Phase<\/a>&nbsp;offers a mix of vocal and instrumental tracks that display a few of Baumann's greatest triumphs.","1836":"Excellent collection of songs from the number one 60's Spaniard rock band, together with volume II, makes a collectors or world rock a field day.","1837":"sorry only 2 songs on here are good the atomic dog cover which contains a mike hampton solo and the tune that features dawn silva is cool other than that this cd sucks.","1838":"Great to own if you have kids or want to listen to light but entertaining orchestral music.  I use it for many music lessons","1839":"My mom loves this CD.","1840":"The trumpet soloists, while very good, really rush the piece.  They get ahead of the orchestra frequently throughout the recording.  It really detracts from the performance.  I recommend another recording.","1841":"I first heard this piece, forty years ago when Jerry Lewis was in the movie \"Who's Minding The Store\". It wasn't until a couple of months ago, I heard it again on a local classical radio station \"Temple Public Radio\". Got it from Amazon because, it plays here and on Apple devices and the Cloud here is free.","1842":"Love it.  Heard it played on a typewriter way back in the 50s or maybe early 60's\nReally like it","1843":"Inspirational book with a great message.  I felt closer to God after reading it.","1844":"okay, but not as appealing as the original Dennis Day recording from way back when - the bells to indicate time for page turning are distracting- not as captivating to my grandchildren as it was to me- maybe media times have changed and this is the video generation -","1845":"Good memories and great song","1846":"don't make the same stupid mistake i did.  listen before you buy!  this is not the original track, just a pretty bad midi track.  like very bad karoke.  fool me once, shame on you.  fool you too, shame on me.  or you.  or something.  anyway, don't think for a minute this is the original track.","1847":"Good for practicing the Tango Line Dance,. Also recommend the Santa Maria Tango (longer and slower), from the soundtrack of \"Let's Dance,\" which can also be downloaded as a single.","1848":"This is not Leroy Anderson's version of Blue Tango, it is a bunch of old tango recordings from the 1930s.  I can only bring myself to listen to about 1\/3 of them.  Look at the product name and compare it to the album picture.  Misleading.","1849":"I love this song!  I've seen him live before and he's awesome.  however, I purchased this song and can't get it. I don't know what I'm doing wrong,  but I will NEVER buy music from Amazon again.  I'll stick to the Google play store.","1850":"I heard this song on a film soundtrack and loved it. Jason Downs is very talented as a singer and an actor, too.","1851":"it was a gift. they loved it","1852":"I enjoyed this song very much. James  Steele is a great singer and a wonderful guitar player. His music  is true rock and roll. I can feel his passion,for music in his song!","1853":"The beat was good but as you begin to listen to this song it just goes down hill. I made the mistake of listening to a sample and then bought it. I don't recommend it.","1854":"Awesome Riffs and Vocals!! I haven't heard anything this good recently. Cant wait to hear more of this soon!!\n\nAll the best with future works!!!!\n\nLONG LIVE ROCK!!!!!!!!","1855":"This is not the band called Gravel from Anacortes,Washington State,who did two albums for Estrus Records. This is just a band with the same name from Delaware,and the music is really horrible.","1856":"trash music","1857":"This is some sort of dance\/hip-hop song, and a bad one at that. I thought it was a Kiss single that I missed, and I'm glad I listened to it on MOG before hitting \"buy with one-click.\"\n\nI would have given it no stars, but I wasn't allowed.","1858":"Here are the English translations of the song tracklisting:\n\n3. So viele Fragen( So Many Questions )\n5. Warum( Why )\n7. So weit weg( So Far Away )\n11. Fantasie ist Energie( Fantasy Is Energy )\n13. Mondlied( Moon Song )\n15. Zeichne mir dein Herz( Show Me Your Heart )\n17. Schnell, schnell( Quickly, Quickly )\n18. Die Sterne( The Stars )\n\nThe other tracks are the overture and narrations in German about the story of Madou.","1859":"Love the Ten!","1860":"....I ordered thinking these were mainly DOG songs.  BE ADVISED ..... Only 1 -2 dog related.  SHOULD NOT BE TITLED \"THE DOG\"","1861":"I got 10 records as promised, i wouldn't call them LPs, most of them were less than half filled, most just demos from various unknown artists, some even unlabeled. they may be used for scratching later on if i ever decide to get into that.","1862":"Would not play on my computer","1863":"Love her voice and the song is good. Her songs have a twang but not too much but most her songs are of broken hearts","1864":"Just some old rough cuts, the one hit wonder \"not gonna take it\" not included.","1865":"I expected Sugar Pie Guy by the Joneses. I was disappointed after purchasing to discover it was not what I wanted.","1866":"Llegada del producto en excelentes condiciones, se probo y todo bien,sin dao alguno, que da confianza para seguir comprando productos.-","1867":"Can't get enough of his music.","1868":"Tried to order the one off the Lose Control Album, this sounds horrible. I did order the correct one","1869":"Three of the best on one CD. Good compliment to the RUF collection.","1870":"loved the song but didn't read close enough only 2 songs on cd","1871":"Brenda Russell is one of my all time favorites. Every few years she releases a CD that is enormously pleasurable. Love Life is an early effort and sounds like it. It sounds as if there is only one \"musician\" on all the tracks and everything is over dubbed. The lyrics - if they can  be called that - are insipid. Russell sounds tired. Best avoided.","1872":"The copy I received has the look of a bootleg CD...\nThe disk does not even play on my CD player! I was however able to read it on my DVD player.\nThe artwork seems to have been printed on an inkjet printer. The last straw is that there are no program notes.\n\nWhat can I say, I am shocked!\n\nRare repertory, very well interpreted by McAslan and Blakely, it's an INSULT that the medium is not up to par.","1873":"Rabbath & his friends are \"the greatest.\"","1874":"Awesome songs from Jamalski, DJ Koda and the team.  Well worth the listen.","1875":"Nice smooth piano jazz.","1876":"The GRAMMAPHONE review, with its insider cracks about Warlock, is accurate to a degree, but might be demanding the wrong thing from Warlock and from this album, which remains one of my favorite Xmas albums precisely because its tone is not too resolutely jolly and its archaisms are interesting time and again. And I don't like Britten's Festival.","1877":"Sounds like a soundtrack for a Sixties B-movie featuring lots of women in bouffant hairdos and heels. Laughably ticky-tacky. Buy any CD by Paolo Conte instead.","1878":"If you're looking for *real* Gregorian chant, look elsewhere.  This is all synthesized--voices, \"organ\", everything--and the resulting sound is harsh and unpleasant. I didn't hear any actual words, either, just the same repetitive \"ee-oh\", \"ay-oh\", and what sounded like\"me-ow\" in occasion.","1879":"I've been using this as background music at work - it's soothing without putting me to sleep. Very nice.","1880":"I bought this song because my girlfriend wanted it. Now neither of us listen to it. Just not our style, I guess.","1881":"Slightly different versions than what you will find on YouTube, But still beautiful.","1882":"This must be one of Aster's best albums and possibly the best.  I enjoyed every track on the album and recommend it all for music lovers even if they don't understand the lyrics.","1883":"This is an amazing and life-changing CD. I have listened to it a million times and never got tired of it. Inspiring, funny and full of ass-kicking, great advice to get you going, to reach for the stars, to raise your standards!","1884":"Off key and not the original. Should be renamed wkrap. If your looking for the original look elsewhere. Absolute junk.","1885":"This is not the TV version of the song but another version by some guy.  He is a good singer, but it's not what you are used to.","1886":"This son reminds me of the person that I love and want to spend the rest of the my life with.  It really speaks to what her and I have gone through.","1887":"this music sucks and represents all lousy musical-ness,without repeating the m- word,(\"mu-ic\"), and I can only hope that the Amazon 'bot does not send me any more recommendations representing Visqueen and Yarnel. Thank you.","1888":"liked","1889":"If you love folk and Alaskan music this is the best you will ever own.","1890":"Don Schultz, Loren Arment, Goodwin Trent, Dana Cox, and Kathryn Cox were the artist that made up this groundbreaking Alaskan folk band from the 1970's.  Don Schultz's impeccable banjo carried many of their tunes, along with the lilting voice of Dana Cox and the superb harmonies of Loren, Kathryn, and Goodwin. The producer, John Speer, did a remarkable job of arranging and recording the music along with Don Schultz.  The Last Frontier Band is and was the first band to really set the bar for Alaskan recording artists, and I have yet to see an album of its caliber since.  Except of course, Dana Cox's solo album from the 1980's.\nThe folk standard Wayfarin' Stranger, is enchanting.  Trees, written by Goodwin Trent is a classic flower child song of the time period. Traveling Lady, sung by Dana Cox is haunting. Save The Whales, sung to the tune of The Drunken Sailor inspires dreams of the good ole days when the whales were hunted almost to extinction.  A few years ago, I contacted John Speer about re-releasing this album on CD, but that has yet to come about.","1891":"its an interveiw with 19 talkings sessions it sucks.","1892":"I love this song","1893":"This song is en vogue again and may recall babies on a youtube video or the singer herself,  but its just plain fun fun fun. I really wish I had grown up hearing this song. I would have really loved singing it when I was little as I do now. If you like this song and singer you will also like brandy carlie. (Sp?)  Similar bizarre intonations and unexpected inflections.","1894":"It wasn't anythink that anyone did, but I wanted the original song, and the one I got is not . So I guess I should of previewed it longer.","1895":"just hate this version.  deleted immediately.  wanted \"real\" radio version.  waste of .99\n\nseven more words required.  seven more words","1896":"They just don't sing the good stuff much any more, Found this guy Hooker, Bobby Flores and Justin Trevino. Bought 7 cd's, Listen to them and can say I can now throw all my other country music in the trash!! This music is it!! If you like real country music and dance hall stuff, this is it!!  NOW MY FAVORITE!!!\n\nThis Hooker guy appears to be one of those most guys would consider \"Cool\". I am in my mid forties, law enforcement over 20 yrs and would hang out with these guys!!!","1897":"love this song","1898":"Wonderful voice, great instrumental group, vibrant recording.","1899":"I expected jodel tunes. There were much fewer than I was expecting.  I was not happy with this.  The reason to buy Oesch Die Dritten is to hear jodel.  Forget this.","1900":"Love this arrangement.  I only wish it was longer so it included more of the original lyrics.  They should also publish sheet music.","1901":"GREAT","1902":"Original teen titans theme song. My kids listen to it over and over.","1903":"great song","1904":"Reprise has a gorgeous sound, with rich harmonies and an intimate style. I enjoy the group a cappella numbers the most, although their solos are also good. Highly recommended.","1905":"I compared this to another song and it's different.  For some strange reason, the flute part in the beginning is missing.  That's the part that I like the most, so I have to say don't get this track.  Not worth it.  Go to another site to get the song.  Other than that, Miho's voice is amazing as always.","1906":"This item was purchased as a gift, the recipient is happy and I am very happy with the item, the service and everything overall!! :)\nThank you!!!","1907":"amazing voice - not good song choices tho","1908":"bad... wouldn't recommend","1909":"While I have the excellent studio recording of the Sutherland-Pavarotti \"La Sonnambula\", this live recording of early Sutherland is spectacular.  Her high notes are off the chart and her diction is rather good compared to her later years.  Not listening to \"La Sonnambula\" often, one forgets what great music is in this wonderful Bellini opera.  A \"must have\" for any Sutherland and \"La Sonnambula\" lover.","1910":"love this song","1911":"Great song.","1912":"Product as expected","1913":"Listen to the previews here and decide.\n\nI enjoy this album because it's not too 'pop' sounding.  The vocals never get too tinny or 'cutesy' sounding.  Instead it's a nice mix of light rock, pop, and punk that has very nice variety.  It's a steal at under $10 for the download.  I put it on the Amazon cloud then loaded it to my computer, iPod Shuffle (for running), and my phone.  I really did the tunes while running or working out.  The quicker tempos make for a nice upbeat workout mix.\n\nWish more American bands were like this!","1914":"Confab's ear socket searing riffs melted my mind with their technicality, and the melodies and hooks were like that of an angelic phonic goddess, caressing my soul with her inconceivably luscious auditory arms that wrapped themselves around me, like a warm blanket on a cold day.. comforting me in this post-apocalyptic rock suck-o-sphere that has become the music industry today. God bless you, Confab.","1915":"just got into billy falcon music. what a great song writer wonderfull story telling, less of a rocky influence than the great pretty blue world cd,  but some great lyric's, well worth the money ,","1916":"Great album by Billy Falcon....singer songwriter...great words and music... writes on many of Bon Jovi's album with Jon and Richie...","1917":"Great song from one twelve definitely one of the classic r&b jams. You b can't  go wrong with this single.","1918":"Many have written here that this is not the best collection of Bruce Cockburn's work. I'm not a mind reader or a seer, so I'm thinking those are evaluations made by people who have always had easy access to his recorded music. I, and I'd guess many others, have not had that easy access. My work life has always kept me in places where his music was not available. I don't have all of Mr Cockburn's albums in my collection. So, what does this all mean? Simply that I am absolutely satisfied with this collection of Bruce Cockburn's music. There are many songs in this collection that I've never heard. They are as good as all the music I've become familiar with in years previous. If you're a person who has collected most, if not all, of Mr Cockburn's music, you may be disappointed with this anthology. If you're someone like me, without that all encompassing collection, I'll bet that you'd enjoy this compilation immensely. I'll be listening to this one until it's no longer playable. I gave it five stars. I mean it.","1919":"I have purchased every single release of Bruce's.  The message I get is that if I want the concert DVD and rarities disc, I have to pay well over $100.  Bruce's marketing team has found a way to thumb their noses to the core of his fan base.  Curious.","1920":"Five stars for the music.  One star for the absence of consideration to avid fans that went into this box set.  There are many rarities that are still \"out there\" that could have been included, and which would have brought something fresh to this collection. Instead, you get 6 CD's of music that has been available for years on the official releases; one disc of \"rarities\", although many of these supposed rarities are available on other compilations that are readily available; and a single DVD of an acoustic tour that Bruce did a few years ago.  Talk about a missed opportunity!  How difficult would it have been to include missing B sides that never made it to CD?  Or rarities that are only available on hard-to-find and out-of-print CD's?  And why not include a DVD of the movie \"Rumours of Glory\" that came out in the 80's, or any number of other live performances that would have made fantastic DVD's?  Bruce is a significant artist with some very devoted fans.  They deserve more than this wasted opportunity to produce a meaningful box set.  Thumbs up for the music.  Thumbs down for the absence of imagination that went into this once in a career box set.\n\nNOTE: After receiving in the mail the AMAZING Wilco box set that was just released this week, I have had to lower my review of Bruce's box set.  Wilco shows what it is like to approach fans with imagination and integrity.  Bruce's team rather shrewdly was able to convince a fan like me to spend over $100 for a single CD of music of \"rarities\" -- many of which I already own -- and a DVD.  They didn't do a fraction of the work that Wilco's team did.  Wilco's box set is NOTHING BUT RARITIES.  It is amazing.  Bruce's songs and guitar playing and voice are also amazing, but his team has put together a box set that is not worth the support of fans who deserve more.","1921":"Slow tunes overall ok not wonderful","1922":"This being an import I am assuming it's either going to be the German or the French 12\". Either way the tracks are all identical to the U.S. release. There is nothing worth getting on this 12\" vinyl you can't get on the original album unless you are a remix freak. Trust me. The remix (or dance version) isn't worth it. You get three tracks:\n\n- Owner Of A Lonely Heart (Special \"Red & Blue\" Remix Dance Version)\n\nThis is considered a very rare track, but it's a mess. It's has a strong vibe on it similar to Dazz Band's Let it Whip along with various pacing breaks, sample clips (including a popular Art of Noise voice sample), and other distractions put in between normal spots of the song. It's an irritating club mix that runs a little over seven minutes.\n\n- Owner Of A Lonely Heart (Edited Version)\n\nJust a single mix of the album version. It's about a minute shorter than the album version and feels a bit stunted because of it. Although I admit it does hit all the important marks, but you miss some cool instrumentation.\n\n- Our Song\n\nThis is the exact same version as what's found on the 90125 album.\n\nIf you are a major Yes fan and need all the mixes (including the bad ones) then I suppose you will find value in this 12\". Everybody else just pass it up.","1923":"Great song!!","1924":"Mysterious Sound !!!!! I Want MORE!!!","1925":"A great collection of Spanish and Cuban guitar!","1926":"People, if Your going to pick up Skip Bafferty, then You might as well get this Group also. \"Eden's Children\" on Stateside Records was famous in the South Land of California, and yes, I know that they were two years before Skip, but I just think that both styles fit in nicely! Heard this group from KMET, KLOS and KWST ( K-West). Well, here are MY favorite Songs, \"Knocked Out\", \"Bad Habit\", \"If She's Right\", \"Spirit Call\", \"Sure Looks Real\", \"Toasted\", \"Wings\", \"Out Where The Light\", \"Things Gone Wrong\", \"Awakening\", \"Call it Design\" and \"Come When I Call\". Both Groups Are Awesome! OK!, another One? OK! \"The Plastic Cloud\" on Allied Records, and the songs are, \"Face Behind The Sun\", \"Shadows Of Your Mind\", \"Dainty General Rides\", \"Civilization Machine\" and \"You Don't Care\"! One More? OK!, \"Cosmic Dealer\" on Negram Records! The Killer Songs are, \"Head In The Clouds\", \"Daybreak\", \"Find Your Way\", \"Child Of The Golden Sun\", \"I Had A Friend\" and \"The Scene\"! Might as well throw in the \"SINGLE ONLY\" of \"Cosmic Michael\" on Radioactive  ( Bliss ) Records with \"Cosmic Michael Theme\" b\/w \"Now That I Found It\"! Thanks!!!","1927":"Awesome Song!!!","1928":"I bought it because I like the One Winged Angel song off of both Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts, but this has got to be the weirdest remix I've ever heard. I wouldn't suggest it at all.","1929":"A homage is a tribute a fan pays to a certain person or thing in respects to the original work without profiteering from the work. It is free. It is available to all. And it is easily accessible. Even Voices of the Lifestream is free. This is not free. This is a fallacy. It should be reported to Square-Enix and to Uematsu for Copyright infringment.\n\nBeyond that, lets look at this from a Musical Critic's perspective:\n\nIt doesn't even seem like it took these guys longer than a day to make this. All the songs' raps sound exactly the same. Just listen to the demo. They didn't even remix the background songs they used to rap over. It's laughable really. It's like a few guys in their basement using a re-mixing program to produce, well, crap.\n\nThis is isn't rapping. It's crapping. And I am not saying that to get on anyone's nerves. It's true. It's easily ascertainable. \"Oh man, so many tribute albums, this is the best one!\" No. It's not. Not even for the Rap genre. But what bothers me the most is that the people who made this had the audacity to put up for sale on Amazon. It's not worth 9 dollars. No tribute is. No homage is. Why? Because the true fan doesn't wish to see a profit from their fandom. They do it as fans.\n\nAnd these fans aren't good rappers. And I know good rap. I enjoy rap. So Final Fantasy\/Rap lovers, understand I am judging this based on my opinion of rap. This is just... bad. Hell, Will Smith can make better raps than this.\n\nYou want a true homage from great fan-artists? Just Youtube it. You don't have to pay for it. And you don't have subject yourself to this garbage.","1930":"We sing this song during Praise and Worship at our church and since my voice is low, I get to lead it.  www.forgivenchurch.tv","1931":"Great christmas song","1932":"Love this music!

I plan to use it during our Superhero Training Party to get everyone in the mood to be superheroes!","1938":"Excellent","1939":"The song itself is good but it's missing 11 seconds worth in the middle and no, it's not supposed to be like that.  I found it on I tunes the exact same way.","1940":"I have been a fan of Yuki Kajiura ever since I was able to buy a copy of the first Fiction album. This is some very enjoyable music.","1941":"There is no introduction and it is melody-heavy. Not an accompaniment track- it is an instrumental version of the hymn. Wish I'd known that before I paid for it.","1942":"What more can be said?","1943":"the quality of this song was awful and a waste of money. The YouTube version is so much b...ette. Bad buy on my part","1944":"Whether you are new to this extremely eccentric and eclectic British group from the late '60's, or a dedicated fan, you'll have hours of laughs and amazement in store. Featuring future Monty Python musical genius Neil Innes and national treasure Vivian Stanshall.","1945":"Beautifully done and easy to use.  It's soothing to just sit and listen even if you don't use it as an accompaniment track.","1946":"I made a mistake buying this as I thought I was getting the one where she sings the songs, however, the music is very pretty and I find it relaxing to listen to.","1947":"I had the great opportunity to remaster and restore by removing as much noise as possible using high-end equipment.\nI wish I could provide you with some samples of before and after. This collection is great!","1948":"This a very special collection. It is a musical form of genealogy. I never met my grand or great grand parents who lived and died in Puerto Rico. But I am sure they knew and heard this music. This music is a time machine back to a time of  a young and hopeful Borinquen.","1949":"Have always loved her music .As she sings you are brought into a presence of God that we all  so desperately desire ,it leaves you wanting more of Him.\nI'm very happy and thankful for my purchase. SC\n\nIT was just what I needed and wanted.","1950":"I purchased and downloaded this song for a friends ring tone, he loved it, but it goes back a little too far for my tastes.","1951":"soothing","1952":"Two different recordings play on top of each other, thus making my purchase useless.","1953":"This unfortunately did not download well - the narrator speaks 'over' himself.  Love to know if there is a way to fix it.","1954":"The song is really a great song, but the audio sucks. There is 'Columbia Country Classics: The Golden Age' with Gene Autry's 'You Are My Sunshine' - that is sooo much better","1955":"I have purchased this song from Amazon twice (once the entire album)  The rest of the album is fine, but this song SKIPS and is just a hot mess.  I am really SAD! because Nick Thurmond has done my FAVORITE rendition to date of this song.  I want it right, and I want it on my amazon player.  :(","1956":"And it repeats over and over and over again. 9 minutes worth.","1957":"Not the quality of Jeffrey White material I remember when I was in New York back in the eighties.  That group was stellar.  This cd:fair","1958":"I was so distracted by the atrocious sound recording that I couldn't focus on the hypnotist voice.  Do not buy this product unless you like wasting money (:","1959":"awful, garbage recording! background noise distractions and over-dubbed voices sound like accidental double recording. Amateur hour here","1960":"If you love the outdoors and everything our Creator has blessed us with. Then you will love this music. I've been listening to the ole duck fever cd for years. My groomsmen and I even walked out to THE LIFE at my wedding. Great stuff you won't regret buying this.","1961":"Unlistenable due to poor recording, speaker's accent, and overlapping phrases.  I know it's cheap, but it's not even worth the $.89.","1962":"This MP3 track is defective--volume is so low it is inaudible.","1963":"I think both Debbie and tiffany are great ladies of the 80s and this song is fun and catchey just like a pop\/dance song should be. Tiffany's new country album is amazing as well. Not to mention they both have powerful voices!!","1964":"Crappy.  Really crappy.  This is the cherry on top of the crap sundae that is the SyFy Channel's original movie, Mega Python vs Gatoroid.  Former teen queen Debbie Gibson asks us to \"shed our skin for [her]\" and the very thought of that makes you want to hurl, not unlike the special effect pythons in the movie regurgitate partially digested limbs from their hapless victims.  The song is featured several times in the movie including a confusing montage of time passing while the 'roided up gators breed in the everglades.  A song from the other former 80s teen sensation, Tiffany, who also \"stars\" in the movie is also featured, however does not seem to be available for purchase.  Thank god for small favors.","1965":"The background music and sounds during the hypnosis session are pretty darned eerie. It honestly felt like I was listening to the soundtrack of a horror movie and a paranormal spirit was about to take over my soul. There were times when he's bumping the microphone or I could hear background noises. His voice wasn't assuring and words weren't what I feel I needed, \"Imagine what you would be doing if you were confident.\" Really, I expected more than that.","1966":"I could hear him breathing in the microphone and he had terrible English.  When I want to relax, I don't want to have to concentrate on filtering out an accent.","1967":"This song is really \"River Flows in You\" by Yiruma with an overlay that is downright atrocious. Yiruma on the other hand is a terrific pianist that I would recommend to any who enjoy quality music. If you got here tracking down \"bella's lullaby\" this is not from the movie. Go get the real soundtrack, if on the other hand, you are looking for a beautiful solo piano piece, go check out River Flows in You on Youtube or Itunes (amazon doesn't have it at this time.)","1968":"The narrator has a very relaxing voice and the music overlay is pleasant. That's all the good I can say about this track. There are multiple narrated audio tracks overlayed over each other. At some points the narrator talks over himself. At other times there is noise in the room such as objects dropping on a desk, or other noises in the room. Very distracting.","1969":"I loved this song from 1990 called You & Me by Jamm and had been looking for it to purchase or download since it's out of print and thought I had hit the jackpot when I found it here on Amazon for download. However I was disappointed after I downloaded it and realized it didn't sound as I remembered it then after closer review, It occurred to me that the RPM has been increased to be more appropriate for \"stepping\" (a form of line dancing). So if you don't mind the increase in speed, help yourself. As for me the hunt continues for this unsung Hit from 1990. By the way smooth jazz saxophonist George Howard covered it on his \"Personal\" album","1970":"I'm not usually one to listen to this type of music, but I've been lucky enough to get to know Matt (the genius behind the music) and to see him perform. He truly has a gift and the songs he composes are heartfelt and genuine. Mutual friends and acquaintances had always raved about how talented he is, and when I got a chance to hear his music myself I was captivated and bought a copy of his CD immediately. I do have a few favorite tracks, but I would be lying if I said there were any that are less than brilliant. You can preview the tracks and see for yourself, but I highly encourage everyone to support him and buy a copy. You won't be disappointed!","1971":"The audio doesn't play at all and I like that song. Please fix the audio","1972":"I like to pretend Grendel never made this album. Try synthetic generation.","1973":"Wow.  I can't recall ever being so shocked and dismayed by a once-great act dropping such a stink bomb of this magnitude.  By stripping out the distortion on the vocals, Grendel reveals not only a puny, strangulated, wanna-be tough\/emo voice, but also lyrics that are so childish and silly, I was embarrassed to be listening.  Even worse, the songs consist of nothing but choruses- the same three lines repeated over and over, and then the choruses themselves are repeated over and over.  In other words, each song has about three lines, total, each of which is repeated three times within a chorus, and the chorus is repeated about six times within the song...and lines themselves are utterly cheesy and stupid.\n\nFurthermore, this idiot has done what so many other Goth\/Industrial losers have-- given his girlfriend way too much space on the album-- her monotone \"robo-girl\" interjections are particularly annoying.\n\nI suspected that Grendel's last album, Harsh Generation, was a little too cheesy and commercialized, but I chose to ignore those aspects.  Unfortunately, every silly and ridiculous aspect of Harsh Generation has only been enhanced and expanded upon with this new single.  This release is just pure garbage that is a disgrace to the genre.\n\nCheck out Aesthetic Perfection's new one, A Violent Emotion, for an example of how harsh electro\/ebm\/industrial can continue to evolve and stay vital, and stay away from this stinking cheese pile by Grendel.","1974":"underwhelming ; Its not something I would feel would keep a houseparty going. though I should note when I went looking for it today to give it another shot  it was nixed from my Amazon library after upgrading to Windows 10 so backup your music and keep an eye on situations like that.","1975":"Terribly disappointing remix of one of the greatest progressive rock bands of all time.  Stick with their original recordings.","1976":"Absolute junk... One of the premier progressive groups of all time destroyed with some of the worst remixing imaginable.","1977":"What a way to destroy good music! I can't believe that ELP would let this go out. Terrible! All ELP fans would hate this, as I do.","1978":"This version is awful.  After listening the latest album by Bersuit (without him) and this version of what it was a great song before he destroyed it, it is clear that Cordera should retire.","1979":"Now this is jazz!\n\nThis album has great tracks by Dave Brubeck, including the infamous 'Take Five.'  I highly recommend this album if you're a fan of his or if you just enjoy jazz.","1980":"SPEND THE MONEY AND DOWNLOAD YOUR FAVORITES ON I-TUNES.  THAT WAY YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT AND NOT SOME FILLERS","1981":"Everyone knows about Dave Brubeck's Girl from Ipanema and Take Fiver, but he was more than that. His sound was bluesy, intoxicating and reflective of his genius.","1982":"While the intent was clearly aimed at assisting people with self hypnosis, the production is so poorly done the track is distracting and confusing, There are two narrated audio tracks where the narrator talks overtop of himself. The microphone was poorly setup and speech \"puffs\" or breath are clearly audible - almost as of he is blowing on the microphone.","1983":"i feel in love with this song right away and bought it here on amazon cause its cheaper here than itunes!","1984":"Sing this to my wife (of 51 years) every night before bed. She says I sound like Perry Como. (ha ha)!","1985":"Yes, I love house music...at my age; because I love music (all kinds) period. And house (music) helps me work harder & get into my daily workouts without even paying attention to the time.","1986":"I loved the music on this CD and I was sure my sister would too.  Her favorites are different from mine, but she enjoys the whole set.","1987":"all are great","1988":"Terribly disappointing remix of one of the greatest progressive rock bands of all time.  Stick with their original recordings.","1989":"What a bunch of garbage! Way to turn great music into Disco! I can't believe ELP would let this go out.","1990":"Road Ratt were another unfairly overlooked melodic rock band from the early 1990's. Much like Treat, Damned Nation and Nasty Idols, these guys never achieved any fame outside their native land, but that's not saying they shouldn't have.\n\nRoad Ratt's sound is kin to what the Electric Boys were doing at the time. Some people call this funk rock, but there really aren't too many traces of funk on this record in my own opinion. The production is typical Swedish, with over-the-top sounds and choruses, and the songs are just as catchy as ever. How the Swedes continue to pump out such quality hard rock, even till this day, is far beyond me. While I wouldn't call this essential, or even five-star, it does have some really cool melodic rock songs. I liked \"Use The Lighter,\" \"Ragman City,\" \"Beggars Day\" and \"Turn Me On;\" the rest was decent, but there was also some filler that crept in as well.\n\nI think every melodic rock fan should check this record out. Buying the actualy cd is ridiculous due to limited supply they made, but downloading it is like nine dollars. I would definitely go that route fellow rockers, and everyone check this out quick!","1991":"Good digital reproduction.","1992":"I'm a sucker for slow music with beautiful words, and this is one of those songs.  Music is solace to our souls, and makes our lives a little bit easier....well, this kind of music anyway.","1993":"If you enjoy the old, hit standards and a great voice, this is for you.  I would easily recommend it.","1994":"The Best!\nIf you like Black Sabbath, Steppenwolf, or Jimi Hendrix and Quentin Tarantino soundtracks this is probably what you've looking for--for so long....","1995":"The Spider Hole is one of those bands that defy categorization, as only the best do.  If nothing else, its eccentric rock the sort of rock with impeccable style, that wears a fedora, bursts unexpectedly through the haze of a smoky club and sways its hips with a swinging, boozy groove, sometimes foul-mouthed but always charming.  It both compliments and intrudes upon your melancholy thoughts with gratifying irreverence.\n\nThe lyrics can be absurd and surreal--but even at their extremes, they are too poetic to be entirely gratuitous.  They are dream-like, driving in pace along with the music, and you could just enjoy the sound of them and the clever turns of phrase, if you like.  But if you really listen you might get the sense that youve fallen down a rabbit hole of some punkish film noir series, with mysterious characters and strange story-telling.  The lead singers voice is both wild and precise, with such a daring stylistic range that you nearly imagine it to be more than one person.\n\nFor a debut album this is an incredible offering -- every song is solid and the album is tight in production and coherent in tone.  Excellent guitar, bass, drums along with whimsical piano riffs, the occasional horn, and various effects that all add to the mood at just the right times.  It would be impossible to pick one favorite or standout among so many strong tracks.  Not a single weak song to be skipped.  In fact, its still, many years after its initial release, one of my all-time favorite albums to play all the way through.  Its darkly theatrical and a lot of fun to move to.\n\nTo sum up... Holy sh** this band is awesome!  Buy this album and you will have a hidden gem of musical mischief with which to while away the dull hours and impress your friends with!  The Spider Hole stands alone -- there is no other band quite like them.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n(Its also worth the effort to track down the band and give them some love and cash to snag a copy of their newest album Royal Spend, which is just as great but unavailable on Amazon as of this writing.)","1996":"This song reminds me of Winter Sonata whenever I hear it. It's a beautiful composition.","1997":"A very old performance with poor recording quality .  Buy a newer version especially of Act II which has some wonderful segments.  Those great segments just don't shine in this recording.","1998":"Cheap imitators","1999":"What a rip off! I was in the gym and didn't expect to download 50 pub-singer cover versions of once great songs.... I want my money back.","2000":"Cheap stuff","2001":"yep got tricked again thought it was original music but it's not and to be honest it sucks don't waste your time","2002":"Granted, I was shopping online for music at 2 in the morning, however, I really didn't think this was covers of the original songs.\n\nFor the price and the number of fantastic songs, I could have really enjoyed cover songs, however, the singing was horrible. I understand that no one can \"replace\" Tina Turner, but that was painful. The singers failed to stay in the range they are able to sing.","2003":"I ordered the two One Hit Wonders together.  Big Mistake. The songs were sung by unknowns, not the original arists.  I should have looked more closely at whatbI was ordering.","2004":"I bought it using my phone thinking I was getting the original songs by the original artists. Nope! It's Graham Blvd. (whoever they are) doing the songs. Boo.","2005":"NOTE: IF YOU LIKE BAD REMAKES OF THE ORIGINAL HITS THIS IS FOR YOU...I MADE THE MISTAKE OF SEEING THE SONGS THAT ARE ON THIS AND VOL. 2 AND THINKING THES ARE GREAT SONGS BUT ONLY HAD TO HEAR THE FIRST SONG \"CARS\" TO REALIZE IT WAS NOT GARY NEMAN SINGING IT...YOUR DRUNK BUDDY AT THE LOCAL BAR COULD DO BETTER AT THE MIC ...THESE ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS SINGING...","2006":"Unfortunately this CD listed here is not an original CD. It is a copy from an LP to a CD and the quality is pretty poor. And 2 other Studio Recordings listed here in Amazon are also copies. So if you see this CD listed here even if the seller states it as brand new don't believe it because the idea is to deceive you into believing you have an original CD in your hands which is not. You can also buy it and see for yourself and then return it for a full refund. I wish one day the will edit her 3 great albums on an original CD.","2007":"love the song love the band. different sound. definitely a dance tune. makes you want to jam. one of their better songs","2008":"Alastair McDonald is at his best here.  He narrates briefly before each song, putting the song into its proper historical context.  For any student of Scottish history, or lover of Scottish music, this is a must-have.","2009":"Not the real Barry White the man album.\nI'm very disappointed.","2010":"Smoother than silk, enjoyable, memorable, fun","2011":"All that I can say is that is MP3 helps you to get CLEAR on what you need to do.","2012":"After the violent incident that took place @ Red Rocks @ a Schoolboy Q concert, one must wonder what kind of violent gorillas are fans of this clown's music. Music glorifying delinquency and breeding violence. Whatever happened to non violent\/criminal rap acts like Common or De La Soul??Give me a Beach Boys concert any day over this overrated crap~! At least their concerts don't attract this punk-a$$ element that would not be so brave if they weren't packin heat!","2013":"The song failed (successively) to download; however, I still paid the 99 cents.  Things don't work as well since YAHOO introduced the \"Cloud\".\n\nI will probably investigate itunes for my future downloads.","2014":"Listen to this song back before 1966 and didn't know that Carl Belew wrote it and cut a copy of it too . Have always love the song. as well as Speak To Me","2015":"When this song 1st came out in the 80's it was a hit, and it still is. But the remixed version is Whack, Whack, Whack!!!!. I was disappointed that the only way I could get the original version was to buy the whole album. Not good.","2016":"I'm an 80's child and I always liked George Michael.","2017":"love the song","2018":"George Michael is one of those naturally talented singers and performers and regardless of who you are attracted to you can't deny his charisma with this song or the music video. He is a great performer and this is just a fun enjoyable song!","2019":"This is a BAD track! It leaves out a line and screws the singer up horribly! I am going to ask for my $ back!!!","2020":"Love this song and so does my four month old","2021":"This might have been fine, except a whole sentence of the accompaniment was missing, leaving a critical hole in the song.  We bought a replacement from Christian Book Distributors.","2022":"this is the second track I bought that is missing the same line! Ultimate tracks is also missing the same line","2023":"I was not pleased with this soundtrack because it seems as though the music was playing at a faster speed than the original song.  Maybe I just need to listen to the original song again as I am used to singing the song via keyboard at church.; but even so, it still seemed like it was too fast.  Perhaps ther was a mistake in the downloading process.","2024":"I wish I would have read the reviews, because IT IS MISSING A LINE!  I'm so disappointed! ;(  It jumps from 'the fatherless the find there rest...\" line into the chorus and totally skips \"the sick are healed and the dead are raised...\"  VERY DISAPPOINTING download... and no way for refund. :(\nI hope you're reading the reviews first (unlike me)... Hope this stops someone else from making my mistake!!!","2025":"I only heard this song once on Pandora and was like, I need to get this! And I did. No disappointments.","2026":"Good Music","2027":"This is most definitely one of the most terrible things ever to be put upon this earth. It is so bad that they must have been trying to make it this bad.","2028":"I definitely did not like this track. We tried practicing it before singing it at church and the music skipped a line in the song. It's not a good instrumental version of your great name. I lvoet his song but this version is bad.","2029":"When I bought the mp3 download, I had not heard the original. I like the Glee version better by far.","2030":"German Gothic music PERFEKT","2031":"In their Church EP, Adam Levy and Amber Rubarth have crafted touching, melodic and hauntingly beautiful music. The two artists work well together and the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts. These are great acoustic sounds.","2032":"Good album to relax to and the music selection is pretty good.","2033":"great","2034":"An imposing trio of smooth jazz.","2035":"Great stuff!","2036":"Good pagan music","2037":"Bought the wrong song. Misled buckshot mix. Dont buy this not even for a dollar. The stupid rating system makes me keep writing","2038":"Still love it--easy listening, old school. Good songwriting from 1979. Romantic types will love it no matter the age.","2039":"Purchased by mistake, thought I was getting Gregory Isaacs night nurse album","2040":"In the heyday of the so-called \"Garage Bands\" one emerged from Lansing, Michigan to make a minor dent on the Billboard Pop Hot 100 in March 1967 with a surprisingly good rendition of the Bo Diddley-penned (in 1956) Who Do You Love? Led by vocalist Stormy Rice, the other members were harpist\/keyboardist \"Boogie\" Bob Baldori, guitarist Jeff Baldori, bassist Ron English and drummer Bee Metros, their first time on record was 1965's Black Crow Blues b\/w Morning Dew as TTP-156 which quickly went nowhere.\n\nLate in 1966 they got Dunhill\/ABC sufficiently interested to release Who Do You Love? b\/w Hey Girl as Dunhill\/ABC 4052 and by the following March they had made their one minor mark on U.S. Pop single history. However, when the follow-up Duncan And Brady b\/w Love Words bombed as Dunhill\/ABC 4088 later in 1967 they were dropped. Hits collectors can find a decent copy of their lone charting side in the CD Michigan Nuggets but I have never run across the B-side in any such compilation, so at the moment completist collectors will have to settle for a good vinyl source such the 45-rpm covered here.\n\nDespite their lack of commercial success, the talents displayed by the band were recognized by no less than two R&R legends (and Hall of Fame inductees) Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley and starting in 1967 they often appeared as the back-up band for both artists (in fact, Berry's 1970 album Back Home features their contributions). Sometime in 1968 Rice embarked upon a solo career with his replacement being multiple instrumentalist Zocko Groendahl.\n\nIn 1970 they released the album \"Basic Rock\" at Bob Baldori's Spirit Records containing: A1. Who Do You Love?; A2. Two Way Wishin'; A3. Let's Not Use Each Other; A4. Bye Bye Johnny; A5. San Francisco Bay Blues; A6. Hear The Music; B1. You're My Angel; B2. Back For More; B3. Vandegraff's Blues; B4. Truckin'; B5. Wish You Would. From the LP emerged the 1970 singles Vandergraf's Blues (or I Get A Charge Out Of You) b\/w Vandergraf's Blahs as Spirit 0007 and Back For More b\/w the non-LP side Super Ball - label number not clear. Two years later they compiled their second album, \"Live At Lizard's\" - recorded at Lizard's in East Lansing - containing: A1. Shake The Boogie (3:38); A2. Stormy Monday (4:38); A3. Berry Medley (6:42); A4. Mojo (9:14); B1. Dust My Blues (3:44); B2. I Wanna Boogie (9:10); B3. Hot Tamales (1:46); B4. Comin' Round The Mountain (1:39); B5. Bye Bye Boogie (10:00).\n\nA CD collection of their music recorded from 1965 to 1975 has been produced by Bob Baldori titled Ride, Ride, Ride containing: 1. Super Ball (3.16); 2. Ride Ride Ride (3.06); 3. Black Crow Blues (1.41); 4. Love Words (2.47); 5. Bring It With You When You Come (1.57); 6. Morning Dew (2.45); 7. Chuck's Chunk (2.17); 8. Who Do You Love? (2.02); 9. Feelin' Good (3.01); 10. Can't Get Stuff (3.28); 11. Hootchie Cootchie Man Is Back (2.44); 12. Back for More (2.45); 13. Duncan And Brady (2.24); Vandegraf's Blues (2.54); 15. Two Way Wishin' (2.24); 16. Hyper-Inflation Boogie (1.57). Unfortunately, that does not appear to be available through Amazon.com.","2041":"New and interesting.  Love the quality of her voice though the band it's self could use a little more oractice.  She's fantastic though","2042":"Love this Song","2043":"This song is a classic example of how The Pretty Reckless is a band that expresses their thoughts in very direct ways, in your face...so to speak.  Not for little kids, \"Parental Guidance Suggested\".","2044":"I stumbled across this song when exploring an author's \"playlists\" for two of her books... Jaime McGuire has written Beautiful Disaster and has followed it up with Walking Disaster. To accompany these books, she has assembled two playlists... awesome attempt to add mood by use of sound for her written stories. Hymn for the Missing kicks off the playlist for Walking Disaster! Find this playlist here: [...]  The playlist for Beautiful Disaster is here: [...]","2045":"love red","2046":"the best song to listen to when you are sad or just want the world to leave you alone.  it's it's just an amazing song","2047":"CD was delivered with a cracked case","2048":"It makes me cry","2049":"This CD is absolutely amazing! The voice, the drums, the guitar, the key board..... I can't begin to say how great every song is. My personal favorite is Diver, the theme from Naruto Shippuden. Much to my enjoyment they are a very entertaining band just like Asian Kung Fu Generation and The Massmissile. I highly suggest this to fans of Jrock or Jpop. You will not be disappointed at all.","2050":"Not what I expected","2051":"Sure, there is a recognizable theme from the second movement of the Pathetique, and it explains another reviewer's reaction: \"who ripped this off Beethoven?\"\n\nIn fact, that's the proper way to describe this make-believe 10th. Cooper took themes (mostly incomplete themes) belonging Beethoven, and he wrote a piece that's not in any recognizable Beethoven style. He wrote it in the style of Schumann, Mendelssohn and, mildly in places of counterpoint, Brahms.\n\nIt contains more melodies crammed together than Beethoven incorporates in his symphonies. The ketches used in this symphony were written during different times in Beethoven's life and they may well have been intended for uses other than a 10th symphony. They were pasted together with crazy glue.\n\nCooper's Symphony #10 is no more than a piece of conversation.\n\nI doubt you'll want to listen to it more than 2 or 3 times, out of curiosity for cooper's understanding of Beethoven. Cooper may be a scholar who has studied how Beethoven wrote music. He may cognitively understand Beethoven's method of composition, but Beethoven has not penetrated his creative heart.","2052":"Songwriters they aren't.  Except for \"Storm Comin' \" every song is the same low-key drone with uninspired mumbled lyrics. Even \"Storm Comin' \" gets old fast since it is so repetitious.  A good song is more than a few good lines repeated ad nauseum.\n\nI should have learned my lesson with \"Live at the Mauch Chunk Opera House\". Of the five songs I like on that CD, four are covers.  Songs written by the Jennys were forgettable.","2053":"Despite a nice version of Bright Morning Star this CD was a huge disappointment.  The exquisite harmonies that are the magic of The Wailin Jenneys are absent from many of the selections.  The music is more orchestrated and far less traditional and\/or acoustic.  Sadly this is what happens to so many acoustic and traditional musicians.  They try to appeal to a pop audience and forget who they are and what makes them unique & special.","2054":"My first listen...LOVE THESE GALS! MUSIC AND VOICES....AND SPUNK!","2055":"Just gorgeous. The perfect balance of bluegrass  and folk.","2056":"This is the song exactly as it appears in series 5 and 6.  GERONIMO!","2057":"my fault.

I can't wait for the next one","2064":"After reading all the glamourous reviews on this album I bought it.  Terrible idea!!  I am a big fan of the Hans Zimmer and James Horner pieces but this album does NOT do their scores justice at all!!  I already have some songs from the movie originals and the ones on this album are TERRIBLE!!!! Hans Zimmer has done a wonderful job composing these songs but these songs are not movie originals and they aren't as \"full\" as the originals and the voices are not the same singers.\nI've learned my lesson...next time I will do more research. I am extremely disappointed with this purchase! :'(","2065":"Songs great but wasted my $ since I can't play it on my pc. Not really happy about that .... bummmmmer","2066":"THIS IS STILEN THESE PEOPLE HAVE NOT GOTTEN PERMISSION TO RECORD THIS SONG NOR ARE THEY PAYING ROYALTIES. AMAZON IS SELLING ILLEGAL JUNK.","2067":"I haven't stopped listening to it since I downloaded it.  \"Barricades\" is so freakin' catchy, but they are all great!!!! If you like Band of Horses, The National or Radiohead you'll love this album.","2068":"Of the many shelved Death Row-associated projects, this one represents probably the most regrettable what-if, how-much-of-a-classic-it-would-have-been-had-it-been-released-on-time, situation,\n\nRap groups tend to behave a bit like radioactive nuclei, i.e., they have a decay half-life. It's quite short and it's especially brief when they are put together sort of randomly and loosely as a promotion vehicle for their members, which was the case with the LBC Crew. This album was recorded around 1995, but it had to wait for Dogg Food to come out first, as Daz and Kurupt had already been introduced on previous Death Row releases and it was their turn to put out an album. But Dogg Food was delayed for legal reasons and only came out in late 1995, just when 2Pac came in and instantly became the massive star around which everything in the label gravitated. Meanwhile there were issues with how exactly the album was to be released. Bottom line, they were given enough time to fall out with each other, and they duly did it, right around the time when the label itself began falling apart too.\n\nAnd the album never came out, which is real shame.\n\nThere are a couple forgettable tracks, but overall this is at least on the same level as Dogg Food, and it should have ranked right there with it and other Death Row releases in the pantheon of G-Funk classics. Unfortunately, at this point in time it's not really possible to appreciate how good the album is as after it got shelved, several of the tracks were reused for other projects and much of the rest leaked on the internet. So few people will be hearing all of it for the first time. And that's also a shame because the tracks that came out on other projects around 1997 ended up lost in the shuffle of the Death Row collapse -- for example, Out The Moon was on the Gridlock'd soundtrack, which went gold, but it nevertheless remains a relatively obscure track because no video was ever made for it and it was never given any serious promotion, Really sad.\n\nAnyway, if you have never heard any of these tracks before, consider yourself lucky and listen to it as a new album from start to finish, you will not be disappointed.","2069":"If you're down with sounds from the DEATH ROW era when Pac, Dre Snoop, Dogg Pound and\nothers were deeply on the map. You would enjoy this album, cauz this was supposed to\ncome out around 1996 and it was never released. You can hear Tray Dee from The Eassidaz\nwas part of the group as well as lil' C style. For all true West Coast fans. Enjoy.","2070":"Good music.","2071":"If you just discovered Tim Janis...this CD is perfect for you. However, if you are a fan of TJ, this CD is a rip-off. Only two songs on the album are new...(1) Every Soft Glow \/ and number (6) Under the Eves of Heaven.","2072":"Don't recall ordering this product.","2073":"one worthwhile tune","2074":"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/F-Y-I-Love-You\/dp\/B0013WPETQ\n\nThis one is better.","2075":"Great song to get the party started, or end the party with.","2076":"Love it","2077":"I was ecstatic to find this soundtrack after doing a google search for the instrumental theme song. I ordered a copy for both my sister and myself who have been fans of the show since it first aired when we were children. The CD is high sound quality and the artwork is great. We had a wonderful, sentimental time listening to all the tracks and remembering the episodes they belong to. It has a great nostalgic feel that really brings back a lot of the emotion of the show. I would definitely recommend this soundtrack to anyone who was a fan of The Young Riders. I am very pleased with this purchase.","2078":"I was waiting for some of the moody, lonely music that was heard on Rat Patrol but haven't found it yet. It certainly isn't on this CD","2079":"This CD contains several decent versions of the \"The Rat Patrol\" TV show theme (\"The Rat Patrol Main Title,\" \"The Rat Patrol End Credits,\" and \"Theme From The Rat Patrol\"), but is sorely lacking in all the other major and memorable secondary themes and music.  Amazing, considering there are 42 additional bits of music, the shortest at 49 seconds and the longest at more than 5 minutes, most all of them unrecognizable to fans of this classic late-'60's TV show, including myself -- and I've got both seasons of the show on DVD.\n\nThe CD is nicely packaged, with the insert booklet fronting a great photo of the show's four main cast members, and contains some interesting text about the making of the show and Dominic Frontiere's remarks on creating the soundtrack.  As with any re-recorded compilation of soundtrack music from a television show performed by  musicians other than the originals (in this case the Graunke Symphony Orchestra, although per the CD's text notes, supposedly conducted by Frontiere), the main theme pieces I mentioned above sound just a tad different from the music on the TV episodes.\n\nOverall, a disappointment, due to the inexplicable omission of some memorable secondary themes and music from the show.  I'm glad I got a used copy, and didn't pay too much  for this item.","2080":"This is an excellent quality CD with the original theme and background music I remember from the 'Rat Patrol' series.  It's quite similar to the 3 CD set of Dominic Frontiere's music from 'The Outer Limits', and I hope there will soon be a release of his original scores from '12 O'Clock High'.","2081":"I gave it four out of five stars not because it isn't good, but because I was hoping Verishuvi & Please, Please, Please were on 2010.  Since purchasing I figured out they are on 2011 and have ordered it.  In context, Doki Doki Morning seems out of place with the rest of the Album, but I'm one of those that wouldn't have ever purchased this if it hadn't been for Babymetal.\n\nFor those that want to know what you get before you buy:\n\nTracklist\n\n  FLY AWAY\n  Hello!

It has a remix of a Backstreet boys song that I couldn't find anywhere","2085":"This recording is clearly amateur and the poor quality of the performance makes it difficult to listen to.  There's a blatant mistake at 2:59, as well as numerous iffy parts overall, and there's absolutely no artistic effort made here.  Essentially it sounds like a piano student muddling along to a metronome.  I would stick to a real recording by Horowitz or Gould.","2086":"Beautiful music!!!","2087":"Nicely done, in my opinion not nearly long enough! This is a great album. TSO is what ROCK OPERA is all about.  You have to like rock & roll to appreciate this album. This album gives you a nice alternative from their traditionally seasonal music. TSO is a great band. after listening to them for over 15 years. We finally went to a concert and were overwhelmingly entertained.","2088":"Alotta breaks on this album","2089":"Great vintage music love it","2090":"Gareth Davis and Rutger Zuydervelt have first met around 2009, when the duo recorded their first piece, Soundlines. After the limited edition EP was self-released by Machinefabriek, the duo didn't waste any time, and put out another 3 CDr, titled Ghost Lanes [which later got picked up by Dekorder with an additional track]. A year later, Davis and Zuydervelt got together again, this time for an album for Home Normal, titled Drape. And now the two appear on Sonic Pieces, with a two-part, Grower. Those familiar with Davis, can instantly imagine the brooding darkness this clarinetist can contribute to Zuydervelt's shuffling treatments. At times barely audible, woodwind breathes over low rumbling drones, creating a stilled atmosphere where even a pin drop gets picked up by the mic. The tender poise of each wave is slowly cultivated through a unique language among the two musicians, allowing the sound to unfold on its own, in environment free of grievance.  Focusing on the music, or just letting it seep, is something a mind must decide on its own. In either case, the meditative piece will reward those with patience. No wonder Grower was featured on Headphone Commute's Best of 2011, Music For Sonic Installations In the Cavern Of Your Skull. Be sure to also check out my review of Gareth Davis & Frances-Marie Uitti Gramercy, out on Miasmah. I'm sure we'll hear from the two again...","2091":"I stumbled onto this piece of improvisational jazz by accident.  Approximately 10 minutes in length and without any recognizable melody,  the piano, bass and percussion skillfully interact with each other in a  way that makes one wonder how it will end.  My reaction: wow!  A great night mood mix.","2092":"Fulfilled my expectations.","2093":"This is not an original CD. The quality is horrible. Also, some songs are not complete.","2094":"This is not an original CD or new release by Marcel Khalife. I was very surprised to see that Amazon sells home made copied CDs....It is not worth more than $5 and Amazon is charging about $20. The recording quality isn't that great either.","2095":"Casey's release after his run on American Idol was so amazing that it remains one of my favorite albums when I want an uplifting fun listen. This one, by comparison is nothing but depressing. I wouldn't even know it was the same guy. Buyer beware.","2096":"Thought this might be fun to listen to on a road trip so that i had something different to listen to - uh boring - wasted download and cost - although cheap - I don't advise this one.","2097":"Nice example of steel band music.","2098":"Always been a favorite song","2099":"I really tried to be open while listening to this album, but it saddens me to say the least. I used to watch these guys play with Skif Dank all the time in a downtown local pub, and that's when they rocked. The horn parts are few, and this new synth stuff they're putting in there really make them sound like a different band.\n\nI understand bands have to switch their style up, but they are hardly anything like The Supervillains. I don't know what happened to the actual band, but this is nothing like the last album.\n\nSome people will be able to relate when I say that this album makes me feel dirty, and depressed. If thats your style, and something you think you'd enjoy then by all means definitely get this album. If you were expecting a Supervillains album, then look for a new band, or I guess you could listen to these guys.\n\nWow, what a shame....\n\nLaw Records has some other bands worth mentioning though. Such as, Passafire, Iration, and of course Pepper. Law Records also just signed Bally Hoo, and they are awesome.","2100":"I love listening to this over and over. Hang music is new to me and I was so happy to find some music to purchase. It at once is deep and meditatitve but then also makes you want to move and dance. I especially love \"Luna\".\nGreat price for a wonderful selection of music.","2101":"This song brings back alot of good memories of my early teen years. I love the album this song is on \"Welcome to my Nightmare\".","2102":"1970s, Donny Hathaway and Roberta Flack...Magical!","2103":"song","2104":"Cool song","2105":"I only have myself to blame for not checking the length of the song but silly me, I assumed the album would have the album version of Welcome To My Nightmare not some shortened single version of it.  Sadly, I can't seem to find the album version anywhere.","2106":"Of course I gave it 5 stars. I can remember going to his Welcome To My Nightmare Concert in 1975 and loved it","2107":"Love this song. It's one of my favorite jams. Whenever you need me...whenever you want me...I can be your best friend...","2108":"NOT the original release. If you want the version with the Vincent Price narrative, DO NOT purchase this mp3. Buy the actual album from a brick & morter store since Amazon Music doesn't have rights to sell the real thing.","2109":"This is a song we are singing for the first time for our Christmas play.  It is very easy for them to catch on.  The only draw back is the spoken \"and he is the best one\"  and \"Happy Birthday Jesus\"  on the end of the 2nd verse.  My students are ages 3-6.  I have no professional music background, so it has been pretty easy to teach the kids the words and we are letting the artist say the spoken parts.","2110":"If my memory serves, this was Sinatra's first major recording.  I also have the much later version, an up tempo variation to better suit his voice as it aged.  I like this version better, as it is smoother.  But this in Sinatra, and you can't go wrong with either one.","2111":"I love it! I would love to have this music in a CD. I'm buying definitely more music from this group","2112":"Beautiful music","2113":"At nearly 10 minutes, The Blue Danube (On The Beautiful Blue Danube) is one of Strauss's longest pieces. So this version is listed at 5:51 running time. Why would I want a truncated version of one of the greatest orchestral pieces of all time?","2114":"I enjoy only a few of their songs. If you like this band this is an awesome deal. . .","2115":"OUTSTANDING, LOVE IT THANK YOU!","2116":"Renee Armand's solo albums are criminally overlooked in as superb examples of late 1970s pop.  They are beautifully written, selected and performed, and well overdue for remastering and re-release.","2117":"Cool playing, great song and feels like the White Album.","2118":"If you like melodic guitar rock with a slight country blues flavor and great songs, killer playng & singing, this is a must have album.  Peter Black is an excellent singer.  The band, still led by Peter Black is now called The Orbans.  (I guess Lifters was being used too much already.)  IMHO, this album is Peter Black's finest album.","2119":"I love the Russian issued Maiden CD's as they sound great and you get the Besides as bonus tracks. I would recommend and Maden fan pick these up as they offer a cheap way to get something uniquely Maiden  at a cheap price.","2120":"I LOVE THIS SONG I SUPPOSE SOME OF WHAT SHE IS SINGING ABOUT, I HAVE ASKED MESELF SOME OF\nTHE SAME QUESTIONS.  AS AS ARTIST SHE IS AMAZING.  SOME DON'T LIKR FOR YOU TO SAY THAT IN SO SO MANY WAY, THE WAY SHE SOUNDS IS WHITNEY ALL OVER OR SO I THINK..............","2121":"I'd rather hear frogs croak, cats meow, tunas melt, cards shark, or even rocking chairs rock....or Nancy Pelosi howl at the moon.","2122":"I felt like this is a good mix for someone, just not me...low energy, inconsistent bpm, I expect better out of today's electronic mixes.","2123":"After listening to a lot of samples of house, dance, and club music mixed for continuous workout, and after reading the two 5-star reviews, I was optimistic that this would be just what I was looking for. For me, the whole point of workout music is finding something that you can listen to repeatedly and not get annoyed or offended by today's crappy oversexed lyrics. This album does offer over an hour of non-stop workout music, but about 3\/4 of the way through, I was assaulted by a pornographic track, where a woman invites her lover to \"run your fingers through my hair, everywhere, everywhere...if you dare.\" That would be tolerable, if it stopped there. But later, she repeats, \"put your finger in my AH!\" and then \"put one finger in my AH! put two fingers in my OH! put three fingers in my UH! and one more in my OH!\" I wish I were making this up, people. Trash, trash trash. I only write this review to spare someone the offense. I was in the middle of my workout, and you can't advance tracks since it is continuous, so I suffered through it for the next song... Only to be further disappointed that some techno rapper DJ dude proceeded to glorify smoking weed, getting high, passing out, and getting arrested. It seemed to allude to hard core drugs as well. Come on, people! Nothing else to live for? Don't put it on a workout track for healthy human beings, that's for darn sure! It's dirt cheap--because it's dirt. Aside from these examples, the rest of the music was a mixed bag. Not a lot of creativity going on here, and some of the sounds (\"instrumentation\") really shrill and annoying. Caveat Emptor!","2124":"I won't buy another thing like this. You get to hear a very short sample, and that's it. Thing is, this goes from okay to bad to worse and then to whatever is worse than worse. Can I return it for a refund?","2125":"MP3 downloading doesn't work for this. If you buy it there is no way to download it so all you can do is listen online.","2126":"We like the digital remaster because the quality of the music is easy to listen to. It exceeded our expectation.","2127":"Aaja captures the essence of Asia with a contemporary feel - a phenomenal fusion of cultures! Tabla, flute, guitar and piano, all flawlessly orchestrated to accompany Navin's awe inspiring vocals. Attaining levels and an intensity that he hasn't attempted in his previous songs, not only the pitch, but the power, range and variations perfectly blend from one into the other.\n\nFrom the slow soulful alaaps to the rapidly controlled sargam, one cannot help being left emotionally spent in a pleasing way when the final note fades into the distance. I can't imagine anyone not wanting their loved one to profess their affection in such exquisite style.\n\nLoving it to the extreme!","2128":"I was very disappointed in this, I do not recommend it. It doesn't even come close to what I think it should sound like.","2129":"I thought I was getting the recording made by the Beatles. Not  some other unknown.  Not  worth paying for this recording.","2130":"Don't get suckered into this one as I was. I was looking for some Beatle tunes, saw the title and assumed this was it. Didn't even come close. Unless you are a fan of this artist, save your money.","2131":"I bought this thinking the Artist was John Lennon and Paul McCartney that is what it said on the description. I am dissatisfied","2132":"GOOD.....","2133":"CAN'T PLAY 2 SONGS,...","2134":"With the discovery of the recording of the 1942-1945 OTHELLO, by Paul Robeson, the numbers of the albums prove that this recording was not only from 1939, but that it was during the \"Playwrites Company\". A witness saw the production at Jones Beach Theatre.\n\nThe partners of Amazon.com have totally falsified the recording of the tour of the 1938 Stadium Concert of Show Boat. In fact it means that this is the FIRST time that \"YOU ARE LOVE\" was written and THAT is the reason that there have been so many lies about the production. Even the EMI collection cited below, I have checked. The 1939 recordings were done in AMERICA, but EMI can transfer as they see fit. HOWEVER, one done in ENGLAND still has a different appearance than one transferred to ENGLAND. Before speaking of why I was buying the records I obtained them. They were from America.\n\nIn order to try to fake this as 1946, and long, long after anyone could remember, the BLUE SEAL, or government albums were secretly transferred out of America. Records BEFORE these, and AFTER these were combined into ONE, something Columbia never does, and it was claimed that they were from 1942 and 1945. Well, now that I have Othello, which covers that period, I am going to the National Archives and correcting this, and claiming the rights to the blue seal records that MY GRANDFATHER GAVE ME. In Addition, everyone should know, that one was allowed AD-on's in those days. The person who sang the immediate record added to this was EZIO PINZA, singing the Robison Spirituals that had been used in the original Ziegfeld Show Boat.\n\nMr. Robison came to AMERICA in early to spring 1938. He brought with him a recording from the Polish Resistence Army, of artists who were in the Jewish Ghettos. Robison had been there. This album is and they were supposed to be part of his recordings of Songs of Free Men. I had thought them lost, but they are now real and in my possession, just as directed by Joseph Toner, who told me of them. Joseph Toner wrote Polinaise, out of the great respect for Mr. Robison who had gone to the Jewish Ghetto's and come out of them with his own song, in the songs of Free Men, missing the songs OF THOSE MEN. Polinaise was produced in 1945 and sung by JOHN CHARLES THOMAS, but only the original test production was ever released, the first time the name of Wrightson was used, and no person yet found to fit the face.\n\nMr. Robeson, he was able to perform in Othello in 1943 to rave reviews. He also sang a piece by JOHN LATOUCHE about FREEDOM in AMERICA, and was outspoken in his opinions as to how persons of color were then being treated in the US. That was originally Columbia C-49 the Ballad for Americans, Feb. 9 1940. The so called 1932 reconstruction was C-55, approx 1943, and Mr. Robison had only to sing one piece, the rest could be done alone. It was to falsify that the song YOU ARE LOVE had existed. But nobody knew the devious intentions of Mr. Hammerstein. Mr. Melton certainly did.

There were other TORIGI's such as in My Fair Lady, and some very funny singing others I call the \"lounge lizard\" Torigi but I can only have 10 links so watch out for that.\n\nIt took them a long time to get the \"Strativari Strings\" rights. It was the 1943 production by the Met and Kostelanetz. We found the original.\n\nSo who sang in 1946?\n\nEveryone was told it was the Met Opera Star Brian Sullivan, whom, after Bernstein left the Met, was tossed out by Richard Rodgers. He killed himself in Geneva, a totally forgotten man.\n\nNYTimes, June 10 1969,\"Brian Sullivan, Tenor, 49 is Dead\". NOTE: \"At one point he rehearsed in Italian in 12 days the part of Count Almaviva in Rossini's Barber of Seville: in order to appear with John Charles Thomas \"The Figaro\".\n\nBrian Sullivan was with the MET from 1948-1964. When did Rodgers take control of the met? 1965.\n\n\"After the war he (Brian Sullivan) appeared as Gaylord Ravenal in Show Boat, and later in Street Sceen opening on Jan 9th 1947.\" His review of Lohgengrin is \"Music: Native Artists\"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Wagner-Lohengrin-New-York-April-13-1953-Eleanor-Steber-Margaret-Harshaw-Brian-Sullivan-Sigurd-Bjorling-Dezso-Ernster-Fritz-Stiedry-AND-Excerpts-from-January-25-1945-with-Helen-Traubel-Margaret-Harshaw-Osie-Hawkins-and-Fritz-Busch\/dp\/B001EV39RA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wagner: Lohengrin [New York -- April 13, 1953: Eleanor Steber, Margaret Harshaw, Brian Sullivan, Sigurd Bjorling, Dezso Ernster; Fritz Stiedry] AND Excerpts from January 25, 1945 with Helen Traubel, Margaret Harshaw, Osie Hawkins, and Fritz Busch<\/a><a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Weill-Street-Scene\/dp\/B0000026OM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Weill:Street Scene<\/a>&nbsp;There are dozens and dozens.\n\nWell, you all get the picture huh?\n\nIt was John Charles Thomas, IE JOSEPH TONER, who Victor claims in 1932 sang OLD MAN RIVER, BUT a different version was put on the radio in 1926, now on YouTube. We have almost completed the reconstruction of the original 1926 Show Boat. An outside expert puts the date of the 1000 series of John Charles Thomas at 1912. But recently even those that stole this rightfully copywritten american work say it is 1910. JOHN CHARLES THOMAS, the MAJOR OPERA star never appears on any historic Show Boat album by Victor.\n\nThis would make JOHN CHARLES THOMAS THE only man to have sung the piece on this side of the Atlantic, not to mention that it was not written by Hammerstein II! This is good reason to supress a person.\n\nZiegfeld would roll over in his grave.\n\nRecall what SHOW BOAT was all about, civil rights: equality, tolerance, the trouble that came from a two class society, alcoholism, gambling addiction, abandonment, the terrible plight of people of color and prejudice--I cannot give, even JOSEPH TONER AND PAUL ROBESON SINGING SIDE BY SIDE, more than one star for a product that continues what Ziegfeld was trying to END.\n\nEMI put out products that tell part of Robison's story. and definitavely document that he was not in the 1932 Show Boat. One is the EMI Sessions: The Complete EMI Sessions, 1928-1939 [Box Set] Joseph Toner and Robeson both had to sing SHOW BOAT AGAIN to let Robeson go home on the following: Showboat (Stereo LP)Show Boat I await the Shubert\/Williamson Corp.

It should not be used in a moving vehicle or any other time when you need to be fully awake and alert.\"  Then about one minute before it ends you hear yet another disclosure:  \"Warning, this session is about to end.  Please give yourself a few minutes to become completely alert before resuming normal activity.\"  And god forbid if you have these on repeat.\n\nI use these for sleep, naps, while at work, and when studying.  Essentially, it's ambient sounds to drown out any other, distracting, sounds.  Extremely annoying and very distracting.  Imagine being completely relaxed, you're feeling good; daydreaming even.

Sorry. :(","2151":"Really?  another purchase I can't explain.  It has a certain infantile rocker appeal, which probably means my tweens bought it.  Seriously, Nick who?  Hope i don't see any more of these.","2152":"If you heard this song on Pandora, this isn't the one you want to buy. It's not the complete song.","2153":"Once more I bought something from Amazon MP3 that went to their stupid and hard to use Cloud feature which is as useless as the hind tits on a boar.","2154":"I really enjoy the version of this song.","2155":"Love the music, but yet again THE CASE CAME BROKEN.  I'm getting sick of buying CDs only to find that they are messed up before I even get them.","2156":"This is vintage Hank Jones, rolled in with Duke Ellingtons compositions.  What's not to like when you have two of the royalty of jazz on one album.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because recording was 1976 and had some flaws when it was remastered.  5 stars for the music tho.","2157":"bought it by mistake but i listened to it anyway....boring..","2158":"Product does not come with a list of affirmations with MP3 download.  There is no way to obtain affirmations from company.  affirmations.bbbss@gmail.com does not work.  I should not have to repurchase the cd version of this product to obtain this list.  I do have a cd version of a different Binaural Beat Brainwave Subliminal Systems album (Learn to Say No) and the affirmations for that cd are very politically motivated.  I suspect they may be for all of their albums until I can obtain a list to verify this.","2159":"Noticed no effect at all from using this.  Months later, I read a book on subliminals written by Eldon Taylor.  He says that most of these subliminal tapes have NOTHING in the background and rely on the placebo effect to change a person.  I would guess that this is one of the 'fakes' because I literally noticed nothing from using it.","2160":"BEWARE this is NOT the FULL VERSION!!!","2161":"I needed the songs from this album to resurrect a compilation album fro the 80's.. called rock 80. An album put out by K-Tel records.","2162":"Must have for early morning rides to the blind.\nJust brings up all those great memories of fun hunts with great people.","2163":"I can't believe this site, user friendly must be a very foreign word.\nI won't be back to down-load music, this is forsure.","2164":"Whether they work as advertised or not the sounds are relaxing and help me focus.  If not for the annoying voice that says not to operate machinery they would also be perfect study\/work music.  This one has lovely birds, crickets, water, and you cannot hear the subliminal messages.  Its not at all distracting like instrumental\/vocal music.","2165":"ok","2166":"Boden's \"Folk Song A Day\" project is wonderful--the purpose supposedly is to encourage social singing, to make you confident enough to sing yourself, but never mind that, we can't all be Jon Boden and toss off a brilliant rendition of a folk song at the drop of a hat. What you have here is an amazing amount of folk music for a cheap price--you can listen for free over at the \"Folk Song A Day\" website, but Boden should be encouraged with cash on the barrelhead--where the 365 songs total in the twelve monthly albums is some enormous part of the British folksong tradition. The heart of his endeavor is traditional English folksong, but he has healthy amounts of Irish and Scottish folksong, modern songs (folk, pop, musicals, humorous, etc.), and a fair dollop of songs composed by and\/or sung by Boden's idol, Peter Bellamy. A fair sprinkling of the songs sung in the \"Folk Song A Day\" project appear later in Boden's solo or joint albums--he was trying them out here first, I think. Boden's great strength is interpretation--he makes you listen to the songs' words and think about what they mean, makes coherent stories out of them. To that he adds a fine voice--better than Bellamy's, for a not so random example. I cannot recommend these highly enough.\n\nIn this month I am particularly fond of \"Tyne of Harrow\", \"Cruel Mother\" and \"Child Morris\".","2167":"Anteriromente a este cd compre otro q nunca llego, apenas envie mi queja Amazon realizo la investigacion  y a los pocos dias me devolvieron el dinero. El servicio de Amazon es Excelente!!!!! Este lo recibi en 6 dias y  esta muy bueno.","2168":"Was not worth my money.  Not sure if I was recommended a different version or what.  There was only 1-2 hours of content total and nothing worth noting.  Find personal development elsewhere.  I suggest Dani Johnson.","2169":"Not what I expected.  I thought it was a comedy album, not just ringtones.","2170":"Performance is very good but recording quality not good.","2171":"I brought this album back in the 60s.  It was my favorite album till someone stole it.  Bobby Rydell singing Bobby's Girl and Telestar are really great. I have looked for this album for years. This is the only version I have heard of Telestar that has words.  I highly recommend this album to everyone.","2172":"Traditional music, great voice, perfect for morning and evening prayers. Sri Balasubramaniam, known for playback singing in South Indian movies, can do a superb job on Karnataka music, too.","2173":"garbage","2174":"There are sounds and there are very special sounds. This is one of the latter.\nSteve Ripley, front man for The Tractors,  joins the well known Red Dirt Ranges group in a tribute to what is right with America.\n  In these times of trial, I think this is an important part of helping maintain proper perception of who we are, where we've been and how we got to this point. Only in that context can we make wise decisions on where we go from here.\n  If you aren't familiar with Red Dirt music, this is a great introduction. It is somewhere between Western Swing, Country & Western, Bluegrass and Southern Rock. Where, exactly, I have no idea. I just know it has a brand of smooth and easy that I find enjoyable. If you like any of the above or even patriotic music, I can't see why you shouldn't love this one.\nIt knocked my sox off.","2175":"I don't know what to say; okay, this song makes me smile and dance. I don't think my bottom would be described as \"fat\"--but I'm not skinny like a model either--so this song is sort of parody (to me) of California Girls! Just have fun with it!","2176":"yuck","2177":"We have followed Suzanne's writing for quite some time, and our Family has enjoyed every piece.  We look forward to the next one!  Thanks Suzanne for all the hours of enjoyment.\n\nRichard, Kathryn, and Gloria","2178":"Love Rick & Bubba and have wanted to get a copy of Stay In It for a long time. Every time I hear the 'story that would never be told' I just about pop a valve laughing so hard! Imagine my disappointment when I realized the first 11 tracks are all out of order! I tried to edit the info in iTunes but that doesn't seem to have resolved the issue. Whenever I sync the album to a portable device, be it an iPod Touch, Droid X or whatever, the original data comes back and it, thus, all out of order again!","2179":"I thought this extend remix would be great but very little essence of the original song comes through. Oh well.","2180":"great song I have heard this song so in diifrent remixes also I still remember listening to this song back in high school","2181":"an awful new remix! produced in 2012 by the bolland brothers, it  is just a horror cabinet of every cheap falco nostalgia...\n\nbetter stay with the 1985\/86 original remixes which can be found here:\nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B01DGIBFT2\/ref=dm_ws_sp_ps_dp","2182":"I purchased two Falco RMA songs. I was looking for the US version with some biography. The first was the Falco original as I did not know the difference. Then I heard the preview of this one and figured it had to be correct. I recognized the American voice doing the biography, but the preview track was not long enough to verify if it was the one I sought. It wasn't the correct one and I can't figure out if Amazon even has it or not.","2183":"Warning, this remaster of the 25th anniversary has the same problem so many copies of F3 have had on CD over the years, no long versions of Rock Me Amadeus (Salieri Version) and the 7-minute version of Vienna calling. These versions were the way apparently the way the old cassette's were and we all got used to those awesome versions. I am not certain why there has ever been different versions of this album released. I did find the correct version of F3 from Germany about ten years ago but paid over 35 dollars for a used, like new copy. If you are looking for the way this album was originally released in the US, it just does not exist here with this version. This is trash for not at least including the two extended Salieri versions as extras. Shame on you Sony!!!!","2184":"LOOKING FOR ROCK ME AMADEUS BIOGRAPHY VERSION, NOT ON CD JUST REGULAR VERSION. $26.00 LOST. VERY DISAPPOINTED! THE BIOGRAPHY VERSION HAS THE ROARING GUITAR AND SPEECH AS THE OPENING TO THE SONG!","2185":"Great Buy","2186":"So my wife and 11 year old son steal my password and this is what they decide to purchase!?!  What, was Electric Avenue unavailable to stream?  Time to start shielding the 5 year old from the musically wayward.","2187":"Ok","2188":"Angela and Aubrey, aka The Doubleclicks, are clearly clever and gifted musicians.  What they're developing, starting here, is the voice -- the unique auditory and perspective that clearly defines who they are -- that makes other musical acts so successful.  And that voice is wry, clever, sometimes abrupt, and always amazing and amusing.  The words, and the sentiment, speak directly to those of us in the Geekish Clan absolutely brilliantly.\n\nThis album is an excellent beginning, and I can't wait to see the work that follows it.","2189":"Not as soothing as I had hoped.","2190":"When I saw the title of this track I said to myself \"I have to get this\"  It looked so inviting. One minute after playing it, I regret my decision. The songs are long and boring and just makes no sense. I wish I could delete it from my device.","2191":"I seen this video\/song on TV somewhere, and I just liked it a lot !! So, I purchased it !! Nice groove to music !!","2192":"This song should be played before each Packed game. Don't forget the beer and brats.","2193":"The songs you love with updated pep.","2194":"Love this music. A unique sound for very traditional music.","2195":"Good music in memory of a  good leader whose life was cut short by the enemies of change in a country that was crying for it .","2196":"Song with message good for parents to teach and teens to learn a quick lesson. Catchie tune cant stop singing it","2197":"Upon first hearing this track, \"Why Even Try,\" in Spring 2011, you feel like you're floating in a dream crossed between heaven and paradise.  It's a real pretty song.  Sara Quin doesn't sing in a high note for it.  My favorite is \"Humdrum Town\" though.  My niece was helping me search for some cell phone ring tones when I came across \"Humdrum Town.\"  It's not on this album though.  The beat sounds like it's in the Trance genre.  The rhythm is choppy which keeps it fresh.  That notably fast sharp syncopated note keeps this track concise and to the point.  I also like \"I Stand Alone.\"  He hails from T & T!","2198":"This is one of Dead or Alive's BEST tracks ever.  Fun song with cool lyrics and an edgy and artsy video featuring Pete Burns and the gang in their prime... this is a GEM!!!  And I LOVE the remixed versions almost as much as the long original album cut.  So much energy, and the track holds up well against today's music, thanks to the S\/A\/W production.  If you like Dead or ALive, and you do NOT have at least ONE version of \"Something In My House\", then you are truly missing some EPIC Dead or Alive stuff here.","2199":"Former Rainbow keyboardist Tony Carey scored hit biggest hit in the spring of 1984 with \"A Fine, Fine Day\".  The song sounds like a Bruce Springsteen or Bob Seger knockoff.  The song has swirling keyboards and heavy echo that sounds like a tribute band trying to come up with some original River era music of their own.  Mr. Carey's vocals show why he was hired to be a keyboardist for Rainbow.  The song is saved by the fact he does do a pretty decent job of clipping a Springsteen style sound.  The song was the first of his two Top 40 hits, peaking at number 22.","2200":"This is one of my favorite dance songs. I have it in my \"driving\/party\/workout\/housework\" mix, because it gets me moving :)","2201":"Mr. Dave's most recent disc has some great playing, but doesn't match the highlights of the Lindley\/Ingram series of discs(particularly Twango Bango Deluxe!!). He is the real deal and should be a household name if there were any justice.

What a shame. This is a great selection of songs that don't seem to be easy to find on one compilation. But who wants an inferior version of them?","2205":"Another re-recordings rip-off ----- avoid like the plague. Junk Junk Junk Junk Junk and JUNK ---- AVOID. Amazon needs to pull these offerings and get the original recordings.","2206":"One of my all time favorite songs.","2207":"Nice Songs.","2208":"This song has become my favorite out of my Luka library. It's a must have for any fan, or anyone interested in its type.\n\nAlso keep in mind that it's in japanese. Here are the english lyrics though.\n\n-----\n\nI tripped and fell, and laughed after hiding the sky I was drawing\nI bowed my head and while pretending to be oblivious, stood under the umbrella alone\n\nThe future feels like it's about to disappear everytime I wish for something\nEverytime I cling, I become dyed in black\n\nSolve it and don't touch me, even when I'm dyed in sadness\nThe color of you hand that I grabbed while laughing\nIs forgotten - The day I close my eyes\nThe colorful world will surely turn into black and white\n\nI repeat \"goodbye\" and traced \"see you again\"\nI decided to cry.\nSaying since bowing my head hurts, that I don't need warmth\n\nThe future feels like it's about to disappear everytime I wish for something\nEverytime I cling, I'm painted in white\n\nIf, if in the hollow world,\nI can live only by embracing\nYour fading sound that echoes and smears\nDo I need any other songs?\n\nIn the touch that I longed for,\nThe color blue was hurt and buried\nI reach out my hand and cut off the connection\nUntil everything rots away\n\nEven when I touch, connect, and dye in sadness,\nOur hands echo and smear\nThe world that I drew while embracing and overlapping\nPaints me in vivid colors countless times","2209":"Great version of this wonderful song.  Our choir sang it recently and I was thrilled to find this version on Amazon so I can listen to it often.","2210":"I was walking around the other day, as happy as Larry, when a memento mori came to mind. At first I could not place it. Hours later, it came to me: it was the development, for lack of a better word, in the first movement of Moments Musicaux. Fearsome in the reaping, it brought the nihilism of the Tempest to mind:\n\n\"Our revels now are ended. These our actors, as I foretold you, were all spirits and are melted into air, into thin air:  And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,  the cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples, the great globe itself, ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve and, like this insubstantial pageant faded,  leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.\"\n\nWhat then, of castles in the air?\n\nI normally avoid D 780  and the first two movements in particular  like Red Spot-itis. Theyre scarier, IMO, than Death and the Maiden or Winterreise. Is it not amazing that Schubert could be so brave, with so little happiness in the bank and beleaguered by dissolution as he was? Think too, that somehow or other melody parries darkness in a sphere beyond the temporal. On this occasion, I thought it best to heed the omen so I sought out a new recording. Aunty Mitsuko came into frame and went just as quickly. It was news to me that Gilels had recorded it  he was a tad too fast for my liking. I don't know who Shino Moroto is. I daresay shell attract the attention of the worst elements of the Australian Knappertsbusch Association - animals one and all! In any event, this lass can play. Imagination, touch, depth of tone and ease with the space between notes  she has it all. Moroto is also cognisant that Schuberts piano-works are more penses than fodder for the concert hall: intimacy is always apparent. Insofar as one can enjoy D 780, she delivers the goods. Unblinkingly, the anguish and desolation of MM 1 & 2 are vented. She could possibly go harder in MM 5. Moroto also guns D 899. Just listen to her in the famous G-Flat Impromptus: one could float away in the breeze! Thats perfection!\n\nRecording-wise, this is phenomenal. As she weaves her magic, all one say is \"Bravo Shino!\"","2211":"He put's those one cd\/dvd versions in the public library as a teaser to get you to buy the $250 versions. He uses the public library system as a marketing tool. I though public libraries were for society, not for tony's personal money making stratigy. I've spent hundreds on Tony's stuff, but I'm done. This is the ultimate unethical stratagy.","2212":"Tony Robbins is an expert on saying the same things over and over and over and over again but repackaging them differently so it seems like its a different message each time.  He has been shouting and touting the same old messages for almost 20 years and these CD's say nothing different that I haven't heard him say anywhere else or on youtube videos for that matter.\n\nI am just soooo glad I have never been coerced by temptation to attend his seminars and literally pay thousands of dollars for attending. Or even to pay several hundreds of dollars for his CDs. I found this set for next to nothing on ebay. I feel sorry for the countless thousands who have emptied their pockets to bulge Tony Robbin's while they have been mesmerized by hollow Pied Piper tunes to the lure of \"come follow me and I will lead you to ga ga dreamland \".  In my opinion Tony Robbins borders on being a fraudulent crook and a sham.","2213":"THis music gave me cancer!!!!!!! now im bald and living in Uzbekistan! do you know how cold it is out here? i bet you dont. so don't buy this bad for the brain crap junk music. this is pure junk and stupid  snoop dog out!#$","2214":"good song","2215":"Cool old song. HOWEVER, I think this is a remixed or re-recorded version. It doesn't seem to have the same punch as the radio versus I hear every once in a while.","2216":"this is a redub, Jay re-recorded about 40 years later, good but lacks the same gusto as the original.","2217":"This song is bad for so many reasons. Here are these reasons:\n1. Justin Bieber doesn't have the proper voice for this song. His voice is too high pitched and childlike.\n2. The song is unoriginal and predictable. Nothing special about it. Just a typical teen love song.\n3. The lyrics are poorly written, boring and repetitive.\n4. The music does not fit the song. It's too techno for a love song.\nIn my opinion, this is Justin Bieber's worst song ever. He never should of sang it.","2218":"For the nephew","2219":"In simple words, this album is a misconception!!  All but one or two are obviously NOT the originals.  Even at $6.99, this is a ripoff because we the consumer are misled into thinking we're getting originals.  Beware!!!","2220":"If you like gorillaz, you will enjoy this, pretty artsy though. I like that.\n\nits like listening to a modern day coppola movie.","2221":"The second half is obviously not the original recordings. Arrangements are different and so is the tonal quality as well as instrumentation. But what do you expect; it's K-tel records. Its like Eric is a sellout. Very disappointing.","2222":"A really sucky remake album... not the originals... I highly recommend not to purchase this album nor any of the ones Amazon sells as Digital media.","2223":"I had hoped these would be the original recordings and they are not.  What a disappointment.","2224":"I should have listened to all the songs. This is a remastered piece of work with a different arrangement than the originals. I don't like them as well.","2225":"I bought this expecting the original 1960's recording but this is much later and with different arrangements to suit Eric's withered voice.","2226":"There were scratches on the cd do not buy this the condition was supposed to be good.","2227":"Case was cracked but cd worked good","2228":"This collection is not the original released recordings.  They are either re-recorded by the original lead vocalists or a flat knock-off imitation.  Find another series if you're trying to find original versions.","2229":"Really fun music.","2230":"What a terrible purchase, I did not realize I was buying crappy cover songs. I'd rather buy a Justin Bieber album.","2231":"Not as beautiful as the original, this sounds like it was made with a drum machine. Awful vocals too. Yuck. I regret I bought it.","2232":"Chose \"Spill the Wine\" by the Animals and when I played it, it did not sound like the Animals version at all. Right song - wrong group. Bummer....","2233":"I don't like this version. Not nearly as good as the original studio version. I guess that is why it was 89 cents.","2234":"The song downloaded chopped off and not complete","2235":"I have no complaints.","2236":"This is an awesome song.","2237":"This song is a classic and I love how easy it is to download and store in my music section whether its one song or the whole album just love the quick and easy service and how you can find any song you want without even knowing the name of song.","2238":"i heard this song first at the victoria secret's fashion show.  it is an amazing piece and you can't go wrong with it.","2239":"Missing songs that were there!!","2240":"Re Recording-  Amazon should not carry the re-recordings.  Not happy with this at all.  Wish I could get my money back, but lesson learned","2241":"Don't Buy It. These are re-recordings. Not Originals. I wish Amazon would stop carrying these recordings. They are not worth it.","2242":"most are remakes,good songs but not the original.this albumb has some great songs and memories,but i prefer the original recordings.","2243":"Former Super Junior member, Han Geng, has done an excellent job on his solo album. I absolutely love it. This song in particular is really good. It's catchy, has a good beat, and is fun to sing and dance to. A great song if you are a fan on Mandopop. Anyway, great song. Highly recommend it!","2244":"Terrible collection!! Except for \"Be Thankful For What You've Got\", all the other songs are re-records, meaning they are NOT the original radio versions. I was looking for \"Cinnamon\" and it sounds easily like a knock off. Not recommended, unless of course, you like remakes of originals, which I don't!","2245":"Requested by and purchased for a teenager; who loves it.","2246":"My husband has the entire ONXRT series. Love each and every one.","2247":"Lame plot & story.  I usually like anything Star Trek. Captain Sulu Adventures were a good idea, but the stories are just bad.","2248":"Bought by mistake. Thought it was a video instead of audio.","2249":"Now I know why it was so hard to find: it is terrible. For the most part, it is remixes (for lack of a better word) of classic pre- Island Records' Wialers' tunes, done in 80's electronic style. Honestly, it is tough to even tell it is reggae. It is very poor sound quality as well. Don't buy. My seller was great, it is the product that's the issue.","2250":"Ok. Not a superstitious or easily scared person but had a creepy experience twice after falling  asleep to this. Won't go into detail but beyond scary. Just know that binaural beats split your mind open and vulnerable. Watch out!","2251":"Track starts with a \"Warning\". So it is not suitable for trying to sleep with it on repeat as the \"Warning\" wakes me up.","2252":"What is the point of this? I have tried it a few times. Doesn't actually help me sleep at all, but even if it did it's no good as far as I'm concerned. Near the end of the track a loud voice starts to announce that you are coming to the end of the program. I've never heard the rest because I am jolted awake and quickly trying to turn it off. I've been at least calmer at the point and then once I hear the voice, very awake and frustrated.","2253":"I've been monitoring my sleep with a Zeo sleep monitor system that measures your actual brainwave patterns while sleeping.  Unaided, I typically get 5-20 minutes of delta wave (aka deep sleep) sleep.  I removed the two vocal warnings at the beginning and ending of this and used it on auto-repeat with headphones last night.  My Zeo measured a whopping 13 mins of delta wave sleep; no statistical improvement over unaided sleep for me.\n\nI'm a believer in the effectiveness of binaural beats and therefore disappointed that so many of these MP3s like this don't produce results.  I suspect the process of making an audio track into an MP3 actually destroys the binaural beats (MP3 conversion strips out frequencies the converter thinks you won't notice as missing as part of the compression scheme); however, if you listen carefully I think you can hear the tones behind the water noises.  Perhaps the CD version of this would work better.\n\nThe water sounds aren't unpleasant, and they seem to be fairly consistent in volume, so I gave an extra star, but in the end, if you advertise as a product that produces deep sleep and you don't, I can't recommend it.","2254":"Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful!","2255":"Great","2256":"Sor this on my instrumental list always looking for lots of kinds of peaceful music amazon are selling it so I got one true fab god how does he play like that I picked up the guitar at 9 iam 46 now strum and pick is all I can do","2257":"Song not for ME,  I guess my wife like it.\n ( this  song could be 5 stars,  listen for yourself  ).","2258":"Love And One, possibly my favorite band this album is no exception.","2259":"This song got my attention when it first came out. Great techno sound. She's got a cool voice, and the backup harmony is very well done. It's just a shame that Robyn never really caught on in the U.S.","2260":"Awsome","2261":"Born in New York City in 1917, orchestra arranger\/conductor Robert \"Bob\" Mersey began his long career in the late 1930s with the Big Bands of Abe Lyman and Woody Herman before joining NBC radio after WW II as their staff arranger. Following a stint in Europe in the late 1940s where he scored several film soundtracks, he returned to the U.S. in the 1950s, joining the Gordon Jenkins orchestra as their arranger. He followed that with the same work at Big Top Records, a label launched in 1958 by Johnny Bienstock, where he also released one single under the pseudonym Spencer Ross,  Bobby's Blues\/Theme Of A Lonely Evening  (Big Top 3035) in 1960. It did not chart nationally.\n\nHe then moved over to Columbia and CBS TV, and their subsidiary Colpix where, mostly under his real name Robert Mersey, he did arranging\/conducting for artists like Andy Williams (some 17 of Andy's hits were backed by Mersey), as well as Barbra Streisand, Johnny Mathis, Nina Simone, James Darren, Aretha Franklin, Johnny Nash, Dion (DiMucci), Frankie Avalon and many more. He also found time to release three more singles of his own and one LP as Spencer Ross, with the first being his only claim to national fame in terms of a hit record. That was Tracy's Theme, written by Robert Archer for the female character in the December 7, 1959  CBS TV production The Philadelphia Story, originally a 1940 film and, in 1956, re-made as the musical High Society. Featuring the great saxophone work of Jimmy Abalo, and released as Columbia 4-41532 under the billing Spencer Ross, it peaked at # 13 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in January\/February 1960 b\/w Thanksgiving Day Parade, from the TV production Miracle On 34th Street. Why it never made any impact on the Adult Contemporary (Easy Listening) charts at the time is a mystery since it was a perfect fit for those listings.\n\nThat success led to the 1960 album covered here, titled simply Spencer Ross & His Orchestra (Columbia CL-1525\/CS 8325) containing:  La Montana (If She Should Come To You); Carolina Moon; I Go; Dreamy Melody; Theme From \"I Am A Camera\" (Why Do I?); Hop, Skip, Jump; Tracy's Theme; Song For A Summer Night; Solitaire; Play Some Music For Broken Hearts; What's It Like In Paree?; Your Continental Touch. Two of the tracks - Song For A Summer Night\/Dreamy Melody then came out as the single Columbia 4-41644, and a bit later in 1960 he had Theme From \"My Three Sons\"\/Heaven Can Wait r4eleased as Columbia 4-41877. Neither could get him back on the charts, nor did his interpretation of Song Of India which, billed as The Bob Mersey Orchestra, came out as one side of Colpix 152 (the flip, Strangers When We Meet by the Stu Phillips orchestra, didn't chart either).\n\nIn 1962 he apparently released an acclaimed - and yet obscure - album on Gallant Records titled Great Jazz From Great TV which, although showing on the label that it was composed, arranged and conducted by Bob Mersey, was credited to yet another pseudonym - \"Det Moore & His Orchestra.\" This contains: Jazz Dramatic; Club Cool; Forever Frantic; Call Girl; and Flutesville, among others from shows like Ben Casey, Route 66, The New Breed, Manhunt, My Three Sons, Window On Main Street, Armstrong Circle Theater, Kraft Mystery Theater, and Play Of The Week.\n\nI'm surprised some outfit like Collectables or Collector's Choice hasn't yet remastered both albums for CD format. If they do, one would hope they'd include those non-album sides mentioned as \"bonus\" tracks. If all you want is Tracy's Theme an excellent copy can be found in Eric Records wonderful volume Hard To Find Orchestral Instrumentals.","2262":"I have all the Jada dance and pop songs from the years. And now I hear they can sing midtempo\/r&b as well...and they sing it extremely well! This is such a nice song to listen to the lyrics to as it describes situations we all have been in through life. Once again with all the Jada songs, I can hear their soulful voices in every word they song, and the music and beat compliment them very well. I love how their music compliments their amazing singing ability, and not the other way around like the majority of pop\/r&b artists. A+++ to Break Up Song :)","2263":"I was looking for wedding songs and downloaded this after listening to the sample. The song itself does not go into much more depth than what is given in the sample. I had hoped that there would be a lot more to the lyrics than a repetition of you're the one, which extended beyond the chorus line into the verses. If you are searching for a song which conveys a depth of love, this is not the song for you. I\"m in Love with You on the Prepare the Way album has more depth, and is of a similar tempo; or Golden by Chrisette Michelle.","2264":"Please do not buy this song. I am using this song in my wedding Sunday, and it is not the right track. When I played it, it is a totally different song. I will never trust anything else from Amazon again. Their solution: refund my $0.99. Seriously??? I am getting married in 4 days, 3 hours, 22 minutes!! Who cares about $0.99??? They had nothing to offer for their website advertising one thing and selling something that's totally different. I am done!","2265":"Great","2266":"Mike Roylance makes the tuba sing.  It's a super recording.  Love it and play it often ... even shared it with an alum of The President's Own.  It's a \"must have\" recording.","2267":"Very disappointed,  Not as good as the previews sounded. poor presentation and sloppy pick work in many of the songs","2268":"I really enjoyed this album from beginning to end. It had such a sweet sound that was satisfying. Some of the tracks had such fun arrangements, it was a delight to hear.","2269":"It's good","2270":"I listened to song after I had to download it into my player and there is more than two to three minutes of silence in the middle of track  cant not figure out how to return it, not sure if this is right song or not","2271":"Hailing from upstate NY, the Spring Standards wowed a small crowd this summer (2010) at a WXPN-sponsored show in Haddon Lake Park in South Jersey.  Except for an occasional assist by the band's manager on second guitar, the band was a self-contained trio of multi-taskers.  Heather Robb, James Cleave and James Smith sang lead and harmony and simultaneously covered either bass and bass drum, acoustic guitar and high-hat, or piano\/organ and snare\/tom.  The drum parts were lockstep - you'd have sworn there was a drummer hidden behind a speaker column.  All but track two (due to language) made it to the live show.  So what does the disc sound like?  Pretty much the same as the infectious live show.  Scattershot blues (\"Here I Am\").  Cabaret piano (\"Queen of the Lot\").  Scrappy Appalachian backbeats (\"The Hush\").  Fingerstyle ballads (\"Frozen\").  Decemberists-style rock (\"Not Again\").  And lots of layered vocals in unusually close harmonies (\"Skyline,\" \"Bells and Whistles,\" \"Trouble\").  If you crossed Paul Simon, Lady Antebellum, and the Pretenders, would things be different?  It's likely -- the Spring Standards have set a new one.","2272":"Very disappointed, this track was supposed to be silent. It is NOT. Grrr","2273":"A brief story: When I heard the track Mercedes Benz (Janice Joplin's amusing ditty) on a local jazz station, I was transported back in time and place. It was my first exposure to Nguyn L's guitar, which can mimic the Vietnamese zither, the dan tranh. Suddenly, it was the late 1960's and the Vietnam War was a clear and present danger. Moreover, the interlude suggested the Grateful Dead's soundtrack to Apocalypse Now. This album covers tunes of my youth, and although they are not as powerful in effect as the mentioned track, and are somewhat uneven in arrangement with undistinguished vocals, they are fun to hear with their modern and global intepretation, with flavors of India, Vietnam, and the Middle East. L is mainly a jazz musician but this album is more rock in style, and it suffers by it. [How can I put aside the deeply etched original Beatles, Joplin, Stevie Wonder, Bob Marley issues? A pure instrumental album would have been better.] L has over a dozen other musicians and vocalists involved in this 70-minute long album. The album is probably L's venture into the popular market, and I hope that the cross-over is just a visit. For his truly world jazz album, see Saiyuki.","2274":"The sound quality of this file is horrid.","2275":"didn't get the mix I was looking for, bought 2 of them.  your welcome.","2276":"Happy's done much better.","2277":"Yall not lil Wayne fans because if yall was yall would know this was a free mixtape","2278":"I am usually a huge Wayne fan and think everything he touches is money but I have to admit I wish I would have listened to all of the previews before I rushed into buying this on his name alone.","2279":"Beautiful song. Use it for Senior Recognition at church, and it is the perfect song.","2280":"I only wanted to buy and download and did not want a digital copy. It appears to have charged me twice and I just wanted the mp3. Can you correct this issue?\n\nThanks","2281":"When my mother passed away I bought this song.  It is comforting and inspiring.  I really could see her singing those words to me.","2282":"I was a huge nwa fan and to hear how dre has fallen when he released this was a crying shame yes dre you need your head examined making these wack azz tecxhno beats and eminem don't help either he should have kept this track for himself ans I think skylar grey's a bad singer she fits in with this techno crap's that's coming out. sorry doc if detox sounds like this I'm not buying.","2283":"Cam did it again! From start to finish i enjoyed it so much! I caught myself nodding my head in amazement of how he challenges the listener to bold and he touces on topics that alot of people won't even get clost to. \"stop calling me texting me\" it hit home and instead of being critical about it i chose to embrase it and realize that as christians and believers, we go through stuff like that. thank you cam for keeping it real! i always enjoyed cam and lecrae working together and i miised cam in overdose and rehab plus all reach records artists lately and lecrae doesnt come out in this one but all in all its all great music. thank you for blessing my life because through this music i am able to continue to go hard and not quit in the faith!!!!! be bold and not be ashamed of my savior! you need to hear it for yourself!!!!!! get it now!!!!!","2284":"Both the content and the music are off the chain!!!  I'm VERY happy with this purchase.  Cam is awesome!!  Praise the Lord for him.","2285":"There is no question that Dr. Dre had been absent from the music scene for a very long time. It feels like the world had really passed by in his absence. The last time he was heard was in 2001 with his sequel to The Chronic. Yet, he has awaited a long time to come out with something new. With rap fans eagerly anxious over his Detox release, he has shown his age, and his loss with I Need A Doctor, the lead single from that album. The song really isn't very strong in his collaboration with Enimem, and instead lets Eminem take the spotlight over him. I really felt that they did lose a lot of chemistry. He really did let the rhymes slide. I think Dr. Dre really does need a doctor right now. Hopefully, he'll get better with Detox coming out, if it does come alive soon.\n\nSong: D-","2286":"One of their better ones.","2287":"Sabrina is a young lady going places, she is fantastic, buy everything she sings.","2288":"Another great song.  Expect to see a lot more from this blossoming artist.  She can really put a lot of emotion into her work.","2289":"I am picky, so i chose the songs i like.","2290":"My wife is filipino and I heard music playing a Pintig function here in Chicago and asked the stage crew who made the song and they told me so I bought the album and listen to over and over again.","2291":"Love this song in English and now I am like to listen to music in Spanish so I got the Spanish version.  Love Marc  Anthony.","2292":"I've been a fan of Urge Overkill for a long, long time.  This song is, in my opinion, easily the best track on an otherwise \"middling\" album.  Exit the Dragon oscillates between good, classic Urge songs and throwaway tracks, but this one is a keeper.","2293":"God, Family, love of country and serving. Honored to be an American and free. Let freedom ring, let freedom ring, God let freedom ring.","2294":"The burden removing, yoke destroying power of God flows through Dorinda every time she opens her mouth to sing!

INFACT THE VERY LAST SONG WAS NOT ON THE ORIGINAL LP (I OWNED IT SO I KNOW + I'M A FIRST CHOICE FAN FROM 1973 WHEN THEIR FIRST LP WAS RELEASED (ARMED AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS) TO 1980 WHEN THEIR LAST LP WAS RELEASED (BREAKWAY )& THE 3 IN BETWEEN (THE PLAYER-1974  DELUSIONS-1977  HOLD YOU HORSES-1979) WHEW I'D A BEEN FUMING HAD I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I COULD HAVE PURCHASED THE MP3 FORMAT OF THE WHOLE CD (ITS NO LONGER AVAILABLE ON AMAZON AFTER 10 YEARS?) BUT A FRIEND DID PURCHASE IT IN 2006 JUST FOR ME IN MP3 FORMAT & BURNED ME A CD SO ITS NOT LIKE I DONT OWN IT +  THE SOUND IS FABULOUS. I WAS ONLY PURCHASING THIS ONE BECAUSE IT DID HAVE THE ACTUAL ORIGINAL FRONT COVER (THE GIRLS ARE MISSING FROM THE BACK COVER ON THIS RELEASE (ON THE ORIGINAL THEY WERE EACH POSED,LAYED OUT ON A CLOUD -ANY TRUE FAN WOULD REMEMBER THAT,LOL.) NAW,DONT WASTE YOUR $$$$,I BET IT SOUNDS AWFUL ALSO?","2299":"Can't put in my Galaxy S6 library. Can only hear on cloud. Amazon can't help!","2300":"An underground soul classic!","2301":"I purchased this album several years ago and ,as today, I can't sit to hear the whole thing. I admit there some nice orchestration here and there but every piece is a protest song or some kind of social comment. I want music to move me, not to lecture me. This album is so dense that I don't feel the salsa vibe it needs. Salsa music is about fun, dance, etc. I really missed his flavor on earlier albums like \"Siembra\" and such. Even those albums contained some social content but they were very enjoyable.","2302":"She had an amazing voice!! Love Linda:)","2303":"Excellent","2304":"This was misleading . It's just one phrase repeated.","2305":"I just love to hear this before I exercise. Gets me pumped up.  The show itself is mediocre, at best, but this is a great song!!!","2306":"I like this song a lot because it is in a different musical style from many of Weird Al's other songs. Even so, the lyrics are silly and engaging and make me laugh out loud. The rhythm is driving and the tune pretty much always gets stuck in my head.","2307":"awesome","2308":"Great listening pleasure.","2309":"Since this is a single, obviously this review will be short.  Tight song! upbeat and a good club beat.  The extras are pretty sweet...dont know if it is worth [the price].....if you REALLY like the song, then go for it, otherwise wait to find it online...","2310":"Jay Perez has an excellent voice, and his backup group adds much flavor\nto the piece.  The music makes you want to dance your toes off!","2311":"Historical recording. The story behind this is hilarious. Check \"Warner's Seven Aces\".","2312":"LUV IT !","2313":"One of the few 80's song remakes that actually works and improves on the original song while keeping the fun of of it.","2314":"This is one time where I will say the remake outshines the original song.  Pseudo Echo has a much better sound and beat.","2315":"Me thinks...shame........unofficial release. Hopefully one day we'll have a decent sounding Official release.\n  For Mandrill and their Music on this LP though.","2316":"Oh how I wish I could get all of their songs on discs.  Needs more and more,  we do.","2317":"this is one of my favorite Tito Puente songs. Truly a legend, you will love this song, i recommend it.","2318":"I could not get this to download correctly so never got to listen to it.","2319":"Arrived on time. Was as expected. I grew a 3 foot beard. What more can I ask for?","2320":"Didnt realize it was a mix, but it's awful. Jump and fail. Its a very simple fun song that doesnt need a remix.","2321":"Great song!","2322":"Love this version, it keeps me motivated.  Anything's possible when you're happy inside.","2323":"Not much to say. I just don't like the song. I thought I would but I didn't. Other people may though.","2324":"It's hard to rate a AGBPOL album as mediocre, but The Fiery Works EPs are just that. The song writing is just standard pop rock, which isn't necessarily bad, but just nothing incredible. To see how much they've grown into their own unique sound with Have You Seen My Prefrontal Cortex? and their best effort so far, You're Always On My Mind. When compared to those two, it's just mediocre albums. The sound isn't that tight and the vocals are really raw. The Fiery Works II is probably my least favorite of the two. The songs aren't as good as the previous one, in my opinion. If you're new to the band, skip these for now, but if you've listened to the new albums and you've become a fan, then it's nice to check these out and see how much they've grown.","2325":"thanks","2326":"Sucky Radio Edit","2327":"Great song","2328":"My review has nothing to do with the music, but rather with the system Amazon uses to download music.  I was not able to  purchase  this item because it wouldn't  download.  I called and got assistance from Amazon, but it still wouldn't download.  I don't know why Amazon changed the system it  had before which made downloading simple, but the present system (since the advent of that Cloud thing) is terrible.  I am sorry not to be able to download any more music as I can't get through the awful  system.  I love music and love The Right Time of Night and the artist, but I do not love  Amazon's system for downloading.  I wish I did purchase the above song.  I  didn't, because i couldn't.","2329":"Love this song but this version is strange. They completely changed the lyrics in part of the song, I think. I can't make out what they're saying after \"Willie and lilly got married last fall\" but it sure isn't the lyricsI'm used to hearing.","2330":"I've loved everything from Cantus. Their harmonies give me chills. I may even like them better than Chanticleer. Simple Gifts is a favorite from ages ago for me. I judge this version to be one of the best.","2331":"Classic Rock from a era that was filled with many genre's of music.\nPaul Davis looked like a rocker from Lynrd Skynrd but made easy going pop rock.\nTo bad he left us too soon.","2332":"Too much with the imitations. Indulgent.","2333":"It's hard to rate a AGBPOL album as mediocre, but The Fiery Works EPs are just that.

However; this song is a rock\/pop gem, Ann Margret's vocals are powerful and soulful. The song has a great pop\/blues beat with terrific musical accompaniment, especially the driving harmonica throughout, a true gem.","2335":"The Voice, the choice of song, this is greatness.","2336":"With my limited understanding of Spanish, I had no idea what this song was trying to communicate when I first heard this awesome cancion. Now I know, thanks to the translated I-tunes version.","2337":"Beautiful chorale music!!! I listened and I listened and I listened and I listened and I listened and I danced.","2338":"Great remix of a classic song by Destiny's Child. Energetic and perfect for dancing, running or working out at the gym.","2339":"This guy can sing!! Like the king! True inspiration is only the best inspiration! All Glory to Jesus! If you have not heard my brothers music,.. I would recommend you check it out TONIGHT!","2340":"I LOVE THIS SONG HOWEVER THIS TRACK IS MISSING A 4 MEASURES OF SECOND VERSE AND DOESNT HAVE BRAK MEASURES BETWEEN SECON CHORUS LEADING INTO THE BRIDGE MAYBE IM WRONG MAYBE I TIMED IT WRONG BUT I HIGHLY DOUBT IT.","2341":"great","2342":"This song is another good feeling in dance music.. I remember just having fun like I am right now. You cannot go wrong playing this song over and over","2343":"John Pizzarelli is the quintessential jazz saloon singer.\nThis song has easily understood lyrics from the Cole songbook.\nI can actually sing along with apologies to JP.\nIf you like his music, you will love this song.","2344":"Great song. Unfortunately, Amazon does not sell ducks and the song made me really want to buy one.","2345":"What a mistake!","2346":"Great song","2347":"Will the unreleased (alternate) radio version of \"RUN AWAY,\" which was broadcasted in Chicago and New York, ever be released to the public?  This version was a shortened, yet *enhanced* variation of the \"Club Attack Mix.\"  However,  this version sounded MUCH better than both the Club Attack Mix and Space Invaders mix, which were released to the public.  Please release the other radio version of this song, as it was so much better than all of the other versions!  Please.","2348":"Bought this song so that we had all of the songs we do in this play for children's theater","2349":"I bought it in Vinyl and it;s still great now.","2350":"Track had alot of background noise before the song started","2351":"Sweet Soul Music is one of the most under rated dance albums of 90s. Amazing title track sets the tone followed by a superb \" Was it an illusion\". Had it on audio tape and would love to buy it on CD if the price is reasonable. Perhaps WEA should release the remastered edition of this masterpiece. Alas, London Boys died few years after this album. RIP.","2352":"Came as advertised.","2353":"There was nothing here that was ground breaking, when you pray and you feel the spirit left your prayer request up to God. Really? it's about faith, but if you believe lifting up your hands will do it go for it.","2354":"It was more than I expected and full of wisdom straight from God's word. I highly recommend it for those that want a powerful walk with God.","2355":"Reader, all things in the universe are subject to a bell-curve. Maximiano Cobra is no exception. Even so, to say that he's an outlier is specious. He's at the very first atom of the rim of the bell as it tapers away into the nothingness.\n\nStrange to say, Cobra has one signal triumph to his name.

I would have thought that Bruckner could have survived his onslaught and indeed, flourished in doing so given that his time-space continuum does not differ greatly from the Master of Bayreuth. How wrong I was.\n\nThis is eternity, Jim, but not as we know it.\n\nConsider, if you dare, the timings of his Bruckner Ninth: 47'21\" for the first movement, followed by 18'35\" for the Scherzo and a mind-shredding, soul-destroying 39'08\" for the finale. It's an invitation to go mad or befriend the Kardashians. The subtext was clear: there is no god. In desperation, I rang Hell's hotline in the hope of selling my soul to the Devil for a few shillings. It too, was unmanned. We are alone - alone with the Cobra!\n\nI agree with Klaus Heid. Either this orchestra is computer-generated or Tempus reused the DG's recording equipment from Karajan's 1980 performance of the Alpine Symphony.\n\nReader, you are dust and to dust you shall return. Nothingness seeps into you even as you read these words. Why hasten your demise?","2356":"The orchestra is not real, is virtual. The CD is recorded on a sampled (Vienna Symphonic Library).","2357":"Sacred music seldom found these days! Music reflecting a Holy God. The melody will have you singing in worship all day long!","2358":"Great Product and expedient delivery.","2359":"There's no way to know for certain how these songs were originally performed, but this is such a lovely collection of Renaissance music, I can close my eyes and pretend to be back in the 15th century. If you like early music, give this one a try!","2360":"The singing is uninspiring.  Often the melody is overpowered by the harmony, the singing is clipped and abrupt.  The vibratos of the singers does not allow the chords to tune and \"lock\" in.  I have no idea why the occasional \"whump\" of a bass drum is present.  The christmas songs now have a \"caveman\" feel because of the drum.  Phooeee.  The tempos are too fast and don't give the listener a chance to appreciate the music.  I made a HUGE mistake in getting this cd.  HUGE  I wish I could get my money back.","2361":"Once again, Hogjaw has made some seriously good stuff with Ironwood. The only problem I've been having with Hogjaw is I have not been listening to any of the other 8000 songs from artists of all music genres in my iPod. Like many people, I have wide musical tastes, but Hogjaw's stuff is very addictive. You know when you get hooked on a really really good song, and you can't stop playing it a lot every day, then when it wears out, it wears out? After it wears out, you can't listen to it for some time. Well, with Hogjaw, they have around 15 songs that are lasting way past anything I've experienced in the past and I see no end to jamming them everywhere I go. I also can't really find anything else out there that sounds like them. This is the good stuff man...really good.","2362":"The Ironwood is an extraordinary plant that lives in the Arizona desert in extreme climatic and environmental conditions, a towering plant capable of living up to 1500 years, thus a symbol of unmatched tenacity and power, that we find in Hogjaw's brand new CD, titled Ironwood, from Phoenix (Ariz) and of which I spoke at their debut in 2008.\n\nWith their debut album, Devil in the Details they already made it clear what they were made of, but with this new CD they stormed by force in the Olympus of the renovated and seething Southern Rock movement.\n\nImmediately at first hearing the charge and bullying style of the band strikes hard, with incisive and powerful guitars of Craig Self and Jonboat Jones and melancholy voice and biting of the same Jones, combined with the incessant rhythm of Kwall's drums and Elvis DD on bass, with whom I had a pleasant exchange of emails and I learned him to be of Italian origin as well as a Gulf War veteran.\n\nAs soon as Rollin' Thunder opens you cannot fail to turn up the volume, its charge is a perfect and overwhelming starter to the subsequent Backtop and Three Fifty Seven, which has absolutely breathtaking riffs and scorching solos.\n\nWe find a little pause around the fifth track, County Line with typical old southern melodies and a long and beautiful final solo with an atmosphere reminiscent of the Skynyrd sound, and then resume to the initial power with Ain't ever gonna win until the final Hornsnowgglin that brings us back with our feet on the ground, throwing us in the deep south made of slide guitars and whiskey burnt voices.\n\nA CD that is a real shot of adrenaline with really inspired songs, powerful riffs and fiery solos, but at the same time takes us away in the deep and dusty southwest rediscovering the old melodies of 70' Southern Rock, enriched with a powerful and aggressive sound I like to call Heavy Southern Rock.\n\nA CD not to miss in your Southern record library, but I am convinced that lovers of good music and of the most powerful rock will like this too, a job which I believe is already among the best Southern Rock albums of this 2010.","2363":"The quality is great, and the price was as well.","2364":"Fun!","2365":"Two songs should not be melded as 1 if they are as different as this. Instead,they should do 1 or the other.","2366":"Two songs should not be melded as 1 if they are as completely different as this.","2367":"Don't hate the song (actually very good, typical Thunderbirds) I HATE Amazon's music system. Will NEVER buy music from them again. Stick with ITunes kids. Much better.","2368":"What a fantastic song. I am not a fan of modern country but Keith Urban is so insanely talented. His music isn't really country but it is so much fun to listen to and play. There aren't many new artists I like in any genre but Keith Urban is incredible!","2369":"Great album but first track has a few skips in the digital download.","2370":"HOW COULD MY FAVORITE SITE TO PURCHASE MUSIC NOT PROVIDE A CLEAN VERSION OF THE SONG....HOWEVER I RATE THE SONG A 2..I WOULD GIVE IT A FIVE IF I COULD FIND THE CLEAN VERSION","2371":"Not the real version of the song. It's some stupid low quality techno remix.","2372":"This is my favorite song on the whole CD.\nJulianne's vocal talent really shines.\nAnd the song is catchy...I find myself humming it during the day.\nI recommend it to anyone who loves country ballads.","2373":"Great song it was hard to find thankfully I found it on Amazon.com. Downloading music from this site is easy and affordable","2374":"unless coheed is receiving royalties this is illegal and wrong. I can't believe amazon accepted this. Just shows how easy it is to leech music nowadays.","2375":"This was slightly disappointing for me.  I was expecting a CD to showcase Miri Ben-Ari's style and showmanship, instead I got a CD overpowered by the mixer screaming over the music.  And, you don't get full songs except a few.  Most are just snippets with the mixer giving shout-outs or advertising his own skills.","2376":"This is the fourth studio album of this 10 years old Venezuelan Rockabilly-Punk group. For many people this album is their best effort with a track list as good that someone could think it is a Best Of CD.\nFrom Pop Punk with sing a long choruses, to heavy Rock with very funny lirics and of course: Rockabilly and a small touches of psycho billy and surf.. I recommend  this album with almost 5 stars!; specially if you understand their very good and funny lyrics.\nIf you like this one, buy also a very good new compilation of them, called: Reserva Aeja","2377":"I love Celtic music and I really love The Old Blind Dogs. I highly recommend the album that has this song, Five and also Legacy, Fit, The World's Room and The Gab O Mey. Those are my particular favorites.","2378":"Ya just never know what you will think till you have heard it.  I actually already had a few tracks by these guys","2379":"This a song that reminds me of the beauty of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the beautiful graceful love He has endowed us with.","2380":"absolutely love this song. I love Julie Meyer but Anna Blanc's voice is absolutely beautiful. love love love it","2381":"You Can't go wrong with Vitas. That hauntingly beautiful voice shines through in all 22 songs. I recommend this CD to everyone","2382":"My passion is \"music\".....and becuase I have a european background, I have been exposed to many different styles from many different countries.\nIf you \"bleed\" notes....Then this album is a must. You'll dance, laugh, cry and smile...\nEnjoy!\n\nGEM","2383":"great","2384":"The music is great.  The files SUCK  ... S U C K !!!!!\n\nThis digital download plays ONLY on my computer.  I CAN NOT get it to burn onto a CD to play in my car or my living room stereo. (Yes, both my car unit and my home stereo can play mp3 files and I have played burned mp3 CD's in them before.)

They became quite irritating during the quieter passages. If I could I would return it but unfortunately, it was an mp3 file.","2386":"Wonderful relaxing meditation music.  Use it in my massage business and have had wonderful comments on its relaxational benefits.  Great for personal use and stress relief.","2387":"hot s*** from japan","2388":"I'm not an expert in music, just a christian person that needs to hear uplifting songs, listen to stories that come from the heart. This music makes me feel better after I listen to it. The kids love it too!","2389":"While I have been disappointed by the recent Fabric releases, this one stands out as a replay all the time. It's very different from anything else, and far better than any other mixes I've picked up from the legendary DJ T.","2390":"love this","2391":"Ever since I heard my man Knaladeus (formally known as Knaledge), I was impacted and impressed. Every album he comes out with he elevates to another level. He's pure hip-hop in the realest of the definition and form. I've been working with him for years. And he has even produced beats and engineered on my albums projects. I believe one of my albums he handles the whole album as far as mixing and editing, giving feedback. Radio Friendly is his best work by far. I hope you all buy and LOVE the album!\n\nRicardo Butler aka ReAsOn DiSciPLe the Apostolic Poet","2392":"A menacing avant-garde assault on black music conventions, thick with mean bass lines and creepy late night tales - a young lothario high on the wrong drugs.","2393":"great music,but not what I intended to order.","2394":"Great.  What we do down here is packing up because we don't know the day or the hour, but we want to be ready!!!","2395":"Pretty much every sound you'll need to scratch with. Fresh, ahhs and yeahs are filled thoughout. You'll have lots of fun with this one.","2396":"Great Song.  I love it.","2397":"All the cd's are good bye the Gibson Brothers. Thanks Amazon.","2398":"The Gibson Brothers are a new group to me.  I was very pleased with the music on this album, and am sure if you like this type of music, you would love it.","2399":"I'm not able to play the song on Amazon Music, so I don't know if I like the song or not.","2400":"Love the bass in it","2401":"I was at a dance and heard this song. I loved it right off. Found it on Amazon and bought it.","2402":"If you've never heard Jane Monheit sing; you've missed probably the best song stylist in the business today.  If you have heard Jane Monheit sing, you're probably not reading this review because you already know.","2403":"wonderful harmony","2404":"Strangely enticing music for violin, guitar, and cello, also featuring more distinctively Turkish instruments and light percussion.  It is the ultimate bathtub with a glass of red wine surrounded by candles CD, not that I'm the kind of guy who sits in a bathtub drinking red wine.  As another reviewer noted, it is indeed highly repetitive, but, then, so is a great deal of so-called \"new age\" music (think of Vangelis, for example).  The CD is to be chosen for the quality of its ambiance more than its musical innovation, to be sure.  I am musically disappointed in the fade-out more than the repetition, as this music might easily have come to clean cadences.","2405":"This is a great thing to listen to when you want listen to something great. Especially around this time of year.","2406":"Listening to this, it's hard to believe that only two people are involved.  Very underrated band.","2407":"I love these songs! They teach the children such important things. I grew up listening to these songs! They are the best!","2408":"Colt might have been original at one time, but now hes just a sell out...How far can big boy ride his stereotype pride inducing music on ignorant people...","2409":"Nice","2410":"Nice singing love the music. The guitar playing works very well with the song. His voice is quite unique and beautiful.","2411":"Terrible and it kept skipping it has completely turned me off from ever buying another record online","2412":"mayne, this cd goes off. Man On Fire is better than Tippin Down, but they are both good. I cant get 'Undisputed King Koopa' outta my head. Keep doin wut ur doin.\n\n'The Sound of Revenge' Oct. 25th","2413":"this cd is a tru accomplishment for koopa showing people how its done like the way he diss paulwall on man on fire chamillitary mayne the best rapper ever and lyricist!!!!!","2414":"I don't know why this product ever appeared but it holds the same songs as Alley Cat Stomp  1937-1941 on Krazy Kat KKCD 34.\nSo don't know what to do with it. The Krazy Kat album is still available and I do hate doubles.","2415":"ok","2416":"I have all their releases. They are even better live than on their discs. Great band, and very personable live.","2417":"volume too low on this download. I would choose a different download. Does anyone know if amazon has a return policy on downloads?","2418":"When I bought this mp3 from amazon no where did it say it was the live version ..not what I wanted so I deleted it","2419":"The most important things about songs are the music and the beat.  Next, if someone is going to sing, they need to have a decent sounding voice.  This guy doesn't know how to sing.  He just whines and does a little talk\/singing.  Because there are so many songs in existence, the words are the least important because very few songs have any profound or interesting or amusing statements to make.  He ruins his otherwise slightly above average instrumentation, and provides only a small amount of decent guitar sounds.  First off, he needs to find a singer that can sing and then create some music that is much better than boring.","2420":"Two major problems for an English speaker trying to learn French:\n1.  The phrases are said in French first and then in English and not repeated, so when listening, you have no idea what they are saying in French until after it is said, and then you have no chance to practice saying it.\n2.  Because of the speed at which the words are said, I expected to be able to download and print a script that would allow me to follow along.  I first purchased the mp3 album on my phone so that I can practice anytime.  Now that I have logged on to my amazon site, I see that there is no downloadable script.\nI feel that I will have a very hard time actually learning any French from this $18 \"Beginners\" dictionary.  I would like to return it for a full refund.","2421":"One of Melinda Kirigin-Voss' finest. Her voice is as beautiful as the song. I highly recommend this. Inspirational, meditative and beautiful.","2422":"Live version. Not what I wanted.","2423":"THE GOAT","2424":"The entire mushroom series is extraordinary. I have all of them and always look forward to the next one. DJ Mark Farina knows exactly how to touch those nerve endings developed while listening to and dancing to jazz, funk,and soul in the late 60's and 70's and 80's with fresh new takes that are totally wise to what's going on today.","2425":"This song is one of my favs from Blue October! It is so heartbreaking and hauntingly beautiful! It is an older song that really captures how lost Justin Furstenfeld felt when he was younger and in the middle of his fierce fight with sobriety and mental illness.  Just reAd the beginning of this song and u will fall in love and want more!!!\nI change my color for you.\nI shed my coat with caution.\nI lack the beauty you display.\nSee here they are the bruises.\nSome were self inflicted.\nSome showed up along the way.\nSo I nod my head, I'm ready for the world to see.\nThe secret I kept here inside, the man you thought I'd be.","2426":"Urban Myth Club's second release, I'm relieved to say, is most certainly not a letdown!\n\nThe songs are fresh yet the quality of the first album (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Helium\/dp\/B000EFTENA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Helium<\/a>) is preserved, and, dare I say, surpassed!?\nThe virtual worlds these songs create are richer, more alive than the previous go-around, but each track is just as engaging as Helium's were, and have just as much staying power, if not more. Put one of these songs on repeat for as long as you want, you won't be playing these tunes out any time soon! ;)\n\nI say play this album in the background while spending some quality time with your lover...this one sets a particular mood. *wink, wink*\n\nI'm a bigger fan of the 1st half of this album than the second. For some reason, I find that the 1st set of tracks seem to be catchier and more memorable than the rest. None of the songs are \"bad\" but let's just say I wouldn't be able to identify the title of a track from the second half of the album, if I was given only the first few seconds to listen to. They're still good, but they just never \"stuck\".\n\nMy lineup of favorites are as follows (in chronological order):\n\n1 - Wake Up\n2 - Surrender\n3 - Don't Need To Say It\n4 - Everything's All Right\n5 - Coming Home\n7 - We Have Landed\n\nOf these, We Have Landed is the most provocative. It's a haunting, brooding track that stays with you for a while after hearing it.\nCreepy and sad in all the best ways. I can see this being the opening title track to another James Bond adventure flick. Nice counterpart to So Beautiful.\n\nI would describe Coming Home as a sort of \"sequel\" to Helium's Calling. Likewise, Everything's All Right seems like Open Up's answer to Spacewalk from Helium. That's not to say these are just different arrangements of the same songs. Not at all! They just have a similar kind of tone & tempo...set a similar mood. Another reviewer, writing about the Helium album, PERFECTLY stated how I feel about Everything's All Right when they said it's \"Great to play in the morning when you're just getting into the grind.\" [K. Bowden]\n\nWoke up with a hangover? Throw on that Wake Up track (on low volume, of course). You'll laugh your butt off! (Or you would if it didn't hurt so much to laugh) The guy's voice asserting \"It's a wonderful day!\" - you'll be rolling your eyes thinking \"Yeah ----ing right!!\" XD -- Good stuff!\n\nSurrender is slightly more up-tempo than most of the other songs, with a couple exceptions (more on that later), and is a JOY to listen to!\nThe girl's voice is so PERFECT! I would compare it to The Cardigans' lead in My Favorite Game. Maybe even Ellie Goulding.\nEither way, her voice just has a great tone to it. Hard to describe, but sort of...smoky?...dollish? Anyway, it's awesome! (EDIT: I just realized Bjork's voice most closely matches the girl in Surrender's voice)\n\nBut Don't Need To Say It is by FAAAAAAR my favorite! It's such a cool sound! Lyrically, this song is an extension - if not a carbon copy - of I Feel It; but this is forgivable in my eyes given the amazing quality of the music itself: evocative of the orgy scene music from Eyes Wide Shut, only better, of course! ;) The vocal engineering is stellar! CRAZY-good!!! And not just on the \"twisted\" bits, I mean all throughout. Just a killer sound with some sweet lyrics that'll make you feel all ooey-gooey inside (or warm 'n fuzzy for the old-schoolers)! Gotta love it!! Can't praise that track enough!\n\n---\n\nNow, despite their exclusion from my list, the remaining tracks on this album are most definitely worth a listen! (Heck, I didn't like Spacewalk at all until the day I decided to play the whole Helium album through for a change. Now it goes into every playlist I create!)\n\nI'd say Fragile is the greatest deviation from anything UMC's done. VERY up-tempo! I almost thought my media player had switched to another album when I first heard it! Took me a few listens to warm up to it, as it's more of a Pop song than all the other UMC songs, in this album or the last.\nFriday Night is also quite different, but not as Pop-ish as Fragile. Has sort of a \"YouTube compilation video\" feel to it. But it works, I guess... (again, not a particular fave of mine)\n\n[Note]: There are actually 14 tracks on this album. I'm not sure if an Amazon purchase grants you the 14th (I can't see why it wouldn't, but there's no guarantee), but buying the album (CD or mp3) directly from the UMC site will get you a special download link! :) The last song's pretty high tempo as well, but it's all electronica, zero pop.\n\n---\n\nI know I've made a lot of comparisons between this and the previous album - that this one should really stand on its own, and it does. I just wanted to reassure fans of the original that this is not simply a collection of the same music, nor is it a set of new songs of lesser quality. This is sure to appeal to new and old fans alike!\n\nAll things said, Open Up is a more-than-worthy follow-up to Urban Myth Club's monumental debut. If this trend continues, what comes next is gonna be magic!!","2427":"It skips and I can't play it for my massage music","2428":"Very relaxing and meditative!! Loved it!!","2429":"love it","2430":"I always fast-forward past this song when it appears on the Divine Office. ORG Liturgy of the Hours podcast. I cannot stand the sappy-sweet breathy lovey-dovey cutie pie singing or the treacly instrumentation. The worst part is when the music swells (seemingly in time with the swells of the singer's head) and she sings the bridge. All in all, this is a mere erotic love song that does not once mention God or LORD or Jesus. It is not even thinly-veiled. It is a sorry excuse for a liturgical hymn. This song should not only be removed from the repertoire, it should be destroyed with great prejudice and violence to the master tapes.","2431":"Beautiful music, I just couldn't hear it on my car stereo. I tried my home stereo and it was the same. No sound of recordings. Claimed it and the second was the same. Wouldn't buy it again. So sorry.","2432":"we had to return 2 copies because they were defective.  1st copy didn't play at all, 2nd copy played some of the songs, but not all.  Not sure where to turn to get a CD in good shape.  We've heard some of 'El Magnifico' online and love the music.  In fact, we were hoping to purchase 2 CDs - one for a gift and one for us, but we can't seem to aquire a decent CD.","2433":"First class, Buddy Cole","2434":"Good song","2435":"Great, sweet song to listen to over and over.  I put this at the (cool) end of a dance mix and everybody asked me what it was.","2436":"well I didn't get the whole piece of music. It was only 30secs long. and that certainly isn't the length of the piece. Maybe I did something wrong in the process of downloading?","2437":"This is gorgeously and atmospheric music , beautifully played. Highly recommended, and also available free on a sampler from Amazon.","2438":"Church\/Gregorian chant-like with a light classical guitar in the background. Jordi has a beautiful almost haunting quality to his sound with a deep echo (actually reverb).","2439":"Great music.","2440":"Jordi Saval a master of ancient music, this is a great way to get know this great musician, this music has a way to touch you very deep within, enjoy it.","2441":"this was just simply not my style some of the songs were great but most of them were just not good classical music in my book!!","2442":"just so so","2443":"I've been playing this song since it was out! love the way duane plays it and with the sax its like wow","2444":"This music speaks for itself, amazing mix of rock\/dance\/dj music. Every song has such depth both lyrically and musically. 100% support what this bands about.","2445":"If you like the TV show, you probably love the music.  It really set the tone for the mystery and eeriness of these strange tales.  Whenever the music faded up,  you knew some paranormal thing just happened or that the host, John Newland, was about to steps out of the shadows and tell you how weird it all is.  My only gripe - I wish it was longer.","2446":"A long time ago in the late 70s to the 80s, there were bands with outstanding keyboard players. This is one of those albums. If fact the vocals and mix is really good especially for the era.","2447":"Great unique song","2448":"Used \"search\" to find song using \"...must be the money.\"  This is the wrong song!  The correct song is by Ride with Me; \"...must be the money.\"\nThe correct song did not appear on website!","2449":"Missing many tracks???.....","2450":"Since I only paid $0.01 for this cd (plus shipping) I won't feel too badly when I give it to Goodwill.  I'm not going to go into an in depth critique of the music on this disc; however, I will say that some parts of it are very good, but more than half of it is very bad.  I only listened to this cd once and that was enough.","2451":"The title of this listing is [somewhat] misleading; the actual title of this cd is:\n\nENGLAND - NEW ENGLAND\nRomantic Clarinet Sonatas\n\nIt would be nice if the listing would reflect this; instead of just saying Romantic Clarinet Sonatas. Had I known this I would not have purchased this cd.\n\nThe two star rating is based on two things:\n1. I was disappointed when I received this disc because it wasn't what I was expecting.\n2. I am not much of a fan of this genre of music.\n\nThat being said, if you like this genre of music you may very well give this cd five stars; the quality of the performances and the recording seem very good.\n\nThe works on this cd are:\n\n1-3 David Tovey (1875 - 1940): Sonata for Clarinet and Piano Op. 16\n\n4-6 Daniel Mason (1873 - 1953): Sonata for Clarinet and Piano Op. 14\n\n7-9 York Bowen (1884 - 1969): Sonata for Clarinet and Piano Op. 109\n\nThe performers are:\n\nJohn Denman: Clarinet\n\nPaula Fan: Piano\n\nThe record label is:\n\nBritish Music Label\n\nRecorded in 1986; released in 1992\n\nIt doesn't say if it is AAD, ADD or DDD.\n","2452":"Not impressed with the filler music mixed in with the various meditation music. I wouldn't buy it, that's probably why it was for 99 cents and given to me via brother.","2453":"I am patiently waiting for this album to be released either as a CD or MP3 (Crystal Mansion) in an affordable mass media presentation. The other Crystal Mansion album currently available (The Crystal Mansion - Golden Classics Edition) is good but not this good!!! Someone out there must be able to translate the original timeless album into a modern downloadable digitalized music experience. We are missing a classic early creation of music magic by not having this available.\n\nMarty Swank","2454":"This is the best version of the Song I have heard. Thanks Amazon for making music available, easy and affordable.","2455":"What a surprise - a remastered version which is remastered from a mono version - the mp3 has 2 channels, but they are both identical. The \"Anthology\" LP version is stereo.","2456":"Got to have some KRS-One legendary hip hop artist, teacher and scholar... Not like course in Beyonce, Jay-Z or even Kanye. There are neither the root or the foundation of hip hop.","2457":"To be blunt - this simply isn't Raintime anymore. While on Flies and Lies they put together a masterful album, for this release, they flopped. The growls and sublime aggression in Flies and Lies is history. For Psychochromatic they opted for not just all clean vocals, but weak clean vocals with none of the passion carried in the clean vocals of Flies and Lies.\n\nI've tried to give this album a chance, but it's just horrible. I mean there is still a few good moments musically, but with all the growls, aggression and passion that made Flies and Lies so amazing and unique (not easy in an genre full of carbon copies!), Psychochromatic is but a shell of what Raintime used to be. It has the fingerprints of sellout all over it and the CD is better used as a drink coaster than music entertainment.\n\nHopefully, Raintime will get their heads out of the clouds and get back to what made Flies and Lies one of my favorite CDs and - at the time - made Raintime a potential dominator in the genre.","2458":"I was blown away with Flies and Lies. I listened to it on grooveshark. I was going to get all their albums at one point. Thats what I do is collect albums. However, after listening to this album, I have changed my mind about them. I will continue to listen to Flies and Lies, but I will not be buying their catalog for sure. This album just sucks. I don't normally write bad reviews, but they can do better than this.","2459":"Raintime finally releases a new album and sadly i must say it is very weak. This album has barely anything in common with their previous album \"flies and lies\" the songs are written in a more commercial and less musical way. the melodic death edge is now on 3 or 4 songs tops on this album. They also pull the \"cut down on guitar solos\" thing on this album. That is one of my biggest pet peeves that a band could pull. The guitarist in this band is fantastic, and i find it annoying that he is now only soloing on 2 or 3 songs on their new album. Raintime sound completely different, and im not happy with the change. There are a few very good songs on the album, but I'd say 65% is pretty bad.","2460":"I thought I was getting a Raintime album.  I was sadly mistaken.  Not to imply that this band was original because they surely were not.  But I found things to like in their albums.  This album is a complete deviation from their previous efforts.  Again, another bands sells out their fan base for whatever reason.  I feel like I was duped.  This is one of the reasons why people pirate music.  The previous reviewer is too kind on them.  This is not good.  Not in any shape or form.  Plus this is completely boring.  They have turned into an old school metal outfit with modern rock choruses that you hear on MTV and the radio.  They really don't pull it off well.  Growls???..what growls.  If you liked the other albums from them do not get this one.  It's a disappointment to your senses.","2461":"The audio quality is so shoddy it sounds like it was done on an old cassette recorder. Also, the speaker's accent is distractingly heavy. I couldn't get through this (perhaps it's that discipline I lack). They do an interesting thing of overlapping phrases, however, I suppose to enhance subliminal effects.\n\nReally sub-par.","2462":"I had trouble with the download and never had the opportunity to listen to this, and could not find a way to ask for a \"return.\"  It may be an excellent product, and the best I can say about it at this time is that I lost only 89 cents and an hour or so of trying to make it work.","2463":"Joe Lopez is the face of Tejano music. This cd is amazing, I can't stop listening to it! He did an amazing job on this cd,","2464":"Great album! Dark synth music from Norway, cinematic, completely original, beautiful stuff.\n\nIf you're into early Depeche Mode and Bowie's Berlin stint, or Human League, Fad Gadget, Joy Electric or Kelley Polar (to quote a review in a lifestyle paper here in Norway), this is more than worth having.\n\nGreat artwork by noted painter Christoffer Rdlund.","2465":"Ray Stevens, what more can I say","2466":"Great song","2467":"early maestro.","2468":"I hate this cd very disappointed in Jlo","2469":"This is not a new song .. It's just more Technified A copy of the original version ... ... just look LAMBADA on Youtube ... I admire JL & Pitbull ... do one thing well, such as copying an older version ... I'll stick with the original that caused a stir! in the 80s...","2470":"MAGA","2471":"Why would anyone put this garbage in their ears unless a fascist dictator made them?","2472":"Had Ryan Seacrest played this song at the top of every hour, a month before the election, Hillary would have won in a landslide.","2473":"Awful... Sounds like a lot of tweaks were involved to make it the way it sounds..","2474":"Beautiful lyrics, good music and an awesome voice.  Con Hunley with his blues background is so very very good singing this song.  Enjoying it immensely.","2475":"Lamb of God rocks !","2476":"I really enjoy Con Hunley's voice and Satisfied Mind is one of his best, best is Still written by Bill Anderson.  Awesome singer.  Like the idea of downloading what I really like.","2477":"Heard this song first on You Tube and bought it here on Amazon so I didn't have to hassle with iTunes. I really enjoy Sam's music.","2478":"I ordered some mp3 music from amazon and cannot for the life of me find out to retrieve it. NEVER AGAIN!! This site is WAY unfriendly","2479":"I love Con Hunley music.  He is so talented and I love the soul in his music!","2480":"good song.","2481":"The sounds are just kind of whatever. Recording quality could have been better. Also, you aren't going to be able to use them as they are, and are going to have to layer them or tweak them a bit to make them work for you. Almost all of them fade out at the end. I wish they had just let the laughs die out naturally.","2482":"I have a compilation of speeches from Obama, Hilderbeast and other progressive luminaries.\nI mixed laugh tracks with applause for a very unique and different perspective given the political climate.\nBenghazi was a laugh a minute..","2483":"Great quality, but no rights given, so not useful for content creators.","2484":"Voices are too muffled and the starting and ending points are too abrupt. It's a nightmare trying to edit. Although this was not expensive, it's not worth it.","2485":"Awful. Just awful experience.","2486":"This sound effects pack provides a variety of laugh track recordings to make it less tedious to hear when applying cues for the sitcom effects.  It's pretty helpful.","2487":"This new Blow Up Hollywood disc is a fantastic, diverse mix of music from the band's complete oeuvre. I can't understand why these guys don't receive more recognition. I highly recommend that you purchase a copy now!","2488":"As I stated in an earlier review, I LOVE Con Hunley music!  He sings each song so beautifully!","2489":"I originally purchased this album at a used record store in the late 80's because I liked the cover. There was a short period of time when I stopped listening to vinyl, prefering the convenience of CD's. Unfortunately I sold my copy at a flea market. A few years back I found a copy at a record show and had to have it. If you like to explore the non commercial seldom heard artifacts from the late 60's and early 70's as I do, this is definitely worth a listen.","2490":"Music by Javier Solis my parents use to listen to when I was growing up as a kid. Reminds me of my parents and of my childhood.  Good music. ...... ; )","2491":"A great arrangement of a Charlie Brown song from the little known \"Arbor Day\" special in 1976. Actually, if you find this cartoon on the Internet, you'll find that that the melody is really hard to pick up and moreover its seems not to be one of Vince Guaraldi's better compositions.\n\nWhat George Winston did to Vince's throw away theme (in a largely throw-away attempt to cash in on the glory days of the 1960s Charlie Brown classics) was turn it into a piano masterpiece.\n\nIn fact, am now learning it myself on piano.","2492":"This record is great, I am a fan of Vince Guaraldi Trio's work on the Charlie Brown movies. I just love jazz in general actually. So it is a great cover - kudos George Winston - his covers album of VGT's music is pretty great. He has his own spin\/take and it is really nice to listen too.\n\n*5 stars*","2493":"Not as good as the original, just doesn't sound good.  Get the Vince Guaraldi Trio version instead.  It's much better.","2494":"My favorite interpretation of the Kanon.","2495":"Very good","2496":"This is an awesome song! My kids love it, and I think it is hilarious.","2497":"This music activates you...it's troika of Life, Love, and Liberty will stimulate social justice activists, and I hope, move the complacent among us to \"do something.\" Life's \"War on Us\" reminds us that the \"haves\" have ratcheted their efforts to snatch from us simple comforts that give Americans an OK quality of life and instead, celebrating bandits like Enron's Ken Lay, and Bernie Madoff, and hypocrites such as disgraced public figures Ted Haggard and ex-Governor James McGreevy.  \"Big Money Sonny\" slams BP's response to its mammoth oil spill.\n\nLiberty's \"The Trial of Perry Redd\" weaves a common portrait of criminal justice cahoots and the pro se representation that leads to judicial victory. This \"Land of Mine,\" a collaboration with Dirty Redd, rails against gentrification in USA cities, as well as overseas in Palestine. It's on time.\n\nThe Love pieces celebrate the triumph of romance and commitment. \"Pianos in a Pumpkin Patch\" might remind you of Prince; it'll pique your imagination. The bounce and kick of \"She's My Girl,\" another collab--with DC local BBD--gets you out of your seat. It's my dance fave; and BBD raps a girl to rapture! My fave track is \"One of Us,\" which asks whether we'd recognize God if he\/she\/it walked among us. Hmm. \"Trial by Fire\" is 14 tracks of fresh, innovative songwriting, and continues Perry Redd's vein of social activism...his best work yet.","2498":"Tim Hawkins jokes and parodies are very well done. Entertaining and side-splitting funny. It's a good time had by all no matter what format you see or hear him. His parodies are as good as his original songs. Always worth the money.","2499":"Mostly dumb, not funny","2500":"This song kinda sucks- I was on pandora or grooveshark and heard a song titled the same by Lupe and this was not it. Would not recommend","2501":"just wasn't my thing","2502":"Gaby Dirne stole more songs then anyone else. I could take hm to court for theft of one of my songs.","2503":"I wasn't too impressed with this collection. It was bearable for one car ride and now it's been re-gifted to someone else.","2504":"This is not the Stephen Pearcy' Arcade not even close so don't be fooled do your home work. Steven's band is hard rock and worth buying at leased the first one is. the second one is just OK. I give the first one five stars and give second one three stars.","2505":"There was a error in telephone number. In accordance you report, this product was comeback to the suppliers, in this sense I don't have opinion","2506":"nice jamming, good guitar","2507":"This new release by Vince Hawkins showcases his guitar talents. He obviously favors Hendrix and has a great tone\/sound. He may sound like the great master ,but is not a copy cat. His originals on this cd bring his own sound and songwriting to the forefront. Company Slave has been getting heavy rotation in my cd player and the more I hear it the better it gets. If you are a fan of Jimi or heavy blues rock then pick this up. It has my stamp of approval. Another new find blasting out of the Grooveyard!","2508":"Best album ever!!!  I love Off Kilter and this is their best album by far!!!!","2509":"This CD will not play in my stereo. I have to resort to trying to play it in my worthless Hott CD player that Amazon will not let me review. It skips and stops. Also the piano playing is not on a par with wonderful pianists like Jim Brickman. The playing on this cd sounds mechanical. I am still trying to use it, but will be very careful with what I order in the future.","2510":"Not relaxing enough.","2511":"Not a quality piece","2512":"ex husband hacked into account and ordered them. No idea how it is working.","2513":"ex husband hacked into account and ordered them. No idea how it is working.","2514":"The Odes Project is an incredible work of early Christian hymns.. songs..  worship\/poetry.. put to music .meant for God\/ Spirit focus of His people.

And by that I mean the simple fact that we all know there are a lot of people who listen to this type of music who are turned off at the mere mention of the words \"Christian rock\", which is a shame, a real shame.\n\nBoth their playing abilities and compositional skills are top-notch and I have NO doubt what-so-ever that, if not for the lyrics and label, this band would be playing the mid-level club circuit and have major label backing. Maybe even bigger.\n\nBut respect to them for sticking to their beliefs and not selling out and conforming to what the mainstream wants, simply for more exposure.  I can only hope that more people wake up to their talent and they get the recognition they deserve.\n\nMe, I'll be waiting for their full-length debut and their next concert in my area!","2524":"I absolutely love these guys.  I've followed them for a long time through the Friday Night Coffee House days.  Their songs have intense Christian meanings and will definitely speak to you.  Don't worry, these are not watered down lyrics and even worse watered down instrumentals.  They have a great sound and have a excellent grungy rock edge.  Seen them live many times and they are as real as you and me and they most definitely love the Lord.\n\nCan't wait to see them release a full album.","2525":"I cannot believe amazon.com is selling this illegal CD.

A little bit. Melodic? Definitely. Emotional? Absolutely. It's one of those albums that could end up being a tour-de-force, it's that good. It has many elements of what I like a lot, a little bit of shoegaze and all very smooth. Nice effects, not too electronic sounding but enough to peak the interests of those who are into that.

In any event, the song is unmistakeably evocative of and influenced by Nick Drake, the brilliant but troubled British singer-songwriter who died in 1974. (Drake is probably best known today for the song \"Pink Moon\", used a few years ago in a Volkswagen ad.) Everything about \"Towards the Sun\" recalls Drake: the sleepy, oddly accented vocals, the delicate tune, the deceptively simple lyrics, the rhythmically strummed guitar, and the judicious use of background instrumentals that never threaten to overwhelm Murdoch's voice or guitar. If you've never heard Drake, you may find Murdoch's sound to be a stunning revelation ... or not. If you're a Drake fan, you will probably either be wowed by Murdoch's fidelity to the original or offended by Murdoch's imitation of your idol. Maybe both. Regardless, \"Towards the Sun\" is a good song, and well worth a listen.","2572":"Excellent album. Some great songs, but like any album a few are a bit weak. Overall a great purchase and listen.","2573":"I am a big fan of what I call 'vibe' music. I am not such an afficianado that I can talk about lounge vs. chill vs. ambient and actually know what I am talking about. I defer to the 'expert' reviewers for that. However, I enjoy buying CDs that you can set a mood to. I have my La Perla CDs for chilling out and relaxing. I have my W Hotel CDs for entertaining and errr ... making out to. ha ha It has been my experience that these CDs really do set a good mood for when you are entertaining a member of the fairer sex. Not too romantic that it is sappy, not too slow to put her to sleep and not too fast to make her want to dance.\n\nThere are several great tracks on this CD, but it is all over the place. It starts off with a song that belongs on the runway of a fashion show (or in a strip club) with Goldfrap's 'Lovely to See You'. This song alone is a hot tune, but it sets a pace that the CD cannot keep up with. There is a hard thumping beat song next which is more typical W Hotel Lounge. This is the one you want to put on before you slide next to her on the couch. Or if you are starring in a James Bond style movie trailer. 'I'm a Fire' by Donna Summer comes next, which is too upbeat after the mellow song before it and sounds too much like something you'd hear in an Abercrombie and Fitch store. I worked there for 3 years, I should know. Next comes 'Yangin' by Zarena, which is straight out of a Turkish Bizzare. It almost sounds like a cross between Bollywood and Afghanistan. Doesn't belong on this CD. The worst song, a terrible remix of 'Angel' by Natasha Bettingfield comes next ... this belongs more on a 'High School Graduation '07' CD mix than it does on a W Hotels CD. Skip this. Another miss comes next with 'Wow' by Kylie Menogue. This belongs on a 'Middle School Graduation '07 Mix' CD. Soooo bad.\n\n'Tell me why' is a sexy song with a hard pulsing beat that belongs in the hippest of lounges. Followed by another teenie bopper type of song that will take anyone out of the mood for romance. It sounds like something that belongs in a commercial for a Canadian department store or a low budget generic 'High School Musical' type tv show. \"Shot You Down' by Audio Bully is an interesting and very sexy song that really would be at home in a New Jersey dance club. While I wonder why this was put on the CD, I can't help but think at some point I might have a use for this song. Just when you think the CD couldn't get any more ecclectic and flow any worse 'Dream Catch Me' comes along which is an upbeat EMO style guitar song that could be used as the music in a commercial for Dawson's Creek on the WB. 'As Serious as Your Life' is an odd song comprised mostly of looped beats and a guitar riff. Very Volkswagon Car commercial. Finally, just to prove they could ... they put the remix of the James Bond theme 'You Only Live Twice' by Shirly Bassy. With a heavy bass guitar in the background the classic 70s James Bond song was done wrong and placed at the end of the CD. The lounge and the 70s glitz just don't go together. Its like watching a James Bond movie while having a Jazz Brunch on Sunday.\n\nThis CD is a bit like obscure performance art. It makes you think and ask yourself 'Why would anyone do that?' This is such a mish mash of songs ... most of them bad. I will be taking Track 1, 2, maybe 3, 7, 9 (dont ask me why), and maybe 11 to my IPod. Really though, there are around 3 good songs on here unless your job is to pick the music for car commercials and commercials promoting television shows. In which case this CD would be a goldmine for you. For creating a loungy vibe such as you would find in a W Hotel lobby or bar it doesn't even come close to being decent. It is scitzophrenically bad compared to the usual W Hotel CDs. In fact, I might bring this and leave it in the room instead of taking a CD the next time I stay at a W.","2574":"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ON PURCHASING 'MIGHTY GOOD GOD' CD.  THIS IS THE BEST GOSPEL CD.

Item was a gift for someone else and they were delighted. Loved the gift so much.","2590":"my students hate this they thought someone was jumping up and down on a squeaky bed! So I had to eliminate it from my music library LOL","2591":"One of the most rewarding aspects of writing about music in general and jazz in particular is to discover that Independent diamond in the rough. I love going in cold on a new artist and with the exception of the appearance of guitarist Ron Jackson, I had no clue on Bartlett, Jr. but can now say with confidence that he is easily one of the most talented young players to drop a debut release at for what may considered to be the slightly advanced age of 28.\n\nHopeful is a somewhat conceptualized riff on where Bartlett Jr. views his place in life and the possibilities that lay ahead for his career. An apt title if ever there was one as Hopeful finds a energetic balance between the straight ahead and the modern contemporary without sacrificing either. What is even more impressive is the six of the eight tunes are solid originals and the two covers are the standard \"It Could Happen To You\" and the theme from \"I Love Lucy.\" Granted a television show theme caused a raised eyebrow but the tune has wonderful changes and Bartlett, Jr. turns a shop worn TV theme into a swing tune with surprising energy. \"Quantum Leaps (And Bounds)\" is a blistering romp featuring one of New York's finest if not most under-rated guitarists in Ron Jackson. The high octane tune is an exhilarating romp between Jackson and Bartlett, Jr. as though they have played together for years. The solos and trades are well executed and avoid the potential self indulgent pitfalls that tend to plague some debut recordings. An ability to change dynamics and dial it down is executed with perfection on another Bartlett, Jr. original \"Julia B.\" The thoughtful ballad opens with bassist Eric Lemon who brings another layer of musical flavor and intense lyrical purpose to this finely crafted tune. Emanuel Harold rounds on the rhythm section on drums along with pianist Sharp Radway to keep the ensemble on the straight but swinging path. Charles Bartlett is on trumpet and turns in a solid performance on the standard \"It Could Happen To You.\"\n\nCarl Bartlett, Jr. is the real deal. An instrumentalist with full command of his weapon of choice that being the alto saxophone and showing off mad skills as both a producer and composer, Bartlett Jr. is a legitimate jazz triple threat and a name to keep an eye on. The future of modern jazz is now!\n\nbrent black @criticaljazz","2592":"SUPERB is right!  I have rarely, if ever, heard Sonny Stitt sound like this.  Everybody knows about his instrumental prowess, so let's talk about his sound for a moment.  On this particular album, Stitt's sound is so rich, so full, so visceral, it sounds as if he's gonna pop right out of the speakers and play in your living room right next to you.  I have NEVER heard Sonny play with such a full, enveloping tone as he does here. At first, I thought he might have quit smoking or something, but there he is with holding a cigarette on the cover.  But he must have done something to obtain the lavish, sumptuous timbre he plays with on With the New Yorkers.\n\nAnd speaking of which, the New Yorkers in question (Hank Jones on piano, Wendell Marshall on bass, and Shadow Wilson on drums) support Stitt with aplomb here, never getting in the way, but playing more than we are accustomed to from rhythm sections on Sonny's Roost albums).  Hank Jones plays several fine solos throughout, and comps well behind Stitt's solos.  And what solos they are!  Sonny, in addition to sounding better than usual tonally, is very much inspired throughout this disc.  Maybe he ate his Wheaties the morning of this session.  I mean, he usually sounds good, but he has never, to my knowledge, sounded THIS good. I'm talking in terms of tone, power and timbre. What a transparent, beautiful sound!\n\nWhen I noticed that there were no reviews for this album, I knew I had to review it!  There are well over one hundred Stitt albums recorded and some of them are bound to get lost in the shuffle.  So I considered it my civic duty to turn people on to this album, so I could tell the  world (assuming that Amazon RR readers represent the world) the this is an astonishing record that you shouldn't miss.  Please note that I am reviewed the Fresh Sounds vinyl reissue here, and the pressing is excellent.  If you only need one Stitt album in your jazz collection, you can't possibly do better than choosing Sonny Stitt and the New Yorkers (uh, doesn't he play with \"New Yorkers\" on all his albums?).\n\nAnyway, BUY IT!","2593":"Took significantly longer than I'd have liked to arrive. But the CD came in PERFECT condition, a real rarity these days. And the performances are treasurable, whether one is a fan of Gould, Mitropoulos or even Schoenberg.

True, he did produce several classic singles for the Ronettes, Crystals and Righteous Brothers that are some of the most beloved Oldies from the 60s, but he was not on par with someone like Paul McCartney or John Lennon who could craft entire concept albums that remain classics 50-plus years later.\n\nI am not bashing Phil nor his music, just using my above statement to back up my two-star review for this CD that is only worth getting for HES A REBEL, DA DOO RON RON and THEN HE KISSED ME. The other songs on here are nowhere near as good as the three hits. Its too bad that the Crystals didn't have better material, but I feel a little of Phils sound went a long wayit only worked with the right melodies and lyrics, and the rest of whats here is lacking. I fell in love with the Crystals hits back in the early 80s and actually liked them better than the Shirelles or the Chiffons back then. But Ive heard a few of the Shirelles albums recorded in the 60s and even the deep album cuts are much better than the second-string hits found here by The Crystals. The sound quality on this CD isn't the best either. Sorry, cant recommend this.","2626":"Ranks as one of the great girl groups of the 60's.

It lacks Julie's exquisite intimacy, sensualism and sophisticated arrangements of her earlier albums. There is honestly not one memorable cut on this album. In fact by the horribly hokey rendition of Never On Sunday.. I was actually slightly insulted.\n\nI'm the author of the book Lady Liberty: The Definitive Julie London Handbook available on Amazon.  As a jazz pianist and vocalist myself who had met Julie London and Bobby Troup as well as performed with several Julie's musicians including Al Viola. Julie called this album herself \"shlock\".  She was forced by contract to mold to current bubble gum pop tastes and started to move further away from the winning concept formula of her earlier cool jazz and bluesy albums.  Also terribly disappointing was the horrific album cover that pencil sketched and not Julie's usually gorgeous photo, there were no liner notes for this album too. It was horrible package haphazardly thrown together. Though she does convincingly give a little tongue in cheek on \"Come On a My House\" ...... but not if this mediocre album is playing.

I just don't care ofr any of these.  I recommend the remixes to Till The World Ends, they are all awesome!","2638":"The Jump Smokers Remix is awesome BUT they edited out the part of the song that says \"IT'S BRITNEY B!TCH!\" I'm pretty disappointed since that is the part of the original remix that unifies the track and helps build momentum right before the MASSIVE Jump Smokers beat hits!!! Instead, the track leaves you with a moment of silence that in my opinion completely disrupts the overall flow of the song. I'm almost positive iTunes offers the same LAME edited track. NO BUENO!!!","2639":"good resource","2640":"I generally like Ravel and thought to try this piece.  It is some sort of operetta or something.  I don't like it at all.  Not sure whether the blame goes to the performers or if it is just not a very inspired composition, but listening is not enjoyable.","2641":"I have listened to a cover of this song for years, but did not know who did it originally.

But finally there is a rock album worth the title of \"ROCK ALBUM\"! In the past 15 years, rock music has degenerated into derivative displays of musical bravado. Instead of allowing the music to stand on its own and focus on creating fun, entertaining, rock & roll music, bands tried too hard to differentiate and experiment needlessly. And when one band or song got \"popular\", hundreds of copycats filtered through the airwaves resulting in the watered down guitar pop that you hear on the radio today.\n\nThis album is a non-apologetic, dirty, sexy, joyride! It's what rock USED to be like! No whining, mopey, \"woah-is-me\" crap! No cutesy engineering magic! This album goes back to rock's roots and reminds you what made rock great!\n\nIf you like the old school rock bands where FUN was the order of the day, you'll love this album It is just fun, in-your-face rock!

They don't have any of the correct emphasis within the music itself. It is almost like it you had a computer write the music.

My idea is that these players (and composer) are not really fans, but are trying to make a buck.","2669":"I was very disappointed and immediately looked to see if there was a way to return this.

Wish they would offer me a refund seeing how they got me for both!","2682":"Sadly, this is NOT the musice from the show Sing-off. The groups don't sound the same, and the biggest give away, is that the show was centered on acapella music, and this is not acapella.

Sartor is truly a gifted, talented musician.  A must have.","2685":"This song is not edited if that's what you want don't buy this version. I just wasted my money on this.","2686":"Avril Lavigne has built a full career off of being an angry little pistol of a woman.  You can come away from a lot of her songs, if you're a guy, feeling you just got kicked in the shin (even while enjoying the music).  \"Smile\" is a wholly different departure for Avril.  You still get a dose of the Angry Canadian skatergurl, but you also get the feeling that this is more hopeful song.  Avril seems to be bouncing along, energetically, singing about the positive way her significant other makes her feel.  It's nice to get this happier version of Avril, while she still remains true to her punk roots.","2687":"bad language on this version too. don't buy\nmislabeled  Bad-Bad. wasted my money and not happy as the\npreview does not play the bad words? how do i know its clean!","2688":"My 9 year old and 6 year old girls really love Avrils singing. The songs are fun & uplifting. The problem is they can only listen to half of the album because the other half has to many inappropriate words (CURSE WORDS) in the songs. It is really unfortunate especially on a song like \"Smile\" that has good intentions. Can you make a \"radio friendly\" version of the entire album?!?!\nAvril, I am not asking you to lose your \"edgy\" side either, just make a radio friendly version with no cussing! Oh and guess what Avril, that would bring a whole new audience to your music and that means MORE $$$$$ in your pocket! What a concept!","2689":"This version is not the radio version.  They have removed one word, \"Fu****g\".  They half-heartedly removed \"S**t\" but left the \"Sh\" sound in so there is not much left to the imagination.  And as the previous reviewer mentioned, the word \"b**ch\" is used not once, not twice, but three times.  The version played on the radio replaces this with \"chick\" and has no \"sh\" slur.\n\nImagine unknowingly downloading this for your 13-year old.\n\nAmazon, I realize that this is a play by the artist's label (RCA) to uphold Ms. Lavigne's \"Bad Girl\" reputation.  However, everything I've ever purchased on Amazon upholds your brand of honesty and integrity.  I recently switched to Amazon to purchase all of my music because I got fed up with The Apple Store.  Unfortunately, RCA pulled one over on you, and you have passively passed it on to the consumer.  Please find a way to exchange the \"radio version\" you sold me for the \"radio version\" that is really played on the radio.  You have the pull.  I'd like to know that in the future I can trust you more than I can Apple.  A brand is nothing more than a promise of value, and today you broke your promise.","2690":"Classic. I downloaded it to ensure a good quality sound for an 80's themed meeting soundtrack. I just cannot believe that my Director of Operations had never heard this.. only the Marcia Griffiths original.

I will definately buy more songs through here","2693":"Megaforce was a terrible 'B' action movie, it's only redeeming quality was the Title song. Yet it is 'stupidly' fun. The acting was infantesimal, costumes laughable, vehicles....ultra cool. I loved it !","2694":"The \"Leave it to Beaver\" theme song had several versions over the years. Disappointingly, this version is not the one that has the very pretty upward scaling violin line near the end of the song. When someone decides to do a theme song, they should do their research and choose the most intricate version of the song, not the shortest and most simple; otherwise, why bother?","2695":"Ordered it by accident, not my type of music. I never heard her before now. Might check out other songs but don't think it will lead to purchases","2696":"I don't know who the jerk that plays this piece is, but he needs more practice, so he can play like Biggs.  Not worth your money.","2697":"not the original version I grew up with sounds like a re-record. it's a shame  I wasted my free download","2698":"It's not a full song so bad you sell stuff like this","2699":"This is not the track I purchased. I was listening to pandora clicked buy, and this is the track that it downloaded - bummer","2700":"This is the fourth time now that the song I wanted was not the one I bought.

This album is a really great album. it has his first recorded songs way back before his voice changed deeper. you can still tell its him by the style if his rapping. I gave it 4 stars because they added songs that were already out on his other albums. other then that, this is a diamond in the rough that every project pat fan should have.","2704":"I like Jackie Jackson'a songs","2705":"i LOVE this album. however, amazon specifically states this album is Explicit and then has nearly all the songs cleaned. 1 star until fixed.","2706":"I love Ghibli. But, I also love Jazz. So, as renditions of Hashishi songs, I like them. But as a jazz album it's really terrible. Very little imagination. Classifying this as Jazz reduces Jazz to pure cliche.","2707":"As a long time lover of Delius' music, I was keen on hearing this new disc, particularly as it contains the first recording of \"A Poem of Life and Love\", parts of which were later recast (with the help of Eric Fenby) into \"A Song of Summer\". I approached this recording with some trepidation, however, as I've found David Lloyd-Jones to be a problematic conductor, whose interpretations are often characterized by a lack of clear focus as well as rhythmic slackness. Unfortunately, my fears were  justified in this instance.\n\nAt 17 minutes, \"A Poem of Life and Love\" is quite a substantial work. It provides fascinating listening, although the sections which were to be later salvaged are all the more conspicuous for their superior musical quality. Much of the rest of the work is second rate at best, with a principal theme sounding like something from Delius' student years. Fenby was entirely accurate in his negative estimation of it (as tellingly recreated in Ken Russell's film), and hearing the original conception makes one appreciate and admire \"A Song of Summer\" all the more.\n\nThe \"Irmelin\" Suite (as arranged by Beecham from Delius' early opera) is pleasant enough, although Delius'\/Fenby's later \"Irmelin\" Prelude has more genuine musical quality and interest in its five minutes than in this fifteen-minute compilation.\n\nI've always found \"Life's Dance\" to be a problematic work. It predates \"Paris\" (1899) by a year (though it was revised later), and indulges in some of the same Straussian orchestral virtuosity. However, after an impressively energetic opening and a  gloriously lyrical secondary theme, the piece degenerates into a short-breathed and often rhythmically monotonous central section, which cannot be rescued by a return to the opening and a final climax. To barrel through the tedious central portion, as Lloyd-Jones does here, doesn't help matters either, as instrumental detail gets muddied and\/or lost in the shuffle. I don't find that any of the earlier recordings by Groves(EMI) Del Mar(Unicorn) or Holten(Danacord) are successful either, though Del Mar comes closest to making this piece work.\n\nThe suite from \"A Village Romeo and Juliet\" is David Matthews' revision of his own earlier(1987) version, written at the request of, and recorded by Carl Davis with the London Philharmonic(Virgin). In this revision, the concluding \"Walk to the Paradise Garden\" is replaced with the actual final music of the opera. Given the comparative familiarity of \"Paradise Garden\" I can see the reason for the revision, although I found the original version of this suite to be musically more convincing, as the \"Paradise Garden actually follows the Berghald  Fair scene in the opera, and the transition is Delius' own. Carl Davis' recording of the original version is also much more musically alive as well as better played and recorded. Matthews' new transition to the final scene is a bit awkward in my opinion, as are all of his other transitions, but the idea of a symphonic synthesis from VRJ is a good one. I could imagine a more extended (30-35 minute) suite including both the \"Paradise Garden\" and the wonderful dream music from scene 4.\n\nAs I said at the outset, I often find Lloyd-Jones' conducting to be problematic, and this disc is no exception. Granted, the RSNO is not a first class ensemble, but under conductors such as Jarvi or Gibson the orchestra can sound more than respectable. On this recording, however, balances are uniformly bad, with coarse, strident brass and weak upper-register strings, problems which are not helped by the garish quality of the recording itself. Overall ensemble is ragged to the point that this whole recording sounds like an under-rehearsed rush job. The only real reason for acquiring this disc is for the \"Poem\". The asking price by these Amazon sellers is outrageous; I would direct anyone interested in acquiring this recording to prestoclassical.co.uk, where I obtained it for $15.\n\n.","2708":"Good choices but it's not the original radio recordings. There should be a law to mark this clearly.","2709":"Disappointing re-mix of an epic song. The tempo of the re-mix is a poor fit for the song's pacing, was hoping for more. I do not recommend this purchase.","2710":"I've always loved this song, it is an oldie but a goodie!  It tells a story, part of history, maybe embelished a bit but it is fun :)  My young kids love it.","2711":"Purchased this one while at work (in a local high school) so the kids could hear it for the first time.","2712":"A VERY POOR MODIFICATION OF THE ORIGINAL...REALLY BAD !","2713":"This is not the original version of 96 Tears. This version is hard to listen to if you know the original. If you want the real version you should buy it off of the album \"The Best Of ? & The Mysterians\"","2714":"What kind of ego could someone have that they think they could take a wonderful song by Switchfoot and make it better? This is an electronic nightmare...six minutes of sheer torture! I want my money back!","2715":"None actually as I didn't mean to order it and could not return it.","2716":"This song is very deep & could really wake people up to the truth of the world. There where days I feel like showing this to my teachers. Please spread this song around. People really need to here it, & its a really dope song like crazy. Really no other words for this incredible Master Piece.","2717":"Lupe fiasco fan like he's music another song I like to listen to when I'm working out.","2718":"From the cover, one would assume that John Gatti's \"Destinations\" is a solo album, but is it? Each track sounds like a band made up of piano, keyboards, percussion, and a wide variety of other instruments and voices, but no other artist credits are given. That only leaves one explanation - that John Gatti is a one-man band. Further exploration of the liner reveals that this is the case. Wow! How does one jazz musician keep the music so loose and free yet completely in synch? The only answer to that question is pure artistry, and it's truly amazing. \"Destinations\" is comprised of thirteen original compositions inspired by places Gatti and his wife have visited over the years, and the music spins a mood of joy and unbridled fun. From funky jazz to steel drums to Latin stylings and more, the album provides more than an hour of great music. I listened to it four times in succession while driving from the SF Bay Area to the Oregon Coast the other day and absolutely loved it with the volume cranked up and my sunroof wide open.\n\n\"Destinations\" begins with \"Cotton Candy,\" a funky piece with a great beat and laid-back style. Inspired by a vendor at Yankee Stadium, piano, percussion, voices, and guitar provide the perfect groove to get this set started. \"Watermelon Summer\" conveys the easy spirit of getting away for some time by the ocean. If you can keep still while listening to \"Old San Juan,\" you'd better check your pulse! A high-energy piece with a spicy Latin flavor, I love this one!  \"Cast Away\" takes us to the Caribbean and the joyful sound of steel drums. \"Jet-Glider\" has a more synthesized sound and ambient feeling, suggesting the wonder of falling water, air, sky, and freedom. \"Saltimboca\" is a lively piano and percussion tribute to New Orleans - another piece that makes it impossible to sit still - also a favorite. \"Struttin' Around Pines Lake\" brings back some easy funk and synth scat singing (how'd he do that?) backed by a strong drum beat, organ, and bass guitar. \"Tomorrow's Showers,\" for Seattle, WA, is a slow groove for piano, percussion, and synth - very soothing and relaxed. \"Cooling Down\" (San Francisco) is the epitome of West Coast Cool (although it was composed for Joyce Cooling and her husband). Piano, percussion, bass, and synth washes make this an easy-going and addictive gem. \"Pepe's Dancing Feet\" (Atlanta, GA) brings the album to a close with a celebration of good friends, good food, and fun. It just doesn't get any better than this!\n\n\"Destinations\" is a fantastic album to lift the spirit and to celebrate life. I expect it to be one of my favorites for the year. Very highly recommended!","2719":"Wasn't the song I wanted. They had it set up wrong I thought I purchased another song because that's the way they had it,but when I had purchased it I found out it was the wrong song. Not very happy with the Amazon mp3","2720":"Very powerful!","2721":"The sexiest C.D of all time. I had to re buy this C.D 3 times because I played the hell out of it.","2722":"Definately nothing new and truly a regression from my standpoint.  I think your were alot more appealing and had a fresh perspective in your previous offerings. I really can't elaborate much more because nothing on the CD particularly grab me it was just so so Bobby.  But I think you should look for better writers with offer different perspectives on the issues in which you address in your songs which will allow you to project your range and make heads turn when they first when listenin, for instance like Usher on There goes my baby.  Many people didn't think it was him because he hit that note, but long-time Usher fans knew from You got it bad.  So regroup and we look for your next new and improved Bobby V.","2723":"Okay","2724":"I had not been a fan until recently and this is the only song that he has that I've listened to or owned but it is nice.","2725":"This song is actually NOT the same as the sample played. I'm very disappointed.","2726":"Kind of a routine, if not mundane, \"ditty\" for Ry Cooder who can be superb. Don't know how I got it - ' must have been digital bounce.","2727":"Great song off zero dark thirty trailer.","2728":"There is so much to want to like about this set.  A full live recording of Demons and Wizards, a great collection of past hits and a nice sampling of new material.  The music itself is well played and the group really sounds in fine shape.  Unfortunately, the sound quality is mediocre.  It sounds like it was recorded in mono and is really compressed; much like an MP3 file.  So don't expect wonderful sonics this time; which is unfortunate since the music is so good.","2729":"I guess I have been spoilt by \"The Legend Continues\" & \"Magic Night\". This one does not compare, if you are looking for the same polish these other recordings carry. Love the sellection of songs with the exception of the more recent tracks, Angels walk with you and Shadow. I am surprised that these are in the set, when there are so many other classic songs to pick from. I was particularly looking forward to Overload. While Mick's guitar work in this is spot on, it lacks punch. A lot of the backing and harmony vocal is pretty average. There are sections where some of the instruments seem to fade out. There is a desperate need for some mixing here. Overall Burnies vocal work is very good, however, he does have the occassional flat spot. I am probably a little critical. I am sure if this were re-mixed it would come out sounding great. For a bootleg it's not bad but I would probably recommend saving your money and spending it on the other live recordings.","2730":"Love It!!! An amazing song..such beauty..","2731":"The music of Ib Nrholm (b. 1931) is quite well represented on disc, and Kontrapunkt seems to have championed it with some enthusiasm. The disc at hand appeared to me to be a representative samples; maybe it is, maybe it isn't, but at least it provides no impetus to explore his output further. Nrholm's style is a little hard to pin down; whereas the symphonic fantasy Hearing Andersen and the suite The Shadow are dissonant, expressionist but essentially (neo-)romantic and accessible the fifth symphony is rather forbiddingly dense and uncompromising.\n\nHearing Andersen is derived from music from a Danish TV production of H.C. Andersen's The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep. It is at least variegated, combining Tchaikovsky-like rhapsodizing with modern-sounding effects. It is also completely without any discernible structure or any redeeming qualities - music hardly comes less inspired or interesting than this, and it adds up to a rather painfully boring 27 minutes. Shadow sounds like a surreal take on late romanticism and impressionism, and although that may sound prima facie appealing I can assure you that there is nothing appealing about the results. In short, these two works are as dreary, hollow and uninspired as music comes.\n\nThings improve somewhat with the symphony, which is a darkly pugnacious fantasy of flittering shadows. It is far less accessible than the other works - in fact, it adopts an uncompromisingly dodecaphonic idiom, but at least there are some modestly interesting ideas in it. Overall, however, it is about as inspired as its inspiration (the four elements - air, earth, fire, water) would suggest. I have no objections to the performances, which are technically adept and full-blooded (although one sometimes gets the impression that the players and conductors are thinking \"why on earth am I playing this\" just as much as the listener is wondering \"why on earth am I listening to this\"). The sound is generally fine if sometimes a little constricted. In sum, the symphony may be of some interest to the specialist; the rest is drivel.","2732":"I enjoyed this song very much.","2733":"It sounds worse than 'Death Magnetic.'  Really.\n\nAnd that's a shame because there's good songs here, good musicianship, and so forth.  But there's really not much point in listening to it because it's so blatantly distorted that it ruins the listening experience.  Truly, it sounds like they made a proper recording, and then ran the whole signal through a Boss distortion pedal to make it loud.\n\nAs I said: a shame.","2734":"As always sara evans hits it right on. I really like this particular song. Gonna have to shop for more.","2735":"The Tunics previous album, Somewhere In Somebody's Heart, was very fast and kitchy. Each song was perfectly crafted and mesmerized the listener with the great beats and meaningful lyrics.\n\nDabbler's Handbook is still classic Tunics, however it is less upbeat and is a more mature sounding album. Just as their last one, Dabbler's Handbook is one of those CD's you just pop in a listen all the way through. The songs grow on you.\n\nOver-all it is a great album and I am happy to have found it. I still enjoy there first album more, however Dabbler's Handbook is also quite an enjoyable listen.","2736":"Nice easy listening tune","2737":"This orchestration is SUPERB !!  I play it every morning just to start the day.\nOf course, I was familiar with Chopin's work, but Richter's touch lifts it to an\neven more enjoyable level.  If you are wanting to give a friend a whale of an\nemotional boost......this is IT !!!","2738":"I wrote to Lotus personally and they said they know nothing of this release. Their response was...\"Not a Lotus album. Unless there is another band named Lotus\"","2739":"I love it!","2740":"So, this was obviously one of his best.

I found this version and bought it without listening to it, big mistake.\n\nThe music was distorted from the very beginning and completely unusable.","2743":"Though not well-known, Hobo Jim is Alaska's favorite troubadour.  This song pays tribute to Joe Redington, founder of the commemorative Iditarod sled dog race, held annually the first weekend in March.  The course, which runs from Anchorage to Nome is one of the last great races on the planet and is a test of human endurance and will to succeed.  Redington's sons and grandsons still run the race; he is an icon and a hero to Alaskans.  Hobo Joe's songs, many of which he writes himself, are based his own experiences as a fisherman, logger, and miner, eking out a living as many Alaskans have always done.  He is cut from the same cloth as other folk artists who have put our culture to music over the years.  Though not prolific, he has a number of albums out, all of which I highly recommend.","2744":"Its not bad, parts are better than a whole.  I don't think most of it will stand up to repeated listening.","2745":"I had this vinyl when i was a teen and i had to get the greatess vinyl all time 1965","2746":"It's a good song and I love Glee music and the show is cool with talented people in it. I hope they don't end it yet and not end it badly.","2747":"I always love hearing this song. Can listen to it over and over. Whoever did the lyrics did a great job.","2748":"Haka chant was hard to hear and understand.

To be quite honest it sounded very much like an old Vinyl LP, with 'scratches' and interference in most of the songs.\n\nI will not provide any feedback on the artists who have given a wonderful performance, suffice to say they were all excellent.\n\nI had to play \"Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye\", sung by Claudine Longet, a number of times, to appreciate her voice and the sensitive and subtle way she sings. In the end I felt she gave an excellent rendition of the song.\n\nI have no idea why the following artists were chosen, as there are other artists who would have provided a more enjoyable experience:\n1. Linda Thompson did nothing for the \"Story Of Isaac\" and produced a very lacklustre rendition.\n2. Eyeless In Gaza (sang \"Priests\") who I have not heard of were, to say the least, grating on my ears. Think of the sound you make when you scratch a blackboard with your nails; that pretty much says it all.\n3. Susanna And The Magical Orchestra (sang \"Hallelujah\"); refer to my comments for \"2.\" above, plus I see no magic in the singing at all!!!\n4. Phil Campbell (song \"Take This Longing\") gave a somewhat lacklustre performance.\n5. I will provide feedback on The Handsome Family and Mr. David Viner as there is only two words for both, absolute rubbish.\n\nI would be interested to hear what others thought of the CD, or am I the only one who has purchased it?","2750":"I discovered Anne Harris playing her incredible music in a local venue and was immediately entranced.  I bought her album worried that her incredible stage presence might have fooled me into thinking that her music was better than it actually was.  I had nothing to worry about!  Anne's music is an incredible blend of influences, with intelligent lyrics, catchy, memorable melodies that pull from her Irish and African heritage, as well, it seems, every place she has ever been to or read about.  Her incredible music has enough depth and variety that I find myself listening to both her recordings over and over and over again!","2751":"Inexpensive way to enjoy goth\/industrial from some unknown underrated bands.","2752":"I liked this product because the music is fun and I would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of music.","2753":"I heard this piece live on Easter Sunday played on the pipe organ at Christ Church Cathedral in St. Louis as the postlude after the service.  When the organist began the piece, people who were exiting the church simply stopped in their tracks to listen.  The sparkling staccato phrases dancing above a deliberately ponderous pedal part echoed throughout the Cathedral.  The piece was just magnificent.  Unfortunately, the brilliance and assertiveness of this piece is lost in this performance.  It is played too fast, with too little emphasis on the commanding passages of the music.  It reminded me of a lackluster recital piece, rather than something you would expect from a grand pipe organ in a Cathedral.  Much better is the Michael Pohl CD Organ Symphony No. 5 in F Minor, Op. 42\/1: V. Toccata.  This is available on Amazon.  Avoid the Downes recording.","2754":"eh","2755":"Great!!","2756":"I got his last mix tape with where you going Mr Peanut on it. Bout to cop this one. I think 50 signed him because he can tell that Kidd wrote Lil Waynes raps when Guille stopped. I would like to see Nut and Guillie the Kid get the props that they due. So all in all this is a pretty good album from a formerly unsigned NOLA rap Vet. Big ups Kidd 9th ward Rida Gang Ha nicca! Its a shame that the true talent does not get exposed and insteand you associate most of his hottest songs with garbage lil Weezy. Like Ms Officer was a KID thang, and Neck of the Woods was a Guille joint.\n\nI remember when a rap style was like a finger print. When you opend your mouth to spit from the first bar you could tell yea thats a Pac verse or you tryin to sound to much like 2Pac or Spice 1. Kinda like when everybody said BG stole his style from Magnolia Slim. Even BG had to mention it in one of his older songs. Point is Nut does not sound like nobody else except the few instances where he sounds like Lil Wayne, but I guess so because he wrote a lot of lil Wayne verses. Rap has been murdered and drowned in hype, but at least Nut is staying real ya dig. Big ups. Bring Rap Back like the Eddie Bow.","2757":"not quite the exact version i was looking for, but this ones great as well","2758":"I have not listened to the full CD yet and already have found three tracks with junk at the end after the piece should have ended.  Don't waste your money\/time on this one!","2759":"Mailley-Smith specializes in Romantic repertoire, which he plays most deliciously, sometimes a little flamboyantly, always Romantically. It's hard not to like his pianistic technique, although some listeners may find it too fanciful, too dramatic, too ostentatious; too much playing to the audience, if you will. Certainly, no one can accuse him of not being virtuosic, though. He is a most-skilled practitioner of the art, with the kind of poetic style that may seem old fashioned in an age of clarifying, analyzing, and elucidating every note. It seems to me that the best pianists--Pollini, Ashkenazy, Perahia, Argerich, Brendel, Kovacevich, Rubinstein, Gilels, Richter, Michelangeli, Janis, et al--generally combine the two approaches. We'll see how Mailley-Smith proceeds in his career, and whether he can equal what only a handful of pianists have already accomplished.\n\nThat said, there's a lot to like here.\n\nMailley-Smith opens the program with the Fantasie Impromptu No. 4, Op. 66, an excerpt from which you can hear below. The track pretty much exemplifies everything the man does on the disc. It's lush and it's plush, and it will blow your house down. Not that it's slow or lackadaisical, however; indeed, it is fleet and surefooted. It's just that Mailley-Smith so caresses each note, it sounds as though he's making love to the instrument (a Steinway model D). This is not only Romantic piano playing, this is a romance between the performer and the music. It's quite hypnotic, actually.\n\nAnd so it goes through fourteen items on the disc, each one played in a smooth, flowing, polished, yet thoroughly engaging manner. Mailley-Smith performs with flourish and sensitivity, pointing up every ornate contrast the composer has to offer.\n\nWith the exception of just a few items, the numbers on the album duplicate the program presented on pianist Idil Biret's very fine collection of favorites for Naxos. So, I had a good comparison there without having to dive into five or six different CD collections of nocturnes, waltzes, etudes, etc. And what I can say is that Mailley-Smith acquits himself very well next to his older compatriot, matching Ms. Biret in virtuosity and sensitivity and surpassing Naxos's slightly clearer but edgier sound. While it is still open to question whether Mailley-Smith will ever match Pollini or Rubinstein in Chopin, we shall see, but he's off to a promising start.\n\nThe Nocturne No. 2 in D flat, Op. 27 is as creamy and dreamy as anyone could wish for. The Etude No. 8 in F major, Op. 10, nicknamed \"Sunshine,\" is all bright light and sunny skies. The famous Prelude No. 15, Op. 28, \"Raindrop,\" exudes the sort of beauty you want, with a wholly appropriate gentleness of touch. The \"Minute Waltz\" comes through with flying colors, and sounds less breathless by the end than we sometimes hear it. Then, there's a degree of melancholic dignity in the Waltz No. 2 in C sharp minor, Op. 64 that's refreshing.\n\nInterestingly, both Mailley-Smith and Biret open and close their programs with the same two selections, the aforementioned \"Fantasie\" Impromptu and the Ballade No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23. Just as interesting is Mailley-Smith's inclusion of the Souvenir de Paganini, a delightful little set of variations one doesn't often encounter. It rounds out a program that quite won me over. Mailley-Smith provides the kind of Romantic expressiveness that makes him a crowd pleaser.\n\nIf I have any minor argument with the disc, it's that it provides less than an hour (55'05) of content. Surely, the pianist has other favorites he could have included, or was it a matter of cost considerations in recording? I don't know, and it's a small matter in any case.\n\nGood, realistic piano sound, too.\n\nJohn J. Puccio\nClassical Candor","2760":"I bought this to hear a LIVE performance of Gerard Souzay's Golaud having long treasured his studio recording with De Los Angeles. The recording is advertised as being on one disc. I thought that it must be an MP3 and it was dirt cheap. As it turns out , it is a CD and only contains the first half of the opera. I enjoyed what I heard. Not \"one for the ages\" but good. Souzay was as excellent live as on  studio recording. I also liked the tenor Tappy as Pelleas. Spoorenberg is a known commodity and sings the role on an Ansermet recording. Sound was OK for a live performance of this age. But who really wants only HALF of a Pelleas??","2761":"A great disappointment. The package came with no cd","2762":"This CD repertoire  is more mellow than marshmellow and even Mr. Most was not able to extract his long time ability to set new moods to old standards.","2763":"I have only been a Trust Company fan since 2012 when I started listening to True Parallels. I also listened to The Lonely Position of Neutral, too. I really enjoyed both albums, but this one runs circles around the other ones. There is literally not a bad track on this entire album. This album kicks butt from start to finish with a ton of energy and solid lyrics. The sign of a good album is when you can listen to the songs over and over again and never get bored of them, I have listened to this album multiple times over and over again and I am still amazed at how good this album is. If you are looking for a phenomenal rock album, I highly recommend picking this guy up. You won't regret it. This is Trust Company at their absolute best.","2764":"A truly beautiful Hawaiian song with a perfect melody.","2765":"Anotherr great song from my favorite artist.","2766":"I've always loved the smooth sound of Kem. His voice is one that I can listen to all day and especially at night.","2767":"I was looking for another recording of this song besides Hapa's and this was the first to come up on amazon search so I bought it.  I listen to this at least once a day.  I may check out the rest of the album too.","2768":"Barrett's Privateers is a standard in the field.  Written and performed by the late Stan Rogers, it is a classic.  Supposedly, there are bars in Newfoundland where if you can sing a verse of this, you get a free beer, or ale, or something.","2769":"Good but not as good as i thoight it would be.","2770":"Some artists fall into a rut; they find a niche and stick with it. Megan Slankard is not that type of artist. With \"A Token of the Wreckage\", Megan's four release and third full-length production, she has evolved and is finally hitting her stride. From a young girl with a guitar, she developed the ability to fully orchestrate a song with nothing but her own hands and voice, but even that was too limiting for this artist. Now with a stable backing band of Danny Blau on rhythm guitar and keyboards, Kyle Caprista on percussion and backing vocals, James Deprato on lead guitar and bay area stalwart Jeff Symonds laying down solid bass lines Megan has the ability to fully realize the orchestration she hears in her head.\n\nMany songs found on \"Token\" have been part of her live repertoire for three or more years, making them sound effortless even when wrapped in lilting guitars, complex harmonies and solid percussion while Megan's voice floats above. The overall effect is well engineered, if slightly restrained in comparison to a live performance.\n\nFor the Megan fan, \"Token\" represents a satisfying meal after a six year famine and those new to this artist will find it an excellent introduction.","2771":"This long awaited fourth offering from Megan Slankard is her best yet. Soaring vocals, though provoking lyrics, and stunning musical compositions. One of the best female singer \/ songwriters ever. No collection is complete without this album.","2772":"I got this to use to relax.  I play it at my desk when I am on my computer.  Very relaxing.","2773":"I do like much New Agey kind of music. Sorry, tried the sample button & ran thru the first 6 before it got to me totally on wrong side.  Wondered which side of reviews I'd fall on.\nMaybe if used in an active Yoga class\/session it could be useful. For standalone background music while doing brain tasks, nope.  Way too clanky.  Bells & flutes just so heavy handed when in the flow.  Annoying for sure.\n\nThanks for the freebie tho. True fans should enjoy.  Hopefully something like this length & variety will be offered with a more general Agey atmosphere.","2774":"Great song","2775":"This song is actually titled \"One Of Us\" and was originally written by Eric Bazilian (Hooters fame) and covered by Joan Osborn in her album Relish. For Osborn's version, Eric Bazilian backs her up with his own vocal input, as well as playing electrical piano and guitar. It's a song about faith and your belief in God. Bazilian is quoted as having said the song was written to \"impress a girl\". He says this was a success because they both \"married and had two kids\"---how's that for the power of music for ya? This track is an 'okay' version but I don't like that they gave it the wrong title. Be respectful to the original artist, please!","2776":"This is not the Firehouse it looks like. This is some type of obscure variation on the use of the name \"Firehouse\" as a band name. Don't know where it came from or when but it is not Leverty's band, and that is definately not Snare singing unless it was recording when he was fifteen or something. There is no record of this album ever being recorded by or associated with the band most notably known as \"Firehose\", regardless of the font on the cover.","2777":"Though I have not heard all of the Firehouse albums after Firehouse 3, I would still think this would have to be the worst ever. The music sounds like its from the 70s including rediculous keyboard solos. If you're wanting something that sounds like their first two albums, DO NOT waste your money. Also, I gave it 1 star rating because a no star rating wasn't possible.","2778":"Very moving piece of music. It brought back fond memories of the movie Platoon. I don't think I have ever heard such haunting music before.","2779":"These are all re-records!  If you're looking for the original Chubby Checker recordings from the early 60's, go find the ABKCO Records Cameo Parkway Best of Chubby Checker CD","2780":"It didn't seem to be like original Chubby Checker tracks and the sound quality was not as I expected. In fact I was very disappointed.","2781":"I purchased this from the MP3 store because the short bit on the clip sounded lovely. The tempo, key, background instruments,  the singer's voice, the arrangements, all are gorgeous and if she could pronounce the words it would be one of the best of the versions of Hallelujah. The problem is this lady does not speak a word of English and she destroys the lyrics with her exaggerated mispronunciations. It would have been beautiful sung in her native language instead since she can't pronounce the English words and I would have given it rave reviews if she had performed it that way. I am sorry I purchased this MP3. Even though I know this song's lyrics like the back of my hand I could not discern what this singer was singing most of the time and that made it too distracting to listen too. There are much, much better productions of this song.","2782":"MURASKO is a modern day troubadour who writes songs that have meaning and sensibility. His music runs the gamut from hard-edged rock to pop and even a little bluegrass thrown in. His lyrics tell stories of personal experiences that all of us can relate to, sung with passion and from the heart.  MURASKO sings and plays all of the instruments on the CD, except drums. He also produced it himself. The songs that I recommend are \"Sitting on a Mountain\", \"The Beach Tune\", and \"Starting Life\", but they are all excellent.  MURASKO'S drummer livens up the music with creative aplomb and good taste.  MURASKO is an exciting new performer who you will not be disappointed in. \"Lost in Razzi Berry Field\" is an exciting musical journey.\nI was \"Sitting On A Mountain\" and \"Lost In Razzi Berry Field\". The day was hot, a real \"Baker\". While I was listening to \"The Beach Tune\" on \"KRVA\" and looking at \"Soaring Horizons\", a \"Freedom Fighter\" roared across the sky. It was as if I had just \"Woken From A Dream\" and just \"Starting Life\". Then I realized it was time to get back to the city. How I'll \"Hate\" to see those \"Glass Giants\" again.","2783":"nice sound","2784":"I saw this guy perform on the Africa channel and loved his music, rhythms and his time signatures, but his voice is just atrocious.  Sorry, I have to say it, may not be a popular thing to say, but I gotta do it.  If you can overlook the singing check out his album and you should enjoy it.","2785":"Classic Skids done right! Lzzy Rules!","2786":"I was remastered using other artist. I was disappointed. So if you looking for original singer make sure you type in George Harrison then look for title.","2787":"This song was the song that got me into Panic!. I first saw it in a video my sister showed me and liked it so I bought it. I'd recommend getting the whole album, however.","2788":"usually i pefer studio over live, but Green Day always sounds good no matter what type situation they are in","2789":"I first heard Amon Tobin on Pandora and in-turn went and got a bunch of his albums. The tracks are very hit-and-miss for my taste. None of it is bad quality, it was that I would love listening to 1\/3 - 1\/2 of the songs, the other ones I pretty-well leave off my playlists. But THIS album (just purchased and listened through a few times) has well-above the \"love\" ratio of the other albums. This will likely be my favorite full albums of his. Doesn't contain my favorite individual-track(s) like The Killer's Vanilla, but totally an album to put on, in its entirety, and do work (SON!). Such skill this one has.","2790":"Love this song.","2791":"Nice cover of Temple-Lzzy Rules!","2792":"This soundtrack feels big and powerful, but at the same time haunting and divine.  If you found yourself loving the music in the game like I did, you'll love this soundtrack.","2793":"This EP shows how diverse Halestorm  is as a band! From the Beatles, to GNR & Lady GaGa. the bands musicianship and Lizzy's wailing vocals shine! And as much as I like this EP, Reanimate 2 and 3 are just as good! Covering Joan Jett, Soundgarden & Sophie B. Hawkins to name a few.","2794":"Eskmo does not fit everyone's view of electronic and vocal mixtures, but I like his approach to a variety of topics, styles and rhythm.\nCertainly, the hip-hop uses more of what he does, but it's not meant to be, \"in your face, mother f\"\nSorry, I like his style and the music more than the shouting and noise of others.","2795":"This is not the original version of Younger Girl by the Critters. I'm sorry I downloaded it. That sums it up.","2796":"A","2797":"not very good...okay.","2798":"Great","2799":"It was accidentally purchased.  Amazon was great and refunded the purchase.  I didn't care for the song.  Afterwards, I purchased the correct song.","2800":"I like to play it super loud in my car and see the faces of people on red lights, they don't expect me to drive super fast after listening to my song lol","2801":"CPE Bach sounds nothing like his father, Johann Sebastian, but more like Haydn. Actually, he represents the link between the Baroque and Classical periods. These pieces are typical of his work, lively and fully orchestrated. They are well played and extraordinarily well recorded. Highly recommended.","2802":"Don't get me wrong: the musicians are of prime quality, the repertoire is well chosen and I'd really whished to enjoy this CD. The single star goes entirely for the musicians, and I hope I can get the original CD someday. However, there are too many problems with this product.\n\n1. This is a recorded CD-R, which is less durable than an pressed CD. Yes, Amazon warns about that. What they don't tell you is that what you get is nothing more then a CD with a tracklist. No booklet, no texts, no artist photos -- nothing. In the MP3 version (available at amazon.de as well as the original pressed CD) you can at least have some extra information from the tags in the files. Here you get nothing: if you don't search the internet for a picture of the back cover, you can't even know who composed each piece. What you get here, for the price of a full CD, is only a wax color low resolution single sheet with the track names on it, as if you printed it from a directory listing. The least expected was a high-res reproduction of the original CD covers, front and back, as weel as the booklet. Instead, you can't even figure out who composed each piece and which tracks constitute the pieces. If you do not get a booklet, what is the purpose of buying the CD instead of the digital version?\n\n2. The artists in this recording are or prime grandeur, so I cannot imagine the distortions I hear all over the tracks are the product of a bad sound engineering. This must have something to do with this new recorded-on-demand process. Track 24 is a complete messs, with the high frequency of the violins and harpsichord screaming over the solo and ruining the otherwise great performance. This is not worth the 16 USD I payed for the CD. I'd rather pay the 22 EUR they charge at amazon.de than have a crippled copy comparable only to a low quality pirate CD.\n\nIf all the CDs produced on demand are like this one, Amazon is in trouble. Since I only listened to this CD after returning to Brazil, I will not bother returning this item, but I hope this review serves as a warning to other buyers. Buy the original CD, not this crippled fake. The performance is very good, and the musicians deserve their praise. Unlike Amazon, for selling such a bad product, unworthy of their usual high quality standards.","2803":"Listen to it every day and sing in my car with every song! awesome!","2804":"Good item. Five stars.","2805":"A lot of money and next to impossible to install well.","2806":"Why did I choose this rating, because I have to download the Amazon Downloader to get my music.  And when bandwidth is at a premium in Kabul, this infuriates me.  I occasional forget this and buy music from Amazon.  After my blood-pressure comes back down, I remember why I quit buying mp3 from Amazon and go several months until I forget again.  I hope Amazon eventually learns, if you don't force me to use your proprietary app, I might not get so upset with Amazon.  I will not ever give any other evaluation than something along these lines, enjoy Amazon.","2807":"IMPOSSIBLE TO DOWNLOAD","2808":"Dizzy is amazing.  He was a great master who obviously hD a great time doing what he loved.","2809":"Love it excellent.","2810":"Just a beautiful song and so reflective of that time!","2811":"So what if they were more than a little campy with their Revolutionary War get ups and the tricornered hats.  It is still a catchy song.","2812":"You can't go wrong with this sexy, and entertaining classic. Purchase This Year's Santa Baby to keep the fun going.","2813":"Cutting edge and common sence.\nSo practical and life changing one thought at a time.","2814":"Been jammin' ever since I downloaded it!","2815":"Every time I listen to Loose Ends, it takes me back how 1980's R&B whether from the States or the UK, felt so pure and simply JAMMIN'! Love this band and their music!","2816":"Garbage...","2817":"These are garbage covers. My fault for falling for this one. I should have known that the price was too good to be true.","2818":"Certainly not the voice of Richard Burton.","2819":"There is music on here running over the words. This is not mentioned in the product description. Incomprehensible. A waste of money.","2820":"It was not like the original that I expected. Seems like the music was too loud in the background. Be careful which version you order.","2821":"I have never heard a more out of tune and sync knockoff since the early midi era...  Seriously, these are crap.","2822":"You can probably tell that this MP3 only contains short little bits of John Williams's fantastic movie scores just from the running times of each individual tune. Unfortunately, these are all strung together, like a medley, and the sound quality is very poor, sounding as though it is all played on synthesizer. (Not that I know whether or not it is, that's just how it sounds to me.) All in all, a very poor product, not worth the price.","2823":"Excellent!!!","2824":"Last Chance To Reason level 2 album is just incredible hard, fast, loud and much much more this album is off the wall good.\n\nRecommend to anyone","2825":"I purchased this mp3 album after seeing it on sale for five dollars and having good reviews, comparing them to between the buried. HOWEVER, I made the mistake of looking up the lyrics, AND THEY WERE SO BANAL and retarded, they literally ruined every single song. Repetition of the same word was all any song ever was now to me (much like meshuggah is just crash cymbal after cymbal after cymbal ad nauseum), I couldn't avoid hearing anything else; a misconception about the workings of technology (even allowing some poetic license it's still absurd and just wrong).\n\nI originally thought the band members originated out of the states, I was gonna be kind, say it's a language gap... but no, they're from Maine. Inexcusable drivel. I now dislike this album more knowing that.\n\nAnd, if I recall, the comparison to BtBaM is understandable, but I feel this is much more stripped of anything interesting, not enough to keep listening. You know what the next track's going to sound like after the first. Hell, you know what the rest of the CD is going to sound like.\n\nI want my money back  =(","2826":"Great","2827":"just plain wow. Some of the songs on this are so intricate and detailed. An incredible cd. They are the best German metal band in my opinion. And a few of the guitar solos are insane. The speed of some of this stuff is great. Very happy with this new cd","2828":"The riffs are top notch, the solos will blow your mind, and the styles of Death Metal incorporated in the album are somewhat varied.","2829":"Jinnean has an incredible voice, I love it and that's the reason I bought this cd. Unfortunately the tunes are very uneventful, dull and do not do her justice. Not only that, but they're embarrassingly not contemporary. I love Gospel, but singing \"I kissed a girl and I didn't like it\" to keep the young generation chaste, is absurd and even more so dangerous. Man and woman are made to unite, so why not teach the kids about chivalry, about the beautiful and perfect design of mother nature? In a day where insecurity leads to corruption of ideals, where violence, rage and homosexuality are rampant DON'T TAKE AWAY A STRAIGHT KISS, it's the most beautiful and magic thing we have, if done with the right heart. This experiment failed, it didn't empower me, it is full of redundancy and lacks courage.","2830":"I really enjoy this recording of Vivalid's \"Four Seasons\" by Eugene Ormandy conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra. I feel that it is wonderfully expressive (some other renditions lack emotion or are too stiff) and perfectly timed (some other renditions play it waaaay too fast and others slow down at times when I feel it is inappropriate), all while never being overly gratuitous with the music (some other renditions really go to town on the solos). I've listened to a few other versions, and this is the one I have stuck with.\n\n[P.S. I heard the \"Seasons\" by Eugene Ormandy \/ Philadelphia Orchestra on another disc prior to finding this one. On the remainder of this disc there are some other tracks, aside from \"The Four Seasons\". I have not listened to these yet, so I cannot vouch for those.]","2831":"If you are wanting a fast song, this is a song for you. I recommend this song to anyone! :)","2832":"Which just so happens to suck for Rihanna.  Which is why I gave this song one star.  I refuse to give any kudos to a self loathing woman hater.","2833":"This is not the version of the song from the movie, but it is the best quality you'll get of anything like that version. It's close enough, but for something saying it's of the Savannah Smiles soundtrack, it's a real shame they didn't add the original version to the soundtrack, and it was a small disappointment. I just went ahead and converted my copy of the movie with that portion into an mp3. Hey, I technically already paid for it here, right?","2834":"Trae (Tha Truth) has always been one of my favorite rappers to come out of Houston, TX. He has been around a long time, and in my opinion, is way over due for his time to shine. If it hasn't been one thing then it has been another. Always humble, and doing great things for others, Trae is one person who deserves to shine. Earlier this year, 97.9 Tha Box (radio station in Houston) put a ban on Trae's music and even went so far as to fire some of their own personnel for associating with him. They claim that Trae's music glorifies violence and is better left off of the radio. Trae responds with this powerful mixtape, letting it be known that he won't stand for that kind of bs. Support REAL Hip-Hop: Buy this, give it a genuine listen and you will almost be compelled to scream, \"F*** 97.9,\" for what they are doing to Trae. Like I said, this mixtape stirs up emotions that you just don't find in Hip-Hop nowadays. Trae Tha Truth forever.\n\n5\/5","2835":"This was a free song and wasn't worth the money I spent.  The artist, Gretchen Parlato drifts off key repeatedly.  The song itself is uninspiring and aimless.","2836":"1","2837":"Awesome.","2838":"Good lyrics.....BUT unless you can get your church to memorize a chapter of scripture in under 5 min don't bother with it.  I go to a SGM church and it is really hard to sing along to.  Unless you play this in your ipod 24\/7 (including when you sleep).  Ohh and SGM is still stuck in 1990....Maybe 1995 at best...They just realized that Cold Play existed and tried to copy it on the best of there songs.  Good luck.","2839":"I became acquainted with Sovereign Grace Music two years ago at -Worship God-, a worship conference that they host. I was overwhelmed by the depth of the lyrics and the music that gave it breath. Unfortunately in my opinion -Risen- though sound theologically, is horrible musically.\nIt's not that these songs aren't singable, it's just that they aren't good musically. I plan on attending -Worship God- this year, and hope to find the live versions\/tweaking to be a little less boring.\n\nMaybe I need to digest this album more, but as it stands there is no All I Have is Christ, The Fathers Love, Completely Done, I Will Glory in My Redeemer, or Jesus Thank You on this album.\nI really hope that SG figures out where they went wrong here, maybe overproducing\/too much micromanaging and not enough freedom for the songwriters? Just a guess...","2840":"Kind of disappointing, the Amazon download for this song is cut off in the middle of the song (the length is currently 1:06, just for reference in case they fix it).\n\nOther than the download sucking, the song itself is awesome. Heard it on Last.fm and came here to buy it.","2841":"I heard this song in the movie \"Apart.\" While the movie was just alright, this song stuck with me and I felt the need to purchase it. It's slow paced, melancholic, and at times seems to struggle with continuing to play which makes its fragility all the more alluring.","2842":"Natalie Merchant is always a good listen!!!","2843":"Great Voice","2844":"No good was not in English  you get no stars","2845":"I don't know what I was thinking. Just because I like one Chris Brown song I sampled this and accidently hit purchase. I've learned my lesson. I will never even think about sampling anything unless I know more about the quality of the artist's work.","2846":"Because we are so human, we so often try everything before we finally bring our problems\/worries\/failures to God.  Even as Christians we seem to forget that the cross was for us.","2847":"iTS EXCELLENT MUSIC.  I LIKE BECAUSE ITS CHRISTIAN MUSIC AND MARCOS VIDAL IS ONE OF MY PREFERENCE. I RECOMEND IT BEACAUSE WE NEED TO BE NEAR TO OUR GOOD.","2848":"Beautiful song wonderful music I listen to it all the time I'm excited to see what else he comes out with so I can buy them too.","2849":"I like Renaissance music, and have listened to many works or pieces in this category.  This album says \"The 99 Most Essential Renaissance Masterpiceces\".  I totally disagree.  This compilation has Medieval music (eg. Cantigas, Oswald von Wolkenstein, Landini) and early Baroque (eg. Monteverdi).  More surprisingly, I found many unfamiliar pieces.  I had never heard of these pieces such as Georg Bhm, Melchior Borchgrevinck ...  It is a good chance to know these pieces. However, be careful.  I don't think these are the essential Renaissance masterpieces.  This album lacks early Renaissance music especially early English (eg. Dunstable, Eton choirbook, Tallis), Burgundian school (eg, Dufay) , many important Flemish school compmosers and pieces (too many!), and Iberian composers (Tomas Luis de Victoria, Milan).\n\nOverall, it has lots of fan, but not a good overview of so-called \"Renaissance music\", particularly for beginners.","2850":"Being one to the Amer\\Idol contestants and having a voice for this kind of music, I would highly recommend this song and just about any other song he sings.","2851":"Kirk @ his finest! He always speaks to ur  : )","2852":"I feel like its only me and God when I listen to this.  Absolutely beautiful.  Mali's voice is so Angelic. I love it!!! I love the fact that Mali and Kirk love Jesus so much. I love him so much too!!! God bless them both.","2853":"YES AND YES","2854":"An awesome song to remind you that no matter what you are going through- GOD IS GOOD","2855":"I know CB asked fans to help his album sales. With songs like this, and collabo's with Awesome artist such as these, I, for one, will continue to support CB. Love the song...I've actually used the hook in referring to my ex. Download the song mannn. Deuces...","2856":"This song gets you where you need to be. I will just say that. I bought it because I like Chris Brown and I was not disappointed with this song.","2857":"I like the fact that you can preview songs prior to buying.","2858":"Like many people, my first encounter with the 'music' of this young man followed a conviction for violence against a woman. Little surprise then, that this album if packed full of explicit references and veiled pornographic imagery - yet aimed squarely at kids and teenagers. The song 'wet the bed' is downright appalling.  A sad indictment of the current state of the music industry that the worlds most famous record label RCA, allowed this to be released.\n\nIn June 2010, Chris Brown's application for a visa to enter the UK was refused on the grounds of him \"being guilty of a serious criminal offence\". This followed criminal convictions that included a violent assault on a female pop star. Brown got lucky and was sentenced to five years of probation, one year of domestic violence counselling, and six months of community service; the judge retained a five-year restraining order on Brown, which requires him to remain 50 yards away from [the victim] Rihanna, 10 yards at public events.\n\nIt is with the above publicity that I learn about this 'singer' and I spend several hours sampling the album - trying to find out what the fascination is.\n\nThis individual sounds like a third rate karaoke version of a young Michael Jackson. This is 'painting by numbers' music. The tracks sound like they are straight off a studio factory assembly line. Unimaginative and repetitive references to 'make you love me' and 'i'm gonna do x,y,z to you' this is not music I would allow children to come within a mile of.\n\nMore mature artists perform this genre with a level of authenticity. This just sounds very young & amateurish.\n\nThe track 'Next To You' proves that Brown has some singing ability. How edited the track is, I do not know, but he can clearly sing. It only proves how utterly murky the whole situation is. Underneath the anger, the violence, the bad influences, there is probably a talented young man. Possibly, but I doubt there is enough talent to save this sorry character from a further life of crime.","2859":"Great classic! Remember the Chrismases of yesterday.","2860":"It's Good Audio ,I Like The Album , I Would Buy This Album In Stores Any were . Chris Brown Is Of My Favorite Artist","2861":"AWESOME","2862":"Amazing Voice, guitarist, very mellow  . . . who is Bradley Self ?  The world needs more of his wonderful songs \/ music!!!\n\nLove & Happiness\n\nEmily","2863":"Another excellent work by Thomas Dolby.

All MC fans must have this. 20 years later and their still grooving.","2870":"Awesome fun song! Good to exercise to as well again must say I love Amazon because it offers clean versions of songs","2871":"Isn't anybody going to comment on the fact that \"Yeah Yeah Yeah\" is unoriginal? Anybody ever heard of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs???!","2872":"Does not ring true. Guy sings like a Joe Crocker clone. Voice and tempo does not fit the subject.","2873":"I had never heard Imelda May, she is authentic.  You can't get much more authentic that Brian Setzer dueling with Jeff Beck on \"Twenty Flight Rock!\"\n\nI think that those of you who are not familiar with Les Paul and Mary Ford's pioneering effors in the '50s will be surprised at how close those efforts came to Rock'n'roll as we know it now.\n\nGet this sucker and buy some beer and kick back, this is real American music.","2874":"Can't get enough of this song...Elan Trotman's sax sounds and Tony Terry's voice are a perfect blend.  Perfect song for your \"kicking off the day\" playlist or to ease into the evening with.","2875":"this cat can write some cool songs","2876":"The disc I ordered was exactly what I expected.  Strange Streets is a rare disc and I'm glad I found it.","2877":"This band was played on the air in the Central Texas area thanks to the Godfather of Rock on 99.5 KMAC and KISS from San Antonio, Texas.\nIt was great listening to it and other types of rock music!\nNothing like the junk music being played today!\nTry and listen to some of the early 70's jams and tell me if you don't agree?","2878":"I have been listening to Curtis Fuller since first hearing him on the legendary John Coltrane album Blue Train. He has always been an innovator and a trombonist's trombone player. He is also a wonderful composer and arranger. This recording lacks everything I have grown accustomed to when hearing Mr. Fuller and I am astounded it was even released. The piano is out of tune, the sound quality and mixing are amateurish and the playing is substandard throughout. The heads are misplayed and so are many of the chord changes. It makes me ask, did they actually have the charts or were they playing from memory? I cannot believe Curtis Fuller had anything to do with this recording and I doubt he knew they were recording his stories for release. I adore his 2010 release, \"I Will Tell Her\" which was also dedicated to his late wife Cathy. Before buying this CD or MP3s, please find a way to hear it first. A lot of music critiques are a matter of opinion and some listeners may like this recording. Anyone with an ear for jazz will (or should) run shrieking from the room upon hearing this horrible CD. My sincere apologies to Curtis Fuller for my comments but the producer of this recording should get another job and should be banned from doing further damage to great musicians' careers.","2879":"Okay","2880":"I love this song.  It has a home on my MP3, computer and phone.  It soothes my heart, its so comforting to me.","2881":"So love this CD!!!! I know anyone who purchases it will be blessed!","2882":"You can't help but to do a Good Old Holy Dance when you hear this medley, so go on and Get Yo Praise On!!","2883":"I was very disappointed. I was under the impression it was a duet.","2884":"I was unable to download this for some strange reason. But I was still charged for it. I called tech support but they were unable to detect the issue.","2885":"There are perhaps two or three Catholic hymns inadvertently included amongst this Protestant collection,  Some, like \"In the Garden\", are actually in conflict with Catholic theology.  Farjeon's \"Morning has Broken\" is a lovely Anglican hymn that then became a pop song (by a singer who then became a Muslim).  Martin Luther, who wrote \"A Mighty Fortress\", is not exactly a Catholic saint.  I don't know what, or if, they were thinking when they named this album.","2886":"Short sections of the hymns, usually a minute or less, no lyrics.  Very disappointed.","2887":"These instrumental renderings are perfect for quiet meditation. Unobstrusive and peaceful, redolent of all you remember of your early faith.","2888":"I was hoping to see things like \"Oh Lord I am not Worthy\"... and others, but \"Morning has Broken\"?  This isn't religious at all--it's a secular song written by a man who converted to some other religion. It's a pretty song--but by no stretch of the imagination is it a \"Catholic\" song.  \"A Mighty Fortress is Our God\"  was Martin Luther's battle cry AGAINST Catholics.  Okay--- so if you're strictly looking for nice \"Church\" music... the songs are that... nice.  But to claim these as Catholic Hymns is misleading. Also it's all piano music which can be quite soothing--nothing personal here; but I was really surprised to see so many non-Catholic selections among the list.","2889":"You can't beat the value for the album.  Lots of Catholic favorites too.  Just be mindful that it is only piano music.  I've made it part of my sleep setting on my alarm, it's wonderful for that.","2890":"Great song","2891":"I would love to give this a 5 star rating if I could find it on my computer. I bought it, want the music because I love he song, but do  not know where it is \"saved\".","2892":"This is a very beautiful melody that Damone only enhances with his smooth baritone voice. You'll want to put this one on your ipod.","2893":"He is just a solid songwriter. This is no exception. Love his various songs.","2894":"This is an awesome single by an awesome artist","2895":"Jason is bell is the real deal. This song is spectacular! He's been at it for years and it shows.","2896":"The singer\/songwriter known as Chop Chop doesn't expand her sound on this release. It's self-involved, bedroom electronic indie pop. Whatever merit the songs have is ruined by the poor production and amateur singing. A couple tracks might sound like early New Order if they had decent production...but they don't.","2897":"didn't like the CD ended up giving the video to my Church.","2898":"If you are looking for classic JW blues or blues rock then look elsewhere.  This is a collection of oldies with the sound of the 50s.  It's ok if you are into that music.  For me, it puts me to sleep, and I was born in the 50s.  Listen to almost any of his other albums if you want to hear one of the greatest guitarists that ever lived.","2899":"who wants to buy this when there is no list of songs","2900":"Great song, good beat and talkin bout what us redneck do on the weekend, hell yeah! Would highly recommend this song","2901":"Will only play on my cheap boombox, not my two expensive CD players.  Very disappointed about this.  The Cd music is lovely and I only wish I could listen to it on my quality players.","2902":"ALWAYS MY FAVORITE. LONG LIVE THE KING!","2903":"Bad quality sound","2904":"Classic song.......I wish I was a better reviewer and then I would post more!!","2905":"annointed","2906":"A \"Space\" like feel to nature sounds CD. Dueter is unique and known for this in his field. Very electronic. Youtube him first, and give him a listen too. If you like it, buy it here.","2907":"loved the ease of buying and downloading!","2908":"I listened to this because Jeff Daniel's character was singing it in episode 1, season 2 of The Newsroom.  No wasted lines in that brilliant show, so I looked it up.  Brilliantly snide.\nSo here's my review of the song:  oh my gosh!  friday comes after thursday?  and saturday comes after friday?  who knew?  pretty much the definition of vacuous.  (look it up.  if you listen to this song, you'll probably have to look that word up.)  and the chord sequence is just about as sophisticated as the lyrics are (and her voice is very nasal - not fair to all those amazing vocalists out there).  how does such crap (i started to say mediocrity, but that would be 2-3 stars) get promoted?\nThis is why it's so funny in The Newsroom.  love that show!  Five stars for that one.\n\nRead more: Rebecca Black - Friday Lyrics | MetroLyrics","2909":"This track is so offensive and downright disrespectful to REAL artists.","2910":"My husband bought this because he is a jerk!","2911":"To prove myself a man, I forced myself in front of a computer and forced myself to watch Friday. After multiple attempts which resulted in me turning it off in less than 14 seconds, with side effects being gagging, choking, and moaning, I final set my teeth and forced my eyes to the screen.\n\nThis is quite possibly the worst thing ever made by man. Rebecca Black cannot sing. She opens her mouth and out comes noise. This is a tune that will haunt your sleeping hours...and your waking ones. The music video is equally abysmal, showing all the artistic talent of a young, hyperactive teen's first foray into television.\n\nThis song should come with a disclaimer. Listen to it in public and you invite yourself to heroic bystanders coming to the aid of the general public and tackling you to the ground. Listen to it in private and you subject yourself to seizures, headaches, and temporary memory loss.\n\nAnybody who listens to Friday and likes it, should have -- NEEDS to have -- the back of the head swatted repeatedly and remorselessly. Do it for their sake.","2912":"My seven year old wanted me to download this. Awful music, repetitive and dull lyrics.\nGood thing it was free.","2913":"Attention kids or Teens do not listen to this cause it may cause the following symptoms shown below\n\n1. Irritation\n2. Hearing loss\n3. Sucidal Thoughts\n\nThis is for real because this is  the WORST song i have ever heard in my whole life. The senseless autotune the corny songwriting and just the feeling that you regret spending 99 cents on this ABOMINATION. This should not even be called\nmusic it should becould doo-sick","2914":"Just love this song. Haven't heard it before this in years","2915":"Very relaxing, although I was looking for more owl noises and without the music.  It does \"put\" me back into the woods, though, and reminds me of nights we camped.","2916":"I don't remember how I came across this band, but made the mistake of buying both releases without doing much investigation. I gave both albums a couple listens before deciding they just weren't worthy of taking up space on my iPod.","2917":"Nobody is greater that JESUS CHRIST!!!!!!!!","2918":"Usher what more can I say","2919":"old time good song","2920":"Great music","2921":"Rather than endorse true love, friendship, and peace, the concepts in this song directs people into short term and long term pain, unhappiness, and real sorrow.  The ideal depicted in this song is seeking to fill an emptiness, a void, that only grows bigger the more they are used.  It is like running a car on empty while racing to get fuel by driving away from the fuel station, being so close to getting what is needed but going the wrong direction because of the anxiety of the urgent need, creating total chaos and ultimate failure.  I feel such sorrow for the lunacy of the logic that fuels my friend.","2922":"Voice of an ANGEL, lol. But also Angel Olsen's voice is enchanting.","2923":"Still one of my favorite male vocalists! He knows how to pick the right song for his abilities.","2924":"I was really looking forward to this album and bought it without doing any research other than listening to the first single, \"The End,\" which I liked.  If only I could say the same for the rest of the album.  I loved Wired and We Control.  And I salute artists attempting to flex their musical muscles and experiment - but that doesn't mean I have to like the results.\n\nThe album is very uneven, with a couple of solid tracks mixed in with some *dubstep* - which I cannot stand - and some too-noisy-to-be-interesting electro.  Some of it's just flat-out awful.  If you like Hyper's previous work, it's worth just buying the tracks where you like the samples.","2925":"This isn't a very good version of A Love Supreme.  It gets better when the horns get busy in the second half, but it's still not amazing.  If you've read my other reviews you know I'm a friend to cover versions, but I don't feel Gordon has added anything to make the composition his own.  I saw the Campbell Brothers do A Love Supreme and they were INCREDIBLE.  This version doesn't measure up.","2926":"Reminds me of stuffy old rich people. Just not ready for that kind of music. Does sound impressive on my new stereo.","2927":"A Heart Throb , served rare in my experience.  It will remind you of\n\nsomeone far away that you always remember even tho your separate\n\ncareer plans are in different locations. He named this CD Laura.\n\nAnd his love for her mirrors my love for the people I love that\n\nI am unable to visit at this time and esp. my heart throbs.\n\nI am glad to have found this CD which has helped me to feel.\n\nMerci, XieXie , Thank-you, DIEGO GARCIA\n\nWith Love , Kalmia","2928":"Another one that keeps getting stuck in my head.","2929":"Awesome disc. So this is what bass heads been raving for... Bass I love you","2930":"Never got it...don't know where to look to get it\/","2931":"All of the songs in the Album sounds somewhat similar. It appears that he just spent time to make one song good and then tweaked the same song to create others to make it an Album. The 'Bass i love you' song is awesome. and if you like to see your subwoofer moving, choose 'sub excursion'. Other than that it is not worth the money.","2932":"This one failed to please and went into the round file.  Well, at least most of their work is much better.","2933":"Absolutely beautiful!!!  The hymns are well known, well loved and magnificently sung! Love the organ and men and boys' voices.  Takes me back to my youth singing in the choir.","2934":"currently enjoying these masterpieces!","2935":"I wanted to learn some old hymns. I can't hear the words of the hymns. It might as well be instrumental. The Christmas section has seemed to have hymns that aren't familiar. This would be good for someone who is in their 70's or 80's who can remember the lyrics to some of the melodies. They wouldn't however be able to understand whatever lyrics they forgot.","2936":"Inspirational, uplifting, just what everyone needs to hear to have an uplifting day.\nThe lift we all need to have a better focus on Christ.","2937":"This is an old Newsboys song but with new singer Michael Tate on the mic. I loved the old version but I'm just head over heals for this one! the production is a little different,where the old version has stringed instrumens this has more synthetic sounds. Better backing vocals. I'd like to see more of Michael Tate singing some Newsboys classics.","2938":"This band has some great polka music, this was fun to listen to and is more on the modern side.","2939":"Great band","2940":"This song is the \"new\" Newsboys remake on a popular Christian contemporary song. Song is very worshipful.","2941":"a wonderful blend of contemporary, a little hip-hop, with clear&crisp, easily understood vocals, and some traditional sounds. Michael Tait(from DCtalk)is lead singer in this cd and continues the newsboys outstanding reputation for quality music and deep messages.","2942":"I like this song","2943":"This is a really Awesome song done by one of the ex members of Dc Talk it's done different but still Awesome: )","2944":"You missed her. She is awesome.","2945":"This song should not have been added to the special edition version of my favorite album of all time.

The Lord of The Dance done by The Dubliners...can't go wrong....get it. OK gotta' write more but I already got my point across...good Irish music praising Our Lord Jesus...Happy Saint Paddy's Day!

Very disappointed","2949":"Great Cd love Bo And Ben","2950":"Love you bo. But chioce of songs on the CD leaves a bit to be desired","2951":"It is a very good Brazilian music, bossa-nova, and very well executed. All the musics from the movie \"Rio\" are wonderful as well as the movie.","2952":"The Risen Christ is one of my favorite Christian songs. Beautiful tune, touching lyrics, and great performance - it's a true praise and worship from the heart.\n\nThe risen Christ my Shepherd is.\nHe graciously my soul doth feed.\nMy Christ is mine, and I am His.\nHow can I lack or e'er have need?\n\nIn pastures green He makes me lie.\nMy soul He satisfies always,\nThe restful water leads me by,\nIn fellowship and perfect peace.\n\nI often stray; He seeketh me\nTo yield my heart to His control.\nFor His name's sake He leadeth me\nAnd shepherds my oft-shaken soul.\n\nIncredible the thought beside--\nPursuing Thee all care is stilled.\nThy rod and staff support and guide;\nMy way is with Thy presence filled.\n\nEmboldened in Thy victory,\nI feast surrounded by my foes,\nMy head anointed bountifully,\nMy cup with blessings overflows.\n\nThy love the measure of my days,\nThy grace a boundless treasure store;\nGood Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise\nWithin Thy house forevermore.\n\nPraise the Lord!","2953":"Must get","2954":"I wanted to like this--I first found out about Natasha Leggero from Burning Love (the webseries\/tv show) so I thought she'd have my sense of humor... instead she was just well, mean.

I'll stick to comedians like Maria Bamford, Patton Oswalt and Jim Gaffigan... she just doesn't do it for me.","2955":"Wasn't impressed","2956":"This is a terrible rendition of this classic Delaney and Bonnie tune. It's played way too fast and the voices are Mickey Mouse-like","2957":"For some reason it is hard to find decent techno remixes on Amazon.  This artist uses the transform sound effects over and over in this track.  What was a cool sound from my childhood, has been reduced to an annoyance.","2958":"How are customers supposed to purchase a CD without knowing which songs are included? There are several Sarit Hadad CDs advertised on Amazon, and none of these list the songs included.\n\nDavid Marks\nAventura, FL","2959":"This song is not what I would listen too but was on a client's list so I had to try to get it to play it. Very slow and I was trying for upbeat at a company lunch party.","2960":"I wouldn't buy the entire CD, but there's a few songs on there I really like. I heard it on YouTube first. It's a great place to preview songs.","2961":"Underrated. I love every song on this album! Surprised the only hit was D.O.A. A  few others made it as 45 rpm singles as well","2962":"Really like it and enjoy it.","2963":"wow  i  was  thrilled  to  hear  this  long  lost  uk  outfit  was  back  together  a  year  or  so  ago  but  i  had  no  clue  this  comeback  cd  would  be  as  good  as  the  archer  brothers  said  it  was  going  to  be,  this  album  is  even  heavier  then  there  classic  white  wine  n  roses  ep  or  the  live  bootleg  from  1982,  it  leaves  there  last  opus  (hurricain  town  1983)  in  the  dust,  to  bad  it  took  28  years  for  this  to  follow  that  album  up  but  this  is  about  the  best  comeback  album  ive  ever  heard,  very  oldschool  production,  very  oldschool  sound  a  must  for  nwobhm  fans,  there  is  nothing  modern  sounding  about  this  record  i  could  play  this  for  you  and  if  you  did  not  know  any  better  i  could  tell  you  this  was  recorded  in  1982  and  you  would  belive  me  that  is  how  oldschool  this  is,  a  total  must!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","2964":"This song is just another use of auto tune to help those without talent and without pitch not be as embarrassed as I was for purchasing this song.  I don't believe the singer really felt this song, as the delivery was horrible.  Bad performance, bad auto tune.","2965":"I liked the cheap price, it is one of my favorite glee original songs, and it transferred to itunes easily.","2966":"Good gospel group","2967":"I have enjoyed the cd, most of all the song on it \"When Faith Steps In\".  Its a song to remind you that when you can't count on anything else thats when faith steps in.","2968":"Very sucky song... how did these guys even get one with Facedown smh . . . . . . .","2969":"The 3rd CD was supposed to be available on the FJH website as a free download.  That's no long an option.  Love the method book, hate the fact that they are charging for the 3rd CD.","2970":"Not my type of music, thus would not buy any more.  Have deleted what I download, since I do not care for the music.","2971":"The only reason I have this CD is that my sister got a copy for free and gave it to me.  I guess the idea is that it is supposed to be \"lounge music\" with a modern dance beat.  Whatever they were trying to do here, it doesn't work.  It is very boring instrumental music, other than \"Away\", which is a song sung by an anonymous female vocalist who is buried so far back in the mix that it's hard to undertstand what she's singing.  I have no idea who is responsible for this dreck, since there are no producer, writer or musicians credits on the CD.  Too embarrassed to take credit for it, guys?  Can't say I blame you.","2972":"From the title, you would think it's lounge music, wouldn't you?  WRONG!  It's trance meets Macarena meets Oxygene meets Adiemus meets Legend of Zelda.  Still, it would make fine background music for a lovemaking session with a woman you didn't really care if you ever saw again.  A cow-orker got this as a freebie from some DVD-of-the-month club and gave it to me.  I am glad that neither of us actually paid anything for it.","2973":"I was heard the song on Pandora and again it came on. With one click on Pandora it was mine. This song reminds me of.........","2974":"Great cd. Fast delivery. Thanks.","2975":"I was excited when I saw this one. Love Larry Coryell's playing. Must admit I am a bit disappointed.

That was about all I can say that was good about it!","2978":"great deal","2979":"Not the music I was expecting it to sound like. Deleted it from my Kindle Fire.

The whole CD version of this MP3 package lasts under 80 minutes (fits on one CD) -see\nhttp:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/title\/lieder\/oclc\/707390055\nand here is a track listing for the whole thing showing 3:38 for Fidelity:\nhttp:\/\/www.allmusic.com\/album\/joseph-haydn-lieder-mw0002119478\n\nI have not purchased the disc (this review would not be accepted without some \"star\" from me) and I know of no way to suggest a change to this false \"information\" (anymore) except as a review. (Which is as well; the last time I suggested a change to Amazon back when it was possible- suggesting to Amazon that a book by Donald Francis Tovey could not have been copyrighted in 1870, given that he was not born until 1875 and was not known to have been much of an embryonic talent in the making - my suggested change was rejected. So goes, though, so goes!)","2982":"very nice","2983":"This was free... it is not my type of music... I do not like it at all... but that does not make it bad.  How does one objectively review music for other people to review?","2984":"Great song, great riffs, heavy sounding, very wholesome tune...... . . . . . . . . . . . .","2985":"I'm not a music reviewer, and certainly not a sound track reviewer.\n\nWhat I CAN tell you is that in the movie this song is split in half between the very beginning and the ending credits.  The soundtrack version is all one piece.\nThe beginning of the song builds with the rhythmic bird sounds into the actual song and is a lot of fun.","2986":"Not my cup o tea","2987":"its a great song","2988":"VERY BRUTAL TRACK! I know no one will ever see this review so why does it matter. .. . .","2989":"My 4-year-old loves this movie, and so do I. I went on Amazon music and downloaded a couple of the songs and that is what my kids listen to when I wake them up in the morning.","2990":"Though a wonderful testiment to the life of Diana it is very short. I believe it is a minute and a half. I would like to have had at least three minutes.","2991":"its a great song","2992":"don'y know why i bought the mp3 it sucks!! 18 freaking words is ridicoulous! how many ways do i have to say it sucked i hated it or it was awesome to get the point across? i can do it in 1 freaking word every time","2993":"it was free so i downloaded it. cant listen to it anymore as i deleted the app that was required to have to listen to the songs since it took up too much space on my phone","2994":"Great album","2995":"Oh, I did NOT read the fine print, so to speak!  I was so excited when I saw the title I neglected to look at the artist\/composer.  I was looking for Dave Brubeck's jazz compilation and not what I received. The selections are similar; I enjoy soundrack scores and if there was more variety I would have given it more stars.  Maybe when I am less disappointed I will re-listen to the soundtrack and enjoy it more, but today, quite dissatisfied.","2996":"once again this is a good song to work out on. i sweat bullets every time i hear it. its definitely staying in my iPod.","2997":"I wanted the original version of this track, and i got this. Why don't you have the song I'm listening to available. If i hit buy track, why would you think I'd wanna buy a song that isn't even playing...?wtf","2998":"This song tells you the rules of the game, and the code of the streets. Face did h\nis thang with this classic!","2999":"I bought his CD because it has A.P., Sara and Maybelle on the cover and I figured it was their recordings from the thirties. Wrong. I don't know the various relatives of the Carters, but this was recorded in stereo, thus had to be at least late fifties, sounds like the seventies (electric guitars and a Bobby Goldsboro tune). There are no liner notes, just song titles and no song writers. It was made in the Czech Republic, so maybe they have no idea who these people are (is this the family that lived in the White House in the seventies?). The music's not bad, but I'd sure like to know which generation of the Carters is singing (third removed nephews and nieces?). Finally, the best compilation I have is \"Keep On The Sunny Side: An Introduction To The Carter Family\" which has a great booklet and cover.\nHope this is helpful.","3000":"My chinese son loves this song with all his chopsticks.

It has a very dynamic range. It's a blood pumping score done in a very classy style. I highly recommend it.","3004":"This recording contains a fine performance of the first two movements of Richard Strauss's Sonatina No. 1 (\"From the Workshop of an Invalid\").  Sadly, in place of the third movement, the MP3 download simply repeats the first movement.  Hence the single star.","3005":"I grow-up in Michigan and used to listen to her dad as a teenager.  Just like her daddy could play the piano, Niki can sang a song!","3006":"I like the melody of the song.","3007":"I didn't order this","3008":"yup","3009":"Sounds stupid because it is censored and it isn't smooth you can hear every single spot that has been censored.","3010":"Every time Wiz Khalifa cusses in the song it cuts off abruptly, and it sounds terrible!  He clearly put no effort into this version and doesn't care about his listeners.","3011":"song","3012":"Good song","3013":"Porcelain Black is what Rock N Roll looks like 100%. Her Voice is incredibly unique and she's bringing a real rockers voice back to the main stream. Excellent music, you will not regret this purchase! Instantly Hooked.","3014":"I bought this song after hearing at a west coast swing competition.  Its great to dance to and lends itself to a WCS or Hustle very easily.","3015":"This music is to be experienced. It will move your soul. Jenny Bird has taken quotes from the spiritual masters of our world and set them to music. No matter what your particular beliefs, this music will move you. From Buddha to Jesus, from Rumi to Martin Luther King, you've never heard anything like this. Jenny has a wonderful voice and spirit that are particularly beautifully represented here. Give it a listen!","3016":"okay","3017":"Just play it over and over again! I recommend this so to anyway who seeks encouragement. Just have faith and believe.","3018":"I didn't order this","3019":"Did not buy this!!!","3020":"This is great gospel music, I love it","3021":"I did not like it, it was a  waste of my money.","3022":"I regret purchasing this album. Terrible song selection although the singers have nice voices. I was not inspired as the title indicates.","3023":"Awesome song, lots of memories!","3024":"This is the most unique song I have ever heard from her, it brings about feeling of fear, dread, sorrow, it really pulls at you.","3025":"Plays on my kindle very very good, I downloaded more music and had no problem . The music has God quality sound.","3026":"Good lyrics and good musicianship. \"Song For The Church\" is one of the best songs ever! Would have liked it better if they had rocked with some good guitar play.","3027":"This is one of those albums that reminds me of a very poignant time in my pilgrimage in the mid to late 70's. Parable is one of the more obscure groups from Maranatha music; nevertheless, it's one the best in my opinion.  I've been looking for this album and Parables' second album, Illustrations, for years.  This is a great find. Great music. Great lyrics.","3028":"My wife asked me to get this song which is the only reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1. Tortuously slow like a funeral dirge, it builds to the same repetitive refrain only louder... a relief when it ends.","3029":"Good music, but it's a rip-off. I bought the entire \"album\" on a whim and quickly regretted it. There is only one track on this \"album\" that is over 1 minute long. Most of them are about 15 seconds long. There are 3 tracks that are UNDER 10 seconds long (6 seconds, 7 seconds & 9 seconds). If I paid 50 cents for this, I wouldn't be upset.......but $8???? Save your money.","3030":"I purchased three songs @ $.99 each and received a 7 second sample a 6 second sample and a 30 second sample. No complete song. DON'T even consider this rip off","3031":"I've been following roger clyne since his early days with the refreshments. good music.","3032":"9 seconds for a dollar?  NO.  The least they could have done is loop it longer, and not being sure this can be looped cleanly, no thanks.","3033":"I remember purchasing this as a teenager back in the late 70's shortly after its release and being impressed with the how these classic hymns were refreshed with more modern arrangements. This was and still is one of my favorite albums and am so grateful that I have been able to get in CD format. This collection is worthy of offering praise to God and His Son, Jesus!","3034":"Would not download to Android. It appears that you can only sign up for and pay for Amazon Prime music service and pay a subscription fee, rather than purchase individual songs. So it could download to laptop, but not android. I could be wrong but this seems to be an effort to require buyers to use Amazon Prime and pay the subscription fee.","3035":"Classic Pearl Jam sound. Feels like it should be on the album \"Ten\".","3036":"Good sound fx but the clip was way too short for the money.","3037":"Great Pjam at their best","3038":"This artist is my oldest brother and of course I love the song. I was led to the Lord through this song and many others he wrote. I thank sweet Jesus for giving me Rob as my brother.","3039":"Not Song I Was Told It Would Be SUCKED","3040":"good song","3041":"Best album they ever made. Glad its still available. The sound quality since it was remastered is better too. Worth the money","3042":"Total ripoff! Amazon will sell you a MP3 file then substitute an AMZ that can only be played with their cloud player. Don't by their MP3 files if you really want a MP3 file.","3043":"$9.49 for the album of 13 songs. Upon purchase only 4 songs are downloaded, which were $0.99 each. Also not on cloud","3044":"Hard to find batch of tracks from Los Hitters. Buyer beware: This is not an oficial release by Orfeon, only released as a three LP set. Don't let the foreign language fool you unless you don't mind paying a high price for a computer copy.","3045":"I loved the original Leon Patillo recordings but this is far removed from those. The music accompaniment is so basic that he may as well be singing to bongos. I was very disappointed.","3046":"Jennifer Warns is Grammy Award winning recording artist, singer of Academy Award winning, nominated movie themes. Plus with her singing style of her own. And a great Voice, with so many Hits I like them all .","3047":"Great stuff!","3048":"yeah....","3049":"I am a fan of subliminal programs although not of brainwave binaural beat programs, and I bought this one to motivate me to try a French language course. However, I must say I am tired of subliminal CD's and MP3's that do not let the buyer know what messages they will be receiving in their music, nature sound, or \"silent\" programs. Silent? Does that mean homeopathic subliminal, ie-nothing in it?\nA list of the suggestions would be especially nice on the subliminals that cannot be heard over music, nature sounds, etc.. This is one of those programs-ocean sounds to learn french. But it does not say crave french language studies,  learn\/adapt to French more easily, or actually learn the language, ok, clearly the last one-not. Should one listen during studies,at night, before study, after study, what is the purpose? Also, if this is a brainwave or binaural it should be labled as such.\nNow here is the truth, the most one can hope for in subliminal language learning programs is to heighten the desire to learn the language, take a class in the language, or heighten the ability of the listener to learn or develop linguistic skills when they are in classes, working the speech lab, or using a language course\/album. This album lacks a description of which type of message you are getting.\nAlthough this is a pleasant sounding program, nice ocean sounds, etc., I prefer the types of programs where one can audibly hear the suggestions even if only as a whisper in the background. Also, whether I can hear the message audibly or not, I cannot see why the makers of these programs are unwilling to provide a description on the site of the messages used in the programs. Some of the programs I purchased for weight loss were nicely effective after a couple of weeks. They had audible messages in the programs and lots of reviews.\nI have not yet gone 2 weeks with this program, but a similar program I purchased for another issue with ocean waves and no audible message has not been effective. My husband said at this price just try it. I gave it two stars for having really soothing sounds. If if works I will update the review. I will try it but it is time to get message descriptions on these subliminal MP3's &CD's. If you listen to the previews, some of them are great, some are not informative of content other than a title, some include binaural programs but don't say that on the covers\/titles, some are simple meditation programs, some appear to be scientology subliminals,& others are downright weird. Please start giving clear content\/message descriptions so buyers can be sure of what they are buying!","3050":"Easy download","3051":"When I opened package there was NO NO  cd  in the case!!!! Seriously an empty case! Please advise","3052":"Great quality, great song! It is definitely worth the 99 cent investment to own this song.  I may purchase the whole album.","3053":"Recorded live in 1968, \"Highlights From I Puritani\" 's only redeeming feature is, for me, Pavarotti's fine voice.\n\nIt's an historic recording and sounds very much like yesterday's recording technology.\n\nSix dollars with shipping ... if you can look past the second rate sound and not expect much from the other singers or the musical accompaniment, then more power to ya. It's one order I'd like to have back ... oh well.","3054":"Love it!","3055":"Although the music is good I thought I was buying their Christmas Hallelujah Song and it isn't on this album.","3056":"I first saw Cloverton on GodTube doing \"A Hallelujah Christmas\" which I loved and then bought on Amazon. I then joyfully discovered this EP and a second called, \"The End is The Beginning.\" After listening to the samples I bought them both. What a great voice and great lyrics. The band and the songwriting are also excellent. There is a lot of Christian music today that is good. These guys are a cut above. I hope people will fall in love with them as I have and their success will mean more great music from Cloverton.","3057":"I heard this on a tv program and liked it, so I paused the program and, using my Shazam app on my cell phone, identified the song. We have found a lot of good songs that way because programs like The Black List and CSI have great music.","3058":"All downloaded songs from this album had very bad quality. It could be a bad recording or problem with the server. In any case, I was unable to downloaded a second time to verify.\nBe careful when buying songs, check them before paying.","3059":"This is a great song.  Honestly, I can't stand Sparky outside of this song, but something in his voice takes this song to the next level.","3060":"Great song, laid back and easy to listen to. Their voices combined make so an inviting and haunting experience. I LOVE it!!","3061":"LOVE THIS SONG , A FAV.....","3062":"My favorite song!","3063":"So I bought this a couple years ago and I loved it so much. I use these sorts of soundtracks to help me concentrate when writing my book and I got a new computer since I bought it, and now I can't find it. I know I bought it from Amazon but now it's not in my cloud, which makes me very sad because this is a beautiful soundtrack for a sims game. Usually The Sims doesn't make me think of wonderful soundtrack music, but this one does. So now I need to figure it out so I can listen to it while I write again.","3064":"I wrote a review for his sophomore album prior to this one (in case my headline didn't make sense). I love both of his albums & I'm eager to hear the rest of his 3rd album. My favorite song on this album: All Night to Get There. I first heard his music about 3 years ago & he's been a daily listener for me ever since. It'd be nice if the current country \"hits\" now sounded like this.","3065":"GR8 BAND....","3066":"Beautiful melody, beautiful voice.","3067":"All songs downloaded from this album had very bad quality. I am not sure if it was bad recording or problems with the sever. I was unable to downloaded again to find out.","3068":"Part of my wife's themed going away party for her friend!","3069":"This CD has you going.  E40 is a great artist and i cant wait to see what he comes out with next.","3070":"As I said in my other review this album is fire. Both albums are great and if you are a true 40 fan you will not be disappointed!  The beats and lyrics are bangin, a true spitter is what 40 is.  You do not find to many albums where you can listen from beginning to end but on these two albums you can.  Some of the songs have ok beats but that doesn't matter because the lyrics make up for it! I would definitely recommend getting both of these albums!!","3071":"After being linked to \"Saying\" from a friend, I sought out and purchased the EP. After hearing \"Saying,\" the other four tracks on the EP are well varied, really only tied together by Vital's interesting voice and the upbeat feel of all the tracks. Vital's voice reminds me of Kid Cudi, though his lyric work is simplified, mellow. He \"ooh\"s and \"ahh\"s quite a bit, and I can hear his voice over a Telepopmusik track. Neither bad things, mind you.\n\nThe five songs travel from relaxed and atmospheric (Saying) to bubbly (Going Back) to radio-friendly, rock-ish songs (Read It and Airport). While I overall enjoy the sound and feel of the Vital EP, I enjoy it more as background music and not as a direct listening experience. Worth checking out if you like laid-back, aurally varied music.","3072":"cause I'm from that Hill Side..","3073":"E-40 (Hillside)\nThis file was D\/L'd and upon review had a bitrate of:  237 kbps (variable)\n\nAlso, for some reason (either, originally made or was file modified-upload),\nbut this file had massive \"clipping\" and distortion. Used Audacity to detect\nclipping areas in the file... the results looked like a solid red-brick. Not only\nwas certain and various or specific bass note freq. enhanced\/modified\/gain\nbut also higher frequencies at \"in-consistant\" cycle through-out the song.\n...\nImagine a repeating 5 second tempo or rythmm.  It would show clipping or\ndistortion for a \"certain\" note but may or may-not (consistantly) clip\/distort\nthe same note when repeated (if that makes sense). It's just odd that some\nnotes were adjusted\/increased w\/ no consistency or pattern....in the scale.","3074":"This MP3 recording sold on Amazon is made from a damaged CD. I am unable to listen to the tracks because nearly every track has defects.","3075":"These two have voices made to duet.  I wish they would record more songs but will enjoy their live performances in the meantime.","3076":"very good","3077":"Here is one that slipped by a lot of fans of UO, this is the bands 2011 comeback album.  While this isn't a blockbuster comeback CD this is a good sturdy addition to their catalog that will please most of the bands fans.  It should have done better!","3078":"A masterful album. Abdullah Ibrahim and Ekaya at the height of artistry.","3079":"Refreshing and melodic. No. 9 is the real gem, here. Very Enya-esque (Shepherd Moons era). I bought the CD through bandcamp just for that song, alone. Many other good songs on here as well.","3080":"Bland and boring with little to recommend it","3081":"Strange","3082":"Bought this by mistake and boy do I regret it.  P! Nk's song is a moving tribute to surviving childhood traumas.  This \"tribute\" is an incoherent and annoying mess.  Couldn't listen to more than 30 seconds.  Avoid","3083":"Excellent album, grows on me the more that I listen to it. Beautiful voice.","3084":"Great artist.... Always has something new to listen to. Great song with such good quality. Just about love any song this person composes.","3085":"Phil Spector was perhaps wise to ban Ike from the studio when Tina laid down her gut-wrenching vocals. The urban legend has it that the lack of success of his \"Wall Of Sound\" crowning achievement in the U.S. angered him to the point that he nearly disappeared from the music scene until he got hold of Let It Be...although this track was a massive success everywhere else. I'm glad this version is now widely available as opposed to the lame non-Phil re-recording that shows up in later greatest hits packages. Now, if we can just talk Celine Dion into releasing the version of this song she recorded with Phil at the controls, and not the so-so Spector-less version that was released.","3086":"I LISTEN TO SKYFM SMOOTH JAZZ ON A DAILY BASIS JUST BECAUSE I CANNOT FIND THE TYPE OF MUSIC PLAYED ONTHAT STATION ANYWHERE ELSE! I FIRST HEARD KOOL & KLEAN ON THAT STATION AND INSTANTLY FELL IN LOVE WITH ALL OF THEIR MUSIC! SIMPLY THE BEST!","3087":"This great cut from the \"River Deep-Mountain High\" album was produced by Phil Spector and composed by Ellie Greenwich, Jeff Barry, and Phil Spector. The cut has great riffs and Tina's performance rocks with lots of soul. This entire album is the best!!!","3088":"This music is better than kenny g and any jazz i ever listen to kool&klean is my jazz group from now on amazon great place to shop and price is great","3089":"Oh man!! These guys are awesome. I've seen them play a bunch of times. Although it's total blasphamy, I would totally compare them to The Beatles. You've got three songwriters, with their own personalities and energy that combine to produce something unmistakeable. This record finally gets all that stuff on tape. Top notch ROCK, er, ART, er, LOVE.","3090":"kids love it","3091":"My kids LOVED this CD when they were young...and now they want it for their children!  The songs are alef alef and the story is really interesting.","3092":"I first heard Tracy Nelson in the late 1960's, early 70's and bought everything I could find by her. She has an amazing voice and can really do the blues. This CD does not disappoint, but then I have loved Tracy's music over 4 decades. She is a vastly under appreciated artist in my opinion, but then, some of the best never made it big in mainstream commercial music. Good seller, no problems.","3093":"I wasn't sure how I would like this album once i heard it fully. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It was much better then I had expected. A Winner!","3094":"The material was ok.  I expected a better version of the song.  I am not crazy about it, but I can live with the purchase.","3095":"Great, but could have had more drums.","3096":"When I'm writing, programming or need to concentrate on something I prefer music without words, I find it less distracting. Also when working out I like to have something that is fast beat with a lot of bass. So I enjoy this collection for those reasons.","3097":"I love the song but it didn't download to my media library but I still got charged for it","3098":"How this can be called the \"complete\" soundtrack is beyond me, when Ray LaMontagne's adaptation of \"Empty,\" is missing?  The ending-credits song was obviously adapted from Ray LaMontagne's \"Empty,\" but it is not quite the same, and it is missing from this soundtrack.\n\n\"Complete?\"","3099":"The sound definitions are crisp and clear, the beat is good, and Mike does a good job on the words.","3100":"Great CD, I like it as much as Supernova. I just wish it was in a jewel case instead of the slip sleeve. Get it, it rocks.","3101":"I purchased this CD for the live Andrew Bird track, Imitosis (which is awesome), but the majority of the CD is great as well. There are 2 or 3 songs I skip over, but overall good stuff.","3102":"These two are so good they are already so popular on youtube, they will be famous in no time! At least the female, she is AMAZING.  No matter what style she tries, she blows it out of the water.  Love the acoustic\/ pop\/ hip hop style.","3103":"I listened the Jorge Quintero on YouTube and this was a good piece of work.  I would like to see more work.  I did not give an excellent rating for I have heard better Electronic work from the other DJ and Producers that are published.","3104":"There are a lot of Lou Reed songs I really like, and although this isn't your typical Lou Reed, it is one of my favorites. As a Vietnam combat vet (wounded\/disabled) of the USMC I find the lyrics to be one of my favorite \"poems\" regarding the war from a \"grunt's perspective). The The play-on-words linking Tet with \"Xmas in February\" is done just so right on.\n\nThe dual guitar work is also just right for this tune.","3105":"BECAUSE IT IS SOOO  TRUE.  I FOUND IT OUT MYSELF !  Jimmy does a great job, as always. Praise the Lord !","3106":"Great tune high quality recording. Still holds up to repeated plays.","3107":"The first time I heard \"Ring of Fire\" it was a version by June Carter Cash.  I hated it.  Hated everything about it, from the country twang and plodding beat to the cryptic yet sappy lyrics to Carter's painful-to-listen-to singing voice.  Johnny Cash's interpretation wasn't much better with mariachi band overtones, but at least his voice was easy on the ears (as is the original release by Anita Carter, June's younger sister).\n\nWhen I first heard Adam Lambert's cover, I had no idea it was even the same song.  Pitched in a minor key with middle eastern overtones, Lambert's musical phraseology breathes new life into the previously incomprehensible lyrics.  In fact, they are so sensual that I took some time to research the song to see if he changed any of them.  While I didn't discover any significant changes by Lambert, it seems there is an urban legend that Cash actually wrote the song but gave Carter credit for it so it wouldn't get tied up in his upcoming divorce from his first wife, and that the phrase \"ring of fire\" is a reference to female genitalia.  (I wonder if Adam knows...?)\n\nMy only complaint is that the song is over way too quickly.","3108":"I fell in love with this band's debut album, \"There be Squabbles Ahead,\" and purchased this release afterward.\n\nIt's not as upbeat as many of their previous songs, but I believe it fits their theme perfectly while at the same time sounding different from the rest of their work. A lot of great bands don't do that so well, and I was very pleased with this song.\n\nIf you like dark, original, musis, unique in both vocals and instrument, I recommend giving this song, and this band, a try.","3109":"Someone recommend me this song, so I listened on Kevin's website and decided to purchase it. The song's light tempo and simple melody is very good to listen.","3110":"I had gotten far down the road from John Denver's tunes and seemed to have disconnected from his progress back in the Seventies. I decided to visit his works again and realized John has a lot more recorded. I love this Suite. Now I feel compelled to pursue more of his works.","3111":"You can listen to the song on Amazon so you know exactly you are buying.","3112":"Wanted to use for sound track to vacation video but due to imbedded pictures it would not work with my software.  Very disappointed.","3113":"Love the sensation..","3114":"Great song.  I have been using it weekly with my 1st and 2nd grade Sunday School class.","3115":"I bought the regular version NOT the split track. I even check and it says I already bought it but everytime I downloaded it, it is still the same, the SPLIT track.","3116":"I thought I was purchasing the entire hymn, was disappointed to learn it was only one verse! Otherwise it was great!","3117":"I thought it was going to be in French","3118":"Classic country","3119":"Get's two stars for the three songs I like. Not a fan of the rest of the album.","3120":"Another killer find in the Hotel Costes series! Beautiful French vocals layered over a thumping reggae rhytm.  Nice synthesizer work as well. If you're into the cafe style music BUY THIS TRACK!!!","3121":"I have some of these recordings on a late 90's Great Pianists\/Phillips recording  but have read glowing reviews about the latest transfers  by Mark Obert-Thorn,who has remastered the original 78's in 2008 or 9  for Naxos.  Unfortunately, they are not being sold in the U.S.  and I had to import from Germany via an Amazon distributor for  about $10  delivered.  Still, it was worth every penny  as  Rach's piano now sounds almost like it was recorded in the early 50's ..so noticeable are the improvements to the piano timbre and solidity of sound.  I have ordered Volume 3, which includes him  recording all of his solo works  plus those of other Russians . Can't wait to get it...  and also VOL 1..which is not currently available via Amazon.","3122":"Great Music","3123":"perfect rhythm for dancingand if not dancing just enjoy listening to the beat.  You won't be able to sit still.","3124":"I would say nothing but a little \"turd\" for cd. I used to like it. They were doing far too many drugs when they were trying to make this","3125":"I have much of Stephane  Pompougnac's Hotel Costes collection. While some are better than others, this one (Costes Presente Bon Voyage) is an absolute rip off. The music itself is far less original than what I've come to expect from Stephane. Also It lists 14 tracks on the CD cover. The disc only has 12. Thinking it was a bad disc I exchanged it with the dealer through Amazon. Still the same problem. So, Buyer  beware. Thankfully, Amazon and the dealer have integrity. Can't say that much for the original distributor who put this on the market to begin with.","3126":"A slightly longer sample or one from a different part of the music would have alerted me to the fact there is a very strange note 11 seconds in. The second occurrence of \"David\" has a pitch on the second syllable that is different from what anyone else sings or appears in any of the printed music. This makes and otherwise good recording totally unusable for teaching the song to preschoolers.\n\nOnly a boy named David\nOnly a little sling\nOnly a boy named David (\"vid\" of David is the problem pitch)\nBut he could pray and sing\nOnly a boy named David\nOnly a rippling brook (preview sample begins on the word \"brook\" and continues to end of song)\nOnly a boy named David\nBut five little stones he took\nAnd one little stone went in the sling and the sling went round and round\nAnd one little stone went in the sling and the sling went round and round\nAnd round and round\nAnd round and round\nAnd round and round and round\nAnd one little stone went up in the air\nAnd the giant came tumbling down","3127":"This cd sounded like it was recorded by unprofessional equipment.","3128":"I might be a little bias, but loving these songs on this album.  Will definitely be buying the cds for my car.  Bought this song for my Kindle Fire.","3129":"Only a few seconds difficult to evaluate","3130":"The song just capture the feelings of the ones who lost their father and care for their family members. Beautiful melody and great interpretation.","3131":"This is truly a great soundtrack\nIf you love the Adventures of Ford Fairlane it a must have\nI came across the cd soundtrack around 1996 in a used cd, vhs, video games Store\nI know at the time i over payed $9.99 give or take but, it was just very cool to find this cd\nSince i loved the film I mostly got it for\nCradle of Love but, this soundtrack is really good top to bottom\nIt's a strong album to a film that came and went due to various special interest groups, etc,\n(See my Love letter to the Adventure of Ford Fairlane Blu Ray)\n\nTrack Run down listing is as follows:\n1.  Cradle of Love (Performed by Billy Idol) you can know gets this song on Billy Idol's Greatest Hits Album\n2.  Sea Cruise (Performed by Dion it's a so\/so cover.  now it's sounds a bit dated Not the worst cover though!\n3. Funky Attitude (Performed by Shelia E.) Still a very good sounding pop song it makes me wonder where Shelia E really went the chick can sing!\n4. Glad to be Alive  (Performed by Teddy Pendergrass & Lisa Fisher)  Awesome SOng!!!!!  this track alone should make any music fan pick up this cd not sure if you can get this on mp3.... Great simple song but, it's so good perfect song! I'd love to know if Electra Records ever tried to push this song as a Radio Single it's really good\n5. Can't Get Enough  (Performed by Tone Loc)  this is the track on the cd that dates this entire cd doesn't hold up terrible song\n6. Rock 'N Roll Junkie  (Performed by Motley Crue) Great Rock song I'm pretty sure you can find this song on other BO Albums too though\n7.  I Ain't Got You (Performed by Andrew Dice Clay) Not terrible but, it's a novelty song\nwas there smoke and mirrors during the studio time while he did his vocals??? maybe? maybe not??? people forget The Dice man use to be able to Mimic people like Sylvester Stallone,  and John Travolta\n8. Last Time In Paris  (Performed by Queensryche)\n9. Unbelievable (Theme from \"Ford Fairlane\"  performed by Yellow\n10.  The Wind Cries Mary  (Performed by Richie Sambora)  another cover but, a HQ cover this is another song that makes this cd a must have\n\nYou can still snatch this for a pretty cheap price\nIt's without a doubt worth it\nIt's one of the most unrated motion picture soundtrack with 8\/10 very strong tracks\n\n9.5\/10","3132":"Omg this song takes you to a place you never been so beautiful so enchanting","3133":"Mana rules.","3134":"not good","3135":"Best workout cd","3136":"This song is sick! It should be so much more known, the owner should upload it on youtube and make some advertisement and also make some more songs!

But, Damon Albarn made the whole thing on his Ipad. That's awesome. I do like the music though.","3145":"Every track in this album was written in a different city in the Gorillaz 2010 US tour. They seem like they were recorded in down time on the tour and aren't terribly serious. There are no \"hits\" amongst this collection. And unfortunately, while most of these tracks aren't bad, they would be filler tracks on a regular album. So you end up with a CD of nothing but filler tracks.","3146":"Native Tongue is a very strange album mostly due to the shift\nC.C. DeVille was thrown-out of the band publicly and grunge rock was becoming the flavor of the week\n\nThey went from Glam rock band to a stripped down blues rock band\nNot nearly as cringe inducing as when Staind's Aaron Lewis went from heavy metal to country\nThe album itself is average but, has four very amazing tracks on it non the less\n\"Stand\"\n\"Body Talk\"\n\"Theatre of the Soul\"\n\"Until You Suffer Some (Fire and Ice)\"\n\n\"Theatre of the Soul\" is  a break-up song about former guitarist C.C. DeVille  and it's down right sad and beautiful at the same time\nIt's on the same level as the likes of \"Every Rose has It's Thorn\" and \"Give me Something to Believe In\"\n You wouldn't know this was Poison in 1993 it's amazing and was never pushed as a single wish makes no sense\n\nI'm sure most rock\/ hair metal fans missed Native Tongue due to the likes of Temple of the Dog, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Alice In Chains,\nSoundgarden taking over the music scene but, the four tracks i brought up should be discovered and cherished\nthey are all solid rock songs that got buried by a changing fad\nCheck out Theatre of the Soul and prove me wrong it's not  a flawless and heartbreaking song 10\/10","3147":"Good quality MP3s; overpriced for downloadable, when I can have Amazon make and ship the actual discs for $3 less.  But it's all about instant gratification these days.  Most of the mixes are good - but like a lot of dance music, there are tracks that you can tell were made specifically for mixing in with others in a club. There are few songs that are lesser-known in the states, but even those are good.  Overally, a very enjoyable addition to my collection.","3148":"Love this album - my 1.5 year old is running around clapping to all these songs, and I love what the songs teach about Jesus. Totally worth it for a toddler!","3149":"Nice music","3150":"I love all Johnny Reid songs.  I think he is a phenomenal talent.","3151":"Always loved the Gaithers and gospel singing.  My parents would take us to the \"All Night Gospel Sings\" during the 1960's in Jackson, Mississippi and this wonderful praise music brings back some sweet memories.

A great song from the Lafayettes in 1962.\nThis pop-rock group had only this one song to chart, RCA Victor #8044 (b\/s 'Nobody but you' ~ R&B flavor)\nIt's chart # (87) doesn't reflect the songs energy and spirit. I loved it the first time I heard it.\nIn high-school at the time, ran right out an bought the 45 record. Looked for it a long time to download.\nCouple years ago happened to find\/buy the original recording on itunes. Sadly, for now it's gone from there also.\nBoth can be found on YouTube\n\nOnly way I know to relate it's energy is to say, it's sorta similar ~\nVillage of love ~ Nathaniel Mayer\nI love you ~ The Volumes","3158":"Wheres the originality in groups today? Take songs from the 80s and copy them and they figure people won't know the difference. By the sound of this album,it shouldn't be hard to put you to sleep. D.M.","3159":"Didn't order this.","3160":"I downloaded this song after watching \"About a Boy\" on TV. I think its great also as a work out song especially if you ever feel like the under dog.","3161":"I would give this album a higher rating if I could!!!","3162":"I have been looking for this album since I was 16 years old and wore out the tape that a family friend had given us.\nIt was like Christmas, Birthdays and random gifts all rolled into one to be able to listen to this again :)","3163":"Give Brett a chance. The songs and the lyrics are amazing. I recommend this song for running long distances, good beat and great lyrics.","3164":"Completely disappointed! It's missing the line \"The sick are healed\". I wish I would have read the reviews before I got this.","3165":"I couldn't use I as it was missing a line. There's no way to fake that!  It goes from  the fatherless find their rest at the sound of your great name RIGHT TO the chorus.  It's supposed to be the sick are healed and the dead are raised the sound of your great name. THEN the chorus.","3166":"I'm so disappointed! ;(  It jumps from 'the fatherless the find there rest...\" line into the chorus and totally skips \"the sick are healed and the dead are raised...\"  VERY DISAPPOINTING download... and no way for refund. :(\nI hope you're reading the reviews first (unlike me)... Hope this stops someone else from making my mistake!!!","3167":"I bought this after listening to a couple of tracks online. The sound really struck me, it had atmosphere and emotion to it. Keys play a large role in this album driving a number of the tracks.  It's unique, but then at times still recalled the Thursday of old, with the intensity of the vocals and guitars.\n\nMy favourite tracks are: No Answers, Sparks Against the Sun, Magnets Caught in a Metal Heart and A Gun in the First Act. But all the songs are well worth listening to. No skipping tracks with this album.\n\nAll in all a pretty fantastic album to end their brilliant career.","3168":"I've been a fan of Thursday for years. They can't do wrong in my eyes. I love all their albums. Ever since I got this album I've played it non-stop daily. That's how amazing it is. My favorite songs so far are Fast to the End, Turnpike Divides, Magnets Caught in a Metal Heart, No Answers, Milimeter, etc.\n\nThe instrumental on Turnpike Divides is awesome. Hearing them play this song live is even better. I just saw them along with Taking Back Sunday in concert and Geoff is an insanely good singer\/performer live.\n\nI love how Thursday changes it up on every album. They're unique that way. I don't get why some people seem to want them to make albums similar to Full Collapse or something. I just don't get how anyone hates Common Existence or ACBTLD. Both awesome in my opinion. I listen to both of those albums a lot.\n\nGo get this album. If you criticize it, I just have to shake my head at you because you don't know good music.","3169":"I've been a fan of Thursday since I bought `Full Collapse' in 2002; I've since acquired all of their albums with my favorites being `Full Collapse' and `City by the Light Divided' and my least favorite being `Common Existence' (which still  wasn't really a bad album, just uneven).  I will say that, after 15 to 20 listens, this is their most accomplished and impressive work to date.  It really didn't hit me initially; the first couple spins didn't form any kind of opinion one way or the other and, while there wasn't anything that seemed `bad' about the music, it was just too dense to soak in right away.  But I highly recommend giving it a chance to grow on you as I guarantee you'll be just as rewarded as I was.  First, I think the production on this is by far their greatest; it's incredibly dense, multi-layered, and strikes the perfect balance of what I believe they were trying to do (and failed, in my opinion) with `Common Existence', in maintaining a dynamic of lo-fi, gritty, noisy texture with extremely technical and varied arrangements and instrumentation.  Next, one of the major surprises I'm sure many fans are going to encounter is that there really isn't much screaming on the album - maybe 30 seconds to a minute combined (and only present on 3 or 4 songs).  However, it would be incorrect to assume this is a `soft' album.  The aggression presented here is more subliminal and abstract then their prior work, which makes complete sense and is a perfect move for a band that is continuously evolving (and which is why they are still musically-relevant today even with being (unfortunately) roped into a genre that has long since died).  Take, for instance, the bridge in `A Darker Forest'; while there isn't any screaming, the music picks up after each verse with a thick riff, pounding snare and synth-bell accents, bringing to mind a passage the Swans might write, which is a fitting example of another band that understands how to create true heaviness with dynamics in more creative and minimal ways than what's usually expected.  And in regards to the drumming, this is clearly the drummer's best work.  In fact, from a musical perspective, this really is everyone's best work and it's more evident the more the CD is digested.  I wouldn't even know how to rate the songs individually as I always listen to the album in full as sequenced, which, I may add, could not be possibly arranged any better.  Overall, Thursday pushed forward again with an album that far exceeded personal expectations, especially after fearing a potential `Common Existence 2'.  It's their best work so far and has potential to go down as one of the best albums of the year, regardless of genre.","3170":"This is some really beautiful music that can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of age.","3171":"Got the song free years ago and lost it dividing up an iTunes account. Lives it enough to buy it this time around. Great dreamlike quality to it. A lot of emotion.","3172":"If you are a zep fan, you will love this.  If you are an old school phish fan, you will love this.  If you were there, you know that the energy was amazing.  I only wish every phish show that I go to was this incredible.","3173":"I ordered a new CD, but it looks used to me.  The box is full of scratches.","3174":"k d is the best","3175":"Love this song. It's a great song about how the speaker's girlfriend\/wife is enough for him\/he doesn't need a sidepiece, and how much he'd do to keep her. Nice beat and lyrics, good flow.","3176":"good song, the beatles version is better, but all in all Noel does a good job","3177":"This seemed to be recorded from an old scratched record. Very poorly recorded and poor representation of the song. Don't waste your money.","3178":"If you like atmosphere, you'll love this song.","3179":"Does not work","3180":"I MET MS. MINA WHEN SHE CAME TO CARACAS, VENEZUELA TO PERFORM IN THE RENNIE OTTOLINA SHOW IN 1965...I WAS A VERY YOUNG BOY...AND FELT IN LOVE WITH HER....AND THE FEELING STILL REMAIN....","3181":"While I wouldn't say these guys are original, that may be the point.  They sound like some of those 80's British New Wave groups; e.g., Haircut 100, the Housemartins and especially late Jam and The Style Council - with a kind of pop-soul sound with horns and very sweet sounding vocals.  Not bad at all.","3182":"I can see progress.  Since playing this mp3 I have noticed a change.  I also do the Emotional Health subliminal too, so I am not sure which one is responsible for my improvement.  I recognize when I am ruminating over things and can let things go now.  Definitely an improvement.\n\nNOTE:  The subliminals that have worked for me are:  Stop Snoring, Health Enhancement, Self-Healing, Emotional Health, Getting Rid of Emotional Baggage, Learning Genius, Skin Care Improvement, Memory Improvement, Be A Winner, Success and Prosperity and Salary Multiplier.","3183":"If you are a fan of organ Christmas music then this is a must simply beautiful to hear.\nIt is as if sitting in church hearing a beautiful pipe organ.","3184":"this sounds way to much like buckcherry for me to give it more then one listen...its horrible mainstream rock and if you want some real papa roach music go get infest","3185":"Give us the original version please...","3186":"A so-so recording of a not exciting performance. Very sad, I had high hopes. \"Doc\" rambled around the notes, but little solid music. I cannot reccomend this CD.","3187":"First, an important note: this is an on-demand recorded CD-R disk, not a pressed, manufactured audio disk. That means that some audio equipment may have difficulty reading the disk (mine does), and the permanence of the recorded audio is in question as the dye layer of the disk ages.\n\nAbout the music and the performance-- Vivaldi's concertos are often fairly light music but beautiful if performed appropriately. Unfortunately, some conductors and instrumental groups like to put their own highly individual stamp upon the music they perform, and the original composers are usually dead, so are not present to protest.\n\nThese performances are melodramatic and unpleasant. The audio is artificially constrained and too soft for long passages, and then suddenly, overwhelmingly too loud. The violins and other strings, which can sound so sweet, are instead used to imbue a maximum amount of annoying, fingernails-on-the-chalkboard, screechy and grating tonality to the music, as though the conductor were trying to force Vivaldi into the mold of angst-filled German \"sturm und drang\" music, making Vivaldi into high drama, or rather, inappropriate and almost dissonant melodrama.\n\nThe musicians are superb, which makes me angry that the interpretation of this music is so idiosyncratic and in a style that I regard as inappropriate for the music and musical period. Although others may disagree, the earnest, aggressive but ill-conceived performance ruins the music, in my view.","3188":"I have three other Carmina Burana CDs pretty much memorized to compare this to, and have seen it performed twice in different cities.\n\nThis CD is a DDD recording of Kurt Prestel conducting the Salzbur Choir and Orchestra...\n\nThe vocalists are mostly very good performers. They enunciate. They hit the right notes. Most of them are just about perfect. But the baritone is HORRIBLE. He has no strength or focus. There are two important parts during which HE CANNOT EVEN HOLD A NOTE!! He actually takes a breath where NO one else ever needs to.\n\nAnd the orchestra is small. There is no Gong during the last few seconds of O Fortuna, for example. And they sometimes sound like a High School Band. The musicians almost always hit the right notes, but they are clumsy at times, and the conductor just doesn't seem to get the feel for any of the music, or the work as a whole. The timing is way off. It's staccato too often, and way too deliberate, like a literal reading of music. It's just Not Magical OR Professional.\n\nTechnical Quality of Masters Classic CD from Holland\nThis DDD recording sounds hissy if you don't turn the treble down to -1, where most CDs sound best at +3 (on my car sound system). Plus some loud parts are very distorted. It actually gets much worse in the second half, which never happens on DDD recordings.\n\n* * *\n\nNow, if you'd like to know about the other two in my collection...\n\n* * *\n\nCarl Orff TRIONFI - Rundfunk Sinfonie Orcheter Leipzig\n\nThis is a 2 CD set of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana Trilogy.\n\nAfter Carmina Burana, the Catulli Carmina and Trionfo di Afrodite are quite disappointing performed by anyone, but worth hearing at least once. It's just that I cannot recommend this box set for the performance of Carmina Burana.\n\nThe vocalists and orchestra perform accurately, but...\n\n1. Several parts are sung much too fast.\n2. In a few parts there is so much R rolling that it is distracting.\n3. Too many parts are sung deliberately instead of joyfully.\n4. It sometimes sounds angry instead of magical.\n\nThe Technical Quality is OK. The highs are bright and clear, but there is hardly any bass, and really MUCH MORE DYNAMIC RANGE ON THIS CD THAN MOST CLASSICAL CDs. This CD goes from so quiet that you cannot hear it, to so loud that it hurts the ears much too often. And again, it does this Much More than Most Classical CDs!!\n\n* * *\n\nThe Philadelphia Orchestra, Eugene Ormandy ****\n\nMy favorite so far is not as bright and clean as the Ozawa, but is the best performance I have heard on CD. It is an older recording with The Philadelphia Orchestra led by Eugene Ormandy, and The Rutgers University Choir. Harve Presnell is the featured soloist in this performance, which is a claim to fame for my area since he went to Modesto High School. Also, if you watched The Pretender (1996-2000), he was Miss Parker's \"Daddy.\"\n\nThis was the best performance over all that I have heard on CD, but if you want the best sounding CD of Carmina Burana...\n\n* * *\n\nThe Berliner Philharmoniker, Seiji Ozawa ***\n\nSeiji Ozawa conducting the Berliner Philharmoniker is not the very best performance, but definitely the best sounding CD of Carmina Burana that I have heard. It's bright, deep, clean, and clear with full range and no distortion. It also doesn't get too quiet in the quiet parts, and then too loud in the loud parts. That never happens on this one. It just sounds fantastic.\n\nBut apparently others are even better. I'm going to get the highest rated one I can find.","3189":"This album has haunted my aural memory for a long time. This is the second copy my husband and I have owned---having given our first away to a very good friend. Galuppi is one of the marvels of Venetian baroque music, but his works have seldom been recorded well. Often, the harpsichord pieces sound too reverberant---possibly because of the conditions under which they are played and recorded. This Claves recording is marvelous in its balance; and the pieces performed are simply sublime.","3190":"Nowadays I rarely hear new Mozart but here is an occurrence: this is my first encounter with K 293, the unfinished Concerto for Oboe in F. Resident in the Fitzwilliam Museum, the autograph consists of 61 measures of its opening movement. The entire ritornello and first two bars of the soloist's entrance are fully instrumented. Thence, the oboe presses on alone for the remaining eleven bars before petering into silence. The instrumentation stipulates Violins, Violas, Bass, 2 Clarinets, 2 Bassoons, 2 Horns. Chronology-wise, here is one instance where K1 was right on the money.  Einstein's attempt to reclassify the fragment as K 416f was discredited by Tyson.\n\nThe music itself is a delight. It is less perky and more pastoral than K 314. Robert Levin - the defiler of K 297b - undertook this reconstruction. If one did not know better, one would assume that Mozart had completed the work. The cadenza itself is highly inventive. Bobby, if you're reading, the Australian Knappertsbusch Association has reduced the dollar figure on your Wanted Poster from ten to five bucks and a couple of Mars Bars.\n\nIngo Goritzki, the soloist, has a beautiful reedy tone. I invariably find Polish ensembles to be musical to their bootstraps: the Polish Chamber Philharmonic is no exception. To fill out the program, the Flute Concerto (K 313) & the Andante for the same instrument (K 315) are transcribed for oboe and successfully so. When added to K 314, this is a generous program, stylishy and vivaciously played. The Claves recording is excellent.\n\nThis is a winner.","3191":"I reallylike this song but could not download it on my computer because according to Amazon, I had to download a software on my computer that I did not want to do.","3192":"Marion is smooth with a mature and sensitive groove.

My copy is going right to the used-CD market, where maybe a listener less exacting than I will get some pleasure from it. From the first seconds, I was irritated. Jacques Parrenin, the violinist and leader of this ensemble, was associated a while ago with some decent recordings of Faure's chamber music. It seems he hasn't recorded anything else besides this Lalo, and it seems like justice. I now have terrific recordings of Lalo's first and third trios (by the Caecilian and Jean Martin trios)<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/French-Trios-Quartets-Debussy-Lalo-Faure-Ravel-Saint-Saens\/dp\/B000001K6P\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">French Trios & Quartets: Debussy, Lalo, Faure, Ravel, Saint-Saens<\/a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Lalo-Sonate-Op-12-Et-Trio-Op-26\/dp\/B0000AKOI7\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Lalo: Sonate Op. 12 Et Trio Op. 26<\/a>, so now the Parrenin goes back to the universe, where perhaps it will find a home more receptive than mine. As with all great music, and Lalo's trios are firmly in that category, one shouldn't waste time with sophomoric renderings. Traffic to this selection doesn't seem to be too intense, but whoever glances here should just keep on going.","3216":"What a disappointment!  I had so looked forward to having a clean version of the 1955 recording, and I thought that it would be worth the $32 splurge.  But this record, although it looks like the original Columbia 6 eye, sure doesn't sound like it.  It is mushy and lacks definition, just not right, just not beautiful.  I tried three different cartridges and 4 different styli.  I played it against the cassette I made 45 years ago from a friend's 1955 record; the cassette was noisy but far superior (and it was made with a mediocre turntable cartridge and stylus and a cheap cassette player).  I played it against the CD from A State of Wonder, that I never liked much; the CD was also far superior.  I don't know what they did wrong is engineering this record, but do not be deceived into thinking that it accurately portrays the 1955 recording.  It is in fact the worst version of the 1955 recording that I have heard.","3217":"Not the traditional version did not like.","3218":"The song its not the same as the one at the video I wish I would have known I woul have not bought it","3219":"I heard this artist on Pandora and immediately fell in love with his music. It is relaxing and at many times thoughtful. I always consider his music a treat. In fact, I haven't found a single song (on the three albums of his music that i own) that I have disliked.","3220":"This is I believe his sophomore release. What a great and beautiful CD it is. His cello sounds wonderful and is layered with other great instruments. If you have even listened to Olaflur Arnalds and enjoyed his work then buy this CD. If not still buy this CD wonderful music to inspire and chill out too.","3221":"great artistic work! very creative in terms of music, instruments and overall composition. good to hear any part of the day to just relax.\n\n999","3222":"Selected download and was billed for it and nowhere can I find the damn thing in my account. Billed for nothing. Thanks.","3223":"When I first heard this instrumental in my teens, I thought it was a new release by my favorites, The Shadows. A cousin who was the lead guitarist of an instrumental band and who played the tune note for note told me that it was by another English band called The Fentones. After getting the 45, I tried hard to learn how to play it but didn't nail the chorus until I can slow it down with my Vox JamVox four decades later! Always been a lousy guitar player, anyway! But I love this tune and always enjoy myself listening to it. I just wish it was recorded in stereo and that would have been great. It was released as a single in my country with \"Lover's Guitar\" on the B side. This tune was in turn covered and released as a single in a much, much better version that the original sounded amateurish. I've always wondered if the songwriter(Elleen Davies)ever heard this version. She would have been delighted as legions of Filipino players made the recording the standard of their guitar playing capabilities. The band that released that recording will forever be recognized as one of the best Filipino rock bands ever, if not the best. They were The Electromaniacs, led by Mr. Ernie Delgado who is widely looked up to as the best Filipino guitar player of his generation.\nThanks for reading this bit of nostalgia.","3224":"First fell in love with this composer when I saw \"Somewhere in Time\".  If you enjoy Rachmaninoff you will love this album.  Enuff said.","3225":"I don't remember this song, so it probably sucks.","3226":"This pop-rocky tune from the group 'I'm From Barcelona' reminds me a lot of the something from bygone days in the 80s, when I listened to groups like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/General-Public\/dp\/B00000DW9O\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">General Public<\/a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Men-At-Work\/dp\/B000088E77\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Men At Work<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Talking-Heads\/dp\/B000002L80\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Talking Heads<\/a>. It's got that positive \/ optimistic vibe that sets my toes `a tappin' and makes me want to sing or clap along. The main refrain sums it up best, \"Somewhere it's Summer, somewhere it's always Spring\".\n\nFrom&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Forever-Today\/dp\/B004REP30C\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Forever Today<\/a>, 'Always Spring' captures the feel of the band's 4th album, even if there a bit more variety to the rest of songs. It's not hard to imagine why when you consider the Swedish pop group has 29 members and quite a mix of instruments. If you want to listen to something a little bit different that makes you feel good, give 'I'm From Barcelona' a chance.\n\n~ Kort","3227":"This album was a live concert.  It had to many screaming in the background.  To many unknown songs not enough of the quality Haggard songs.","3228":"I was disappointed with it!","3229":"Woo hoo!\n\nI love this record.  \"On Dickel, on Daniels...  on Jameson's and Maker's...\"  Lovely stuff.","3230":"Just received as gift. It is in Spanish. Cannot recommend.","3231":"Track sounded fine, and was easy to download and use.","3232":"As advertised","3233":"Ummmm...wow. I saw this guy live in a rainstorm at the Mighty Mississippi Music Festival in Greenwood MS. The rain was coming down, the wind was coming up, and they had already shutdown the North Mississippi Allstars show at the Main stage because of the weather.\n\nWe're on a way back to our tent to ride the storm out...and in the distance, on the blues stage, this guy is just rippin' it up...soaked already, we take the detour...<lightening overhead>...\n\nIt is just us and about 25 other drenched fools and this band...this bass player, dancing like it is the end of days as he plays, a stern drummer keepin' it together and a keyboard player who knows his role and excels at it. Jarekus tapping his foot in a rain puddle on the stage next to a 4-socket extension cord. Rain steams off of his body in the heat of the stage lights. <lightening overhead>\n\nThis CD is great despite the shortcomings of the mix. Reflects the rise of the New Urban Blues (as I call it) also in view in Gary Clark Jr. and Eric Gales, and puts Jarekus Singleton squarely in that company of fine new blues talent.\n\nOur live show had no horn section and Jarekus carried the show in an impressive electric fashion. A fine player, song writer, singer, and someone to expect great things of in the future. <crash of thunder>\n\nBought this for $10 @ the show...peace.love.out.","3234":"I feel ripoff no music I love her book but this is is only her explaining the meditation no music at all","3235":"Excellent","3236":"I had the privilege to see the last performance of just the singer and him on a Rhodes piano singing these and other songs. This album had not been recorded as of yet - The singer was talking of just becoming a regular working guy and starting a family back in their hometown -such talent from God, I know he will find a way to use him well.","3237":"The greatest album I have ever listened to telling the most beautiful story ever. The album most be listened to as a whole to fullly appreciate it.","3238":"If you need some quiiet time of reflection, this is a great way to do it. Kim Caldwell voice is very soothing, the themes are very appropriate, the background music very relaxing. This will renew you and your soul. Enjoy.","3239":"This is actually a collection of Andrew Lloyd Webber songs sung by who knows who and not songs from Cabaret sung by WIlcox and Planer.","3240":"Love it","3241":"Sheer K has put out yet another song that evokes a full bouquet of feelings. I heartily recommend this song.","3242":"This album is great. Like Todd's other record, this is one simple and clean with some very good rhythms. Rainy Day, Whiskey Thunder, and Taking Back My Heart are a few of my favs.","3243":"Poorly Done.","3244":"This guy is not an artist.","3245":"The guy should never have made an album.  Hard to listen to. Could get through the whole song without turning it off.","3246":"love this <3","3247":"Beautiful","3248":"I collect shaped picture disc for their uniqueness . Usually the sound quality is not as great as a Audiophile album. These are mostly for collectors because they are limited and getting harder to find. The reason I gave this two stars is that the picture shows a nice white and clear version, where as I received a very dark and discolored version due to sunlight or improper storage. I buy these all the time on eBay and I always avoid the stained ones. This one is pretty stained.","3249":"The first one minute and forty seconds is instrumental.  One line of vocals is sung, then instrumental music continues until four minutes where another line of vocals is sung.  So out of over six minutes of music there are only two lines of vocals!\n\nI very much enjoy instrumental music but much of this song is uninspiring and repetitive.\n\nI'm assuming anyone purchasing this song is looking for both the beat and the vocals.  My recommendation is to buy one of the other mixes! (the \"Wide Boys Club Mix\" is very good)","3250":"This is an inspiring message. Though not my favorite Jesse Duplantis CD, it is a good one. The CD arrived in good time and in good condition.","3251":"I thought this song was going to be more interesting but it really sucks.","3252":"I had no idea this was a live concert. Very poor quality, it has great songs but they cant be appreciated.","3253":"I think its pointless to review the purchase of a song, you either like it or you dont. I'm a fan, love her music, great quality of the download itself, no problems purchasing.","3254":"I've always loved this style of music. If you love it too, you can't beat the price.","3255":"This isn't an album.  It's one track of fifteen that make up an album.","3256":"This was false advertising if you want the cool kids & groovy grown ups volume 1 like it is shown in the picture for purchase expect to be disappointed because it's the volume 2 version with completely different songs.","3257":"Great jazz rendition of the 1957 Theme song from A Summer Place Movie!","3258":"ok","3259":"For anyone who enjoys classic Juno Reactor stuff, like what was featured in the second Matrix (Reloaded) movie, this will be right up your alley without being much of anything new.  Deya Dova does add eye candy to the cover and some soul to Juno Reactor's driving techno beats, but there's not much of any meaning to what she's saying in this song.  Good tune.","3260":"Swiss melodic hard rock band \"Sahara Rain\" return in 2011 with their brand new second album \"Eternity\". The line up once again features lead singer Ricci Domenico, guitarist David Silhanek and Adrian Honegger, bassist Boet Haas and key-player Bo Rebsamen.\n\nIn comparison to its predecessor, \"Eternity\" retains the hard rock edge of the debut album while taking a considerable AOR turn. While their debut \"Sand in your hands\" drew upon German melodic hard rock, the new album comes close to the sound of Swiss melodic pioneers \"Gotthard\". For that matter, the production of the album as well as Ricci's vocals are the main points of reference for \"Gotthard\"s influence on their sound; in fact, \"Sahara rain\" will definitely bring \"Gotthard\" to the experienced fan's mind once they play \"Eternity\".\n\nFocusing onto the performances, it has to be said that `Sahara Rain's style had become substantially sophisticated; Yes, you once again get the thick riffs, the melodic guitar lines, the flawless rhythm section, and the harmonious shredding, only this time adding more keyboards into the mix. In fact, most songs are supported by piano that contributed both melodies and rhythm parts, becoming a large part of \"Sahara Rain\"s sound. Songs like \"Shout it out\", \"Miss you\", \"Will I ever be\", \"Live Earth\" and \"Starlight\" uncover the musical class of \"Sahara Rain\" hence making perfectly clear that the group have effectively raised their game with this second effort.\n\nHaving played the album a good number of times, I would go as far as saying that \"Sahara Rain\" are creatively in the same league as \"Gotthard\" on account of the music found on this second effort \"Eternity\". For fans of the Swiss\/German\/Danish hard rock scene, \"Sahara Rain-Eternity\" is one of the best albums out there, at them moment.","3261":"Amazon can't burn this one to a disc,they set the IMPOSSIBLE task to down load this album,my sansa mp3 player won't accept information site makes diwnloading to my computer equally impossible, damn shame its a classic album (oringinally released as \"Stagecoach Showcase\" not Sons of Jamacia.","3262":"Ugh","3263":"The biggest problem with a song like Nuestra is that it doesn't offer anything new or inventive to the table.  It is a tired and repetitive rock beat that continues to escalate into nothing special with some chanting and then it goes back to the same redundancy of the musicality, which is seriously lacking in depth and talent.  Now the actual album has gotten a few short raves from reviewers who happen to think this is a great album.  Maybe the album is better, but judging from this one song, I wouldn't give the album the time of day.  I'm certainly not impressed by this groups bottom feeding.  I mean, this song basically boils down to a group of loud men screaming over lackluster rock samples.\n\nMaybe if I get the entire album for free.","3264":"I think I got this with some free downloads. Yuk! Although it might be someone's kind of music, it sure wasn't mine and I deleted it from my list of good songs!","3265":"Was not able to download music after following all directions, also could not get online help.  Regardless of pricing, if you can't obtain the product you buy, it's worthless.","3266":"When you are relaxing in a hot bath, candle lights, bedtime, dinner, or what ever you like to do to relax, this piano music on low puts the finishing touches on relaxation.","3267":"Love it","3268":"love the song and loved that there were a variety of keys","3269":"Excellent product and incredible kindness from Kelindo staff.","3270":"Americana through the lens of seasoned twangy guitars and rich voices steeped in character. Jerry Lee Davidsen, Virginia Klemens and Alan Issacson hail from Chicago. Hank Yonda and Richard McNamee are from Seattle. Ten originals and 3 covers, great playing and great production. If you like Los Lobos, Etta James and Fender guitars, you'll love this. It's not country, not blues but something in between. This kind of playing and writing only comes from years in the trenches. Get you some!","3271":"This is one of Nancy Wilson's 1st recording on and independent label *ASI after her contract with Capitol Records was over.*circa 1981.

A GREAT BUY INDEED !!","3272":"I bought a song from this album, but my Kindle Fire 7 will not open it or download it. I love Can Atilla's music, but this time I'm just out the money. I wanted to buy the whole album, but if I can't listen to it... Oh well I guess Kindle's are cheap for a reason.","3273":"good tun","3274":"The intro with the cheesy rhymes is so bad the song just never recovers.  I guess they can't all be good.","3275":"I had this CD back in the day when it was released. Great band. Sad that the CD is out of print, but very happy to stumble upon here on Amazon.","3276":"Loved it","3277":"The Motivation single never downloaded. So I was not pleased. Money wasted. The song sounds good on the radio.  I will have to stick with itunes or purchase cd.","3278":"Daniel Johnson was one of the best gospel singers I've never heard of till I got this song....YOu need to ge this one.","3279":"it just doesn't sound that great honestly. She could do much better than this honestly. In some parts it sounds like something is wrong with her.\nDon't waste your money on THIS song. Her other are MUCH better.","3280":"I love this tune.  A great beat and so glad I found it on Amazon.  I listen to it all the time.","3281":"The most beautiful music to totally fall in love with Jesus all over again....Highly recommended...","3282":"Change in the song made it not a very good listen nor dance matraial.","3283":"Most remixes enhance the original song. Not this one. Atleast not for me. Downloaded without seriously checking it out. I went under the \"I really like this artist\" assumption, plus when a girl plays this song to you in the bedroom for the first time, it leaves an impression.","3284":"I thought this remix was the one with lil wayne but they all have lil wayne. Buy the original one. This remix sounds like your speakers are going out part way through. It's terrible!","3285":"An insipid attempt to not only promote the field she works in but also to exploit it to further her singing career. The lyrics could be read as a Hallmark thank you card. The promotional photos of her pretending to actually be in the mines, all dirty and proclaiming that coal mining is a \"dirty business,\" and the sexily clad \"coal turns me on\" tee shirts further warrant discrepancies in her integrity and hypocrisy as she is only an accountant for a coal mining company. I question  how genuine her motives are in this disappointing avenue..","3286":"This Looks like a great album, but I would not really know because every time I try to down an MP3 from Amazon there is always a problem.  I have not been able to get this one yet.  I am talking about these  problem going on for years.  There has never been a problem with Amazon's ability  to get my money!","3287":"Great song.","3288":"Cool","3289":"Great to find this. A treasure.","3290":"the editing of this piece is like scrambled eggs for thears .... when you ordered over easy! adds to the frustration not the mood.","3291":"Beer Party - But you knew that didn't you!","3292":"Fun easy jazz arrangements for a young band.","3293":"we love this song....","3294":"Very nice","3295":"30 years later and Ian's death is still so sad. Joy Division will have a permanent place in music history as one of those bands that we can't get enough of. Unfortunately, their catalog is limited but every song, especially this one, is stellar.","3296":"I have no words for this song but these: LOVE IT!!!!!","3297":"I picked this song especially because it really shows how a child can brave the most dangerous of situations when they believe in God. I hope that everyone can one day see that as well.","3298":"One of the best, easy to listen to self help books.  No overly big words to try to figure out what they mean.","3299":"Just four words: I LOVE THEIR MUSIC!!!!","3300":"I downloaded this item and it Sucks and was not worth the price! I guess this was not what I was looking for ?","3301":"The Wexford Carol is amazing in Gaelic.  Amazing to think this carol is almost 1,000 years old!  Still tells the story of the first Christmas more completely than any other carol.","3302":"This is a great song and is in Crystal clear quality. In fact almost all their song are good. I recommend you get heart of steel and flight of the bumblebees.","3303":"I like Tribe","3304":"Moralizing treacle. You'll want your time and money back.","3305":"Save your money....","3306":"This CD does not work on ANY of my CD players.  I do believe it isn't the original CD but  a duplicate.  It is worthless.","3307":"Record was new but HEAVILY warped.  Literally unplayable","3308":"While it serves its purpose, the narrator is monotone, boring, and well, just plain awful.  I can't wait for a new version of this with a much better narrator.","3309":"Great song as we all know but the original is many stars better and the vocal cords are just not hitting the notes in this live version","3310":"I have tried and tried with this album, due to so many positive words written about it in so many places.  But there really seems to be nothing here.  Grooveless monotony, awash in reverb and bong gurgles.  There is no funk to this dub, no rock to this pseudo-psychedelic haze.  This has been a real endurance test for me to listen to, and I'm finally giving up.","3311":"It contains his signature hit \"I Love\" and was the debut album for the song, but like Alice Cooper's \"School's Out\" album, the rest of the songs on it are mere album fillers and never made it off this album that I know of. If you like the \"I Love\" song, buy his compilation albums instead, unless you like collectors items and nostalgia.","3312":"There are 9 symphonies at 4 movements each, that should make 36 tracks, yet there are only 34 tracks. This compilation is missing the 4th movement of both the 5th and 6th symphonies. Why would anyone buy and incomplete collection?","3313":"perfect song to sit and watch a sunset smoke and think about a girl to. reminds of my younger days","3314":"Heavy British accent. Not for under 6 years!","3315":"My baby loves all the Stories. Good Sleeping Capsule for 5 years old. It has enough stories for many nights.","3316":"not as good as I thought it would be...","3317":"BORING!! Donated it!  I would be embarrassed to sell it.","3318":"one or two good songs only...not great","3319":"This is a great pipe band but I just wanted this single. It sounds like they had fun playing it. The high level of energy is uplifting. It's guaranteed to improve your mood. That doesn't happen too often for me. It's in a playlist of one.","3320":"Fake! This isn't hip hop!","3321":"DO not buy, fake artist not the real deal. This should be illegal to sell.","3322":"Not recommended for all ages...needs parent advisory listed, please.  I listened to the samples before buying and even the samples are not appropriate.","3323":"This mp3 is not the original songs it is covers. This seller is not promoting the right product no where does it say that these songs are remixes or remakes. FYI LISTEN TO THE SONGS BEFORE YOU BU!!!","3324":"Seeing as it says HIP HOP and the first song is by Black eyed Peas, it should have been a clue that this album was going to suck. Well, I was right. It DOES suck. And worse of all, it's a bunch of remade songs by some random people. I'd give it ZERO stars if I could.","3325":"This albumn is not done by the actual artists, it's a recreation by another group.  They don't sounds anywhere near the actual musicians. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!","3326":"This album sucks. All of the songs are re-recorded because whoever put it together was too cheap to buy the songs from the real artists. Do not buy it is a waste of money.","3327":"I FELT I HAD TO WRITE THIS REVIEW. BECAUSE OF READING ONE OF THE OTHER REVIEWS. YOU ARE SO WRONG RAY STEVENS SHOULD BE AT THE TOP OF HIS LIFE. IF YOU DON'T LIKE HIS SONGS THAN DON'T LOOK THEM UP. I FEEL HE IS JUST SAYING WHAT MOST OF US FEEL. AND I AM PROUD TO BE A FAN. AS FAR AS OBAMA'S HEALTHCARE. WHY SHOULD I PAY MY CHILDREN PAY FOR OTHERS TO HAVE BETTER HEALTH COVERAGE THAN I CAN AFFORD FOR MY FAMILY. WHY SHOULD INSUREANCE CO. HAVE A SAY IN HOW MY DOCTOR TREATS ME.

If you are conservative you will love it.","3329":"It is so sad thinking of someone you care about dying but her voice is so sweet.  Can't wait to hear more of her songs","3330":"This particular rendition just gives me life!!  It is very spiritually uplifting and ushers me into praise and worship!!","3331":"LOVE LOVE LOVE This CD. Great songs, great artist","3332":"like it","3333":"Love it....","3334":"Another great song from Los Cuates. This group continues to produce outstanding music. Some may not appreciate the content of their songs, but they cannot deny their songs capture the current times.","3335":"No clue who this guy is and if he is related to Freddie or not, but this is an obscene attempt at Queen music.  Do yourself a favor and don't even sample the tracks.  It's not worth the time you'll lose.","3336":"Love me some Ricky Dillard and New G.....get the project!","3337":"This song really gets the blood to boiling.  You need an exercise song, try this.  The Lord will not only turn your life around, but Ricky Dillard and New G will turn that body of yours around with this medlody.","3338":"I wasn't all that impressed. It didn't seem to be what I was looking for.","3339":"Not the nice waterfall sound it claimed to have.","3340":"music is chopped up. it does not give you the relaxation you are looking for. It sounds more like raging river.","3341":"Another TRUE country sound","3342":"Sorry excuse for music.","3343":"Personally, i love the song - it reminds me of growing up in a rural area and brings back both good and bad memories.","3344":"this guy rocks...sooooo hard. yup yup yup.  did i mention this rocks soooooo hard. oh, i did. well i meant it.","3345":"Great mix! Keith is cooler than hell","3346":"Love the Lavern and Shirley theme song.","3347":"Good song about being down on your luck.","3348":"Love his music","3349":"Love live performances? This is a good one!","3350":"I needed the B.I.G mix","3351":"Shelly Fairchild released a great album, \"Ride,\" a few years ago. She is now back with a new rock band called \"Ruby's Money\" and she is better than ever! This is a GREAT song...download it now!","3352":"cool","3353":"Still sounds good","3354":"Best record of the rock era! And the flip side is good, too. This 45 from 1963 was in pretty good condition, both sides are in playable condition. I'm pleased.","3355":"It'a good and inspiring work.","3356":"I heard Isaac Air Freight back in the late 70's or early 80's and I thought, not only are they funny, but it's something I can share with anyone, because their material is clean and wholesome. This, unfortunately, is not always the case with other music and\/or comedy media. Thank God for Christian entertainers who care about providing family entertainment. This was funny then, and funny now.","3357":"British Military Band music played by a British military band.","3358":"I love this album, music is very powerful and moving. Gives you a deeper connection to God. Praise to Yeshua","3359":"I had the privilege of seeing him perform in NYC, years ago, the headliner was Dave Koz. I had never heard of Phil before then, but doubts turned to Praise once he opened his mouth. What a voice, my favorite is \"Call Me\", and you also will love his version of \"By the type I get to Phoenix\".\n\nLove you Phil.","3360":"Inspired by the folk song \"Maid in Bedlam\" this is a beautiful movement in Holst 2nd Suite in F major.  Gorgeous performance.","3361":"Ha! what a hoot! and oldie but goodie for Christian comedy. you can take scripts out of this CD and use for youth group skits. it is fun with the Son. :)","3362":"There are only like 4 actual songs on this album and 10 interludes\/skits.  Most of the skits are seemingly random movie quotes.  I don't know if he is going for a pseudo Jay Electronica thing with the movie quotes, but for such a talented rapper he is way off base with this CD which features him rapping for maybe a combined 10 minutes.  I would recommend buying Blu & Exile's 'Beneath the Heavens' which is one of the best underground CDs ever and paying 99 cents for the track Amnesia on iTunes.","3363":"Great music for gathering, reading your bible or just pure enjoyment. This is jazz that glorifies the Lord with every single measure!","3364":"The first not so great UNKLE album.  Compared to their earlier work, there is a noticeable change on this one.","3365":"Beautiful piece of music.","3366":"Great song...used it at my Wedding! Very unique and beautiful !","3367":"My mom bought me the \"Doc Hollywood\" sountrack years ago because that is where I first heard this song but it wasn't on the soundtrack. I was very excited to find it on Amazon. It is my go to feel good theme song.","3368":"This song is fun, a classic early '90s song. Nothing deep about it, and it's pretty self-centered. It may be annoyingly catchy. The sound quality is not particularly high, but it is over twenty years old. It'd be a great song for a '90s party--even if you didn't know the song then, you'll instantly recognize the time period influence.","3369":"Cons: it was only a portion of the song. I wish i could get my money back.\nPros: it was the song i was atleast looking for.","3370":"If you're looking for great music, look no further. Sylvan Street is one of the up-and-coming bands in the world of jazz fusion and they've gotten to that place for a reason. This music is hot and the fast songs really make you want to swing. Featuring incredible soloists on nearly every track, Here in America is the perfect album for anyone looking to enjoy the future of jazz fusion.","3371":"This is a fantastic ep, I've listened to it through about 10 times already. I can't wait to hear more from this awesome new band!","3372":"Not worth the price: this digital download was free! I'd like to smash the person who chose to advertise this track.","3373":"Enjoying this cd purchased, and surprised of the low price. This is far the best LoneStar cd vocally that i have purchased.  Great Cd but wish there were more songs to hear.","3374":"This compilation is some of Lonestar's best songs, but the lead singer on these versions of the music is not Richie McDonald, whose voice made these hits what they are. While I appreciate the low price point on the album, I wouldn't recommend it for a true fan of Lonestar's music.","3375":"Bought as a gift...  I am sure the receiver liked it (?)","3376":"Love this song! What a beautiful soft & gentle praise & worship song, very good to play with prayer & bible study.","3377":"In my opinion this is the best song of the Album.  It is very upbeat & reminds me of Vertigo from U2.  I only hope this song is released as a single\/it has the potential to top the charts.  It is a very different sound for Mana and It could be played in night clubs as it has a dance beat to it.  This song takes the pop out of Mana and will stay in your mind while making u sing it over and over.

While listening to this excellent example, I finally learned to sing it as I would wish to do whenever hearing it in the past.

For this 1965 LP, sung entirely in Nabors nasal Gomer Pyle voice, his singing and comedy came together. With songs written by the legendary Billy Edd Wheeler, John Loudermilk and Roger Miller, the material is several cuts above the typical TV star cash-in, and with Nabors twin talents as a vocalist and comedian, the results are funny, entertaining and endearing. Like any comedy album, its not likely to get spun as frequently as a straight music album, but youll be surprised at how quickly youll be singing along, and if you have kids, they may just love the tongue-twisting Hoo How, What Now? and the corny rock n roll of Heart Insurance. [2017 Hyperbolium]","3391":"Boy was I surprised when I started playing this and it turned out to be trace adkins what a surprise","3392":"Here is Jim Nabors singing in the  character of Gomer Pyle. Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. was one of the first shows I watched as a child. Many shows just lose their appeal as one grows older. This is one of the rare shows that is still entertaining now, as it was 40 plus years ago. Thats the sign of an excellent show. This album was advertised on the back of the record envelope of an early Nabors album originally issued in 1966. Hilarious music and highly reccomended","3393":"not many songs on it that I like","3394":"Excellent experience","3395":"I had initially purchased this CD solely for the song \"Across the Miles\" that I had heard on Pandora radio. After listening to CD in its entirety, I fell in love with the way the voices blend and mesh in the good ole gospel tradition. As a HUGE fan of bluegrass music and its history, and this CD has quickly become a favorite in my collection. I will look for more CDs by Russell Moore and iird Tyme Out.","3396":"Classic song by Tanya Tucker. Was very popular in the 1970s. Worth a listen and maybe add to the collection.","3397":"I fell in love with a few songs from this band on Youtube, so i bought their first full length album, \"Ode to Sunshine\" which has become one of my favorite albums of all time. (On the short list with a few albums from Pink Floyd, Roger Waters, Foo Fighters,  etc).  Delta Spirit is both  old-school and new school: While they don't seem to be virtuosos on their instruments, the music they put together is unique and hits you right in the heart","3398":"This is not the same Lamb (Andrew Barlow and Lou Rhodes out of Manchester England) of the hit Gabriel, Gorecki and Cottonwool.\nThough disappointed and feeling foolish that I didn't know this was not from the duo (I thought there were industry rules that prevented bands using the same same with the same exact spelling); the music is good and I will give it a second or more listen","3399":"I love this song, it has a great club beat, but its the beat that is also the songs greatest flaws, its showcases how thin and kind of high his voice is, especially when compared to his sister, Brandy's. He still good but at times he struggles to be heard over the music especially since the uncredited background dancehall singer can be heard clearly. I think if a R&B version of this song with just Ray J would be better. But despite its flaws or maybe because of them I still think its a really good song and lets be honest on most club songs, the vocals aren't the main focus, and to this the song serves it purpose quite well.","3400":"Love it! :D","3401":"never received it!! had previous review for other songs but only noticed 17 at that time. now I see all these. just copy and paste the other review for everything cuz same comments apply :-(-\n\nhad forgotten I even ordered this until I started writing reviews for other purchases!! ugghhhh!!!  other songs this same comment. damn! since I don't remember them I most likely don't have a copy of the original order, where it was supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded!! ugghhhh!!!\n\nclose to $100 worth of music never received!!","3402":"Very good","3403":"I was skeptical of the almighty and great Skrillex making a song for a video game but after Wreck it Ralph and Bug Hunt the man can produced for an adult movie and probably make it sound good lol!!\nGreat game, Great song, by a Great producer...enough said","3404":"Vintage Lynch.

So, it is like \"Hooked on Classics.\" Except not even as good. The sound is almost \"8bit,\" the sound that comes out of pccket video games.\n\nThey use the name \"Bachbuster,\" but do not get confused with Don Dorsey's awesome Bach-on-synth album, \"Bachbusters.\" That is awesome. Dorsey throws a backing beat in there at a point or two, but his whole album is not \"Hooked On...\" Dorsey was or is an electronic music composer and arranger for Disney, and got really good  at electronic music scoring and production. So, he went and put out his own album, Bachbusters. He has probably been te only artist since Wendy Carlos and Isao Tomita to get broad attention for an album of classical music played on synthesizers. I think Bachbusters may have won a grammy. Dorsey had 2 more, as far as I know - 1 with Beethoven, and one a melange.\n\nSo, if you are gonna spend the money, I would say get Dorsey vs. this 8bit Hooked-On-Bach. But, for a lark, or who knows - exercise music? - you might want to try this album.","3408":"I'm not sure if i never got it, or if I'm technologically challenged, but i haven't gotten to listen to it yet!!

The source of the recordings is questionable, and not a penny goes to the artists, or their label.\n\nSince both of the recordings on this release are available, legitimately, as reissues on Collectors Choice Records, see:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/World-in-a-Seashell\/dp\/B000A7BB7O\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">World in a Seashell<\/a>\n\nand\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Good-Morning-StarShine\/dp\/B000A7HWK4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Good Morning StarShine<\/a>\n\nThere is no point in padding the pockets of bootleggers and getting this.

They had a haunting distinctive sound with influences from The Sisters of Mercy and slight touches of the Ramones here and there. I live in the USA and at that time their music wasn't available in the States so I contacted them in the year 2000 and Erik Sjlander, the guitarist, contacted me immediately. He helped me out big time, thank you Erik, and I ordered the 3 CDs they had out at the time (Mist of Avalon, Sleepless, and Here And After). In 2001 they released the CD titled Tears. It is after this that things in the band changed drastically. It wasn't until 2007 that another CD was put out titled The Mist of Avalon Limited. They no longer sounded like they did back in 2001 and earlier. Instead of the haunting vibe they morphed into a euro-pop rock sound.\n\nThe Dinya CD released in 2010 has all of the songs from The Mist of Avalon Limited CD plus 6 more songs. The CD isn't bad, but the sound is so different from their previous work I personally feel they shouldnt have used the Mist of Avalon band name when they released these last two CDs. The best song on the Dinya CD is Negri. That is the only song I like on this CD, whereas on all the previous CDs from 1998 to 2001 I like all of the songs. I attempted to contact Aram Yildiz the singer, but he did not respond. Im guessing he no longer looks at their Mist of Avalon web page anymore and has moved on to other musical interests.\n\nIn any case Dinya is a good CD if you're looking for a Euro-pop rock vibe, but if you're looking for the classic Mist of Avalon sound Id pass.","3420":"Buyer beware!\nIf you have already all past albums from NLC,\nyou don't need this one,\nbecause this is a COMPILATION of 18 previously old Songs!\nSonglist:\nThere's no way,coming home,you know him well,how many times,stay with me 'til the morning,as i walked out,look at me,parlez moi d'amour,i remember,a week in the life,love will have its way,love is,my love,what would i do,i walk on by,and then i saw you,oliver's song,it's for you.","3421":"I love Technomind's stuff, but this one sounds crude and disjointed. Maybe it's supposed to, but it distracts me. I'd highly recommend their \"Flow State\" album instead of this one. It is excellent.","3422":"Oddly, it does work. However, I can't listen to it for long stretches of time. I'm an author, so sometimes, what I need is noise that isn't entirely music, but I need something to drown out the ever barking dog three apartment buildings down. You know? The pulsing beat? It takes a second to get used to, but if I cut it off too soon, my brain says, \"WHAT?! Turn that back on!\"\n\nThe writing doesn't happen right away. It takes about a minute, but then? Get out of the way. The keyboard is on fire!\n\nInteresting...and odd.","3423":"The music is good. I used this for background in a video. It would also work really well for fighting or adventuring music for table top RPGs.","3424":"I love Saul Williams, but was not feeling this cd.","3425":"I've been following this guy since the movie SLAM, and have loved most of his work as it evolves and mutates.  I love Saul, and I thought his first album was the strongest, next I thought the trent reznor's collab album was rocking as well.  But this?  what the hell is this?  A bunch of pop - poppycock. Wake up. Get back to your rootz.  Revolution of the mind.","3426":"This single is a very good single. I love it.","3427":"love this song, but very expensive for a single! I anticipated more than just the radio edit and acoustic version of one single. This is NOT an entire CD, so do not buy if that is what you are looking for!","3428":"I really did NOT enjoy the way this man sounds. This guy sounds awful! I would not recommend buying this crap!","3429":"This is a great collection of Celtic songs with plenty of upbeat, toe-tapping tunes. When my daughter heard it, she said it made her want to get up and dance a jig! Perfect for lowering your blood pressure and facilitating the release of endorphins. And better than coffee to wake you up in the morning. I wish they had liner notes, though. Maybe they have liner notes on the CD version but I bought the MP3 download and it didn't include any notes about the songs or the performers.","3430":"This is a traditional Irish music band. They have solid sounds and the voices are deep and melodious. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Irish music! Let your self be entertained and soothed.","3431":"Small Town Girl by Kimmie Rhodes is about as bad a CD one can buy.  On any given CD, I can find at least one song, which makes the CD worth purchasing.  That is not the case with \"small Town Girl\"  - - this album does not do Kimmie Rhodes justice and detracts from her other fine albums.  Don't buy - save your money.  David Herbert PS:  I think Amazon should offer refunds or credits","3432":"I don't like the music, and the beat isn't consistent","3433":"The CD is awful.  Some songs are very loud; some are soft; you can tell it was copied from other CD's.  After about the fourth song there's a terrible screech in it, as if, in the past when we had records, someone pushed the needle on the record.  I'm afraid it's going to break my stereo; listened to it twice and I will throw it away.","3434":"Threw it in the trash.  The songs were barely recognizable. Track 12, Staying Alive by the Bee Gees was sung in Black Rap fashion and track 13, I Love Rock and Roll was sung by a man to another man (17years old).  Sorry, but not what I was expecting and not my cup of tea.","3435":"just ok","3436":"Didn't know these were not the original bands! That should be stated clearly before purchase.","3437":"Love it! Found myself dancing on my walk!","3438":"A great take on a genuine classic.  Nothin but electro-glitz and glamour here.  Fun, fun, fun!","3439":"Outstanding talent and professional presentation - he will be greatly missed. In my opinion, this \"The Gift\" is one of his very best presentations. He left an awesome legacy of his music to be enjoyed for years. I can listen to his music all day and never tire of it.","3440":"This item don't have a OBI, only a tshirt and two cds, but don't are from tailandia o malasya... is a lie, sorry for my english","3441":"Not my kind of music, bought it by mistake.","3442":"Very tuneful, smooth voice. Good delivery and diction. I love to listen to singers with melodic voices who can actually be understood when they sing. I highly recommend this CD.","3443":"The pictures lead you to believe that these tracks are from original artists.  Please do not be fooled and waste your money.  The original versions are much better and full of life.  These are boring and horrible vocals.  I sampled 3 tracks just to make sure.  FAKE FAKE FAKE.  I am a collector of remixes and original mixes of 80's music and can tell right away.","3444":"I've always liked Trick Pony and was disappointed when the group split up.

The audio quality on most of the tracks is good although a few of the (earlier?) recordings are muddy.  Well worth it.","3448":"Horrible sound quality--his voice sounds like it were recorded while a coffee cup hung on the microphone.  I had to get a refund.","3449":"Heard this on siriusxm. Can't believe I missed this group. Excellent song and performace. This is better than the carniege show. Either way, a group that still requires attention.","3450":"Superb music, a masterpiece","3451":"Someone should get this","3452":"This title means \"Hour of the Wolf\" and is about\nthat hour before dawn when the Wolf howls and humans\npull the covers over their heads and wait until dawn.\nBeautiful, haunting.  I love wolves by the way.","3453":"I have owned this album for years and the music is simply beautiful.  If you're not familiar with Puccini's operas, listen to this arrangement of some of the most emotional music ever written and I'll bet you'll want to hear them in their original form i.e., sung).

Fans of the Jaynetts, and lovers of the girl group sound will like this the most.","3462":"This is part of the Impulse 'New Wave' series issued in the sixties to showcase the new world of jazz post-big band. It was one of 4 albums I needed to fill out my set of A-1 through A-100 (A-41). As usual, Paul Gonsalves does not disappoint. Cleo definately has the groove and loved it. He is one of the giants from his work with Ellington (Wow, those who know remember \"Live at Newport', his collaborations with Sonny Stitt and sooooo much more. Definately a keeper.","3463":"Beautiful  song","3464":"I've watched this talented singer, songwriter, guitarist\/pianist blossom over the past few years, from ingnue to troubadour to exciting, mature artist. \"Winning Hand,\" Sheri Miller's new CD, packs an emotional wallop to go along with its tuneful, impeccably produced music. I liken Sheri to my favorite female singer\/songwriter, Karla Bonoff, in her fearless ability to range from the precincts of despair (\"Guarded, so brokenhearted\/I kept the world at bay\") to the pinnacle of joy (\"Love, Love, Love, Love\"). It isn't easy to channel your inner self this forthrightly, and this nakedness adds depth to \"Winning Hand's\" hit-potential pop-rock (\"Spoons,\" \"Everybody Feels This Way Sometimes\"). With this lovely, assured CD, Sheri Miller is pushing all her chips in on the river card. I wouldn't bet against her, if I were you!","3465":"This is a great, catchy song, that came from a popular YouTube video.  It's a Miley Cyrus take-off (pre-twerking, but very much post-Disney Miley) that also used video footage from Snoop Dogg (pre-Snoop Lion, I think).  The lyrics are less interesting than some of BLR's other work, but otherwise very much inline with what BLR usually does:  goofy, crass, but catchy.  However, the beat is one of BLR's best and the weird impression of Snoop is pretty great in its own way.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Bad Lip Readings (\"BLR\"), the idea is that the author, who can read lips, used to joke with friends that people looked like they were saying ridiculous things if you were only mediocre at reading lips (or if you were joking around and trying to misread what they were actually saying).\n\nThe BLR author took that concept and ran with it, making various political, movie, and music videos where he used actual footage from politicians, movie scenes, and music videos.  For music videos, the BLR author would also make a new musical track and do his own impressions of the artist (or maybe he has friends do the impressions, I don't know).  However, in place of the real words of the song, the BLR author added goofy words that either made little to no sense but were amusing (like this song's lyric \"Tiny Timmy Tokyo\" or the song \"Shoot a Russian Unicorn\") or were otherwise just ridiculous (like the line \"Let's buy two industrial windmills\" from this song, or \"You slapped a fiiiiish\" from a Twilight BLR).  The BLR replacement words are generally very entertaining, and the impressions sound pretty good but still have their own interesting style.\n\nHowever, a funny thing happened when he was making the goofy music videos:  they turned out to be really good songs on their own.  The beats are impressive, the tunes are fun, and the tracks overall are very catchy.  So while you would probably be fairly confused if you heard this song without knowing what it was, you might still find yourself singing it later.\n\nI highly recommend BLR's songs to others.  They're fun, catchy, and worth a listen.  I can only hope that, like Weird Al's stuff, BLR can work with authors and create more great BLR music videos.  (At least some artists, like Michael Bubl, think what he did with their songs is hiliariousBubl has a YouTube response praising the BLR \"Shoot a Russian Unicorn.\")","3466":"This is a great album.  I play it in the car, and at night, really I listen to this a lot.  My kids seem to relax and trip out on the many amazing tin whistle melodies.  I'm not an expert in Irish music, but to me this sounds like a cool fusion of Irish music with a sort of modern flare that makes me actually stay awake and become energetic.  Some of my other tin whistle music makes me snooze.  I highly recommend this album!","3467":"None of the songs in this order will download to my library!! I'm super pissed!!! I even tried to buy some of the album's and they downloaded every song Accept for the songs in this order!! I want my money back !!!!","3468":"I enjoyed this album so much that I bought it again off Jim's band camp. It feels oldschool, but new at the same time. The game that wasn't a game that this music plays in fits perfectly. The colors and setting are completely in sync with what you are hearing. You don't even need to have played the game in order to enjoy this album.","3469":"Like so many offbeat or experimental bands, each successive release by Gang Gang Dance finds them sporting a progressively accessible sound. \"Eye Contact,\" GGD's fourth proper album, is not only accessible, it's \"pleasant.\" Compared to their past work--even immediate predecessor \"Saint Dymphna\"--this is practically Easy Listening music for them; spacey synths undulating through leanly arranged melodic numbers, each track flowing perfectly into the next as if it were a Paul Oakenfold mix.\n\nIs this cause for panic amongst the GGD fan base? Hopefully not. While this one certainly is as smooth as a whale's tail, the spacey feel is closer to Cocteau Twins than Enya or Moby. And it's still inimitably, unabashedly, a Gang Gang Dance creation. As with past albums, percussion still takes precedence here, so \"Eye Contact\" is not some dippy trance mix; it has some great rhythms, from the crashing dubstep of \"MindKilla\" to the skittering \"Sacer\" to the thunderous stomp of \"Thru and Thru.\" And Lizzie Bougastos is as colorful a vocalist as ever, turning \"Adult Goth\" into a stoner-friendly Bollywood anthem. That may sound silly, but the song's beauty and emotional heft totally transcend any campy trappings such a reference might hold. Such is the power of Gang Gang Dance.\n\nThe seamless synthetic approach to the album's production does give \"Eye Contact\" a deceptive feeling of sameness, not to mention of fluffy superficiality. Subsequent listens, however, reveal the character behind each song. Admittedly, I was initially underwhelmed, but now I can't get enough. Similar to Stereolab's \"Dot and Loops,\" an impressive and ambitious album eventually comes out of hiding. Just give it a chance, let it get to know you.","3470":"Top notch military band.  Excellent selection of music.  It doesn't get any better than this CD.","3471":"Wish they were all as good as Boney.  This one still good to this day.","3472":"This adaptation is both funny and cool simultaneously. The overall sound is gorgeous.

But this is quite simply one of the best metal records for ages.\n\nThundering percussion, screaming power metal riffage and soaring solos meld the Ghibli tracks into an altogether unforgettable modern metal experience. They lose none of their melody and even keep a great deal of their original charm, helped in no small part by the dual male\/female vocal combination. The male vocals are low and gutteral but perfectly listenable, we're not talking nu-metal or screamo and the female vocals, lead on most tracks, are still very sweet, girlish and deliciously kawaii ^^ , riding beautifully over the metal roar.\n\nAnd what a roar it is, prime power metal straight from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Dragonforce\/dp\/B000FKO5DI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dragonforce<\/a>&nbsp;\/<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Helloween\/dp\/B001EKH094\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Helloween<\/a>&nbsp;\/<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/X-Japan\/dp\/B000RZGFIE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">X-Japan<\/a>&nbsp;school of rock.

Clearly, all the producers of this MP3 set did was nab a few, convert them to MP3, and post them for sale here. They didn't even bother to render the MIDIs in a half-decent soundfont! All you get here are monotonous, rigid computer renditions of the rags in a cheesy synthesized piano sound. Yuck! Who cares if it's cheap? The non-copyrighted source MIDI files are free and widely available. (Just use your search engine.) I love ragtime, and but rather than waste your money on this junk, look for CDs or MP3s of *real* performances by *real* human musicians: Max Morath, Joshua Rifkin, John Arpin, Guido Nielsen, Richard Dowling, Morten Gunnar Larsen, Trebor Tichenor, etc. There are plenty of talented musicians playing this music with much more feeling and passion. For decent performances you might not get 50 tracks for such a cheap price as this compilation, but you're much better off getting a dozen or two dozen really good performances than 50 lousy ones.

That's a heavyweight cast for an artist recording a debut album, but their judgement was good, and \"Deep Black Water\" is a super album of gothic Americana and indie folk songs. The title track is sheer perfection, but it's not alone. \"Like The Thunder\" is just beautiful, a haunting pedal steel guitar snakes around Brent's words, and \"Tell Be Sweet\" is a devastating love song. Fans of Jesse Sykes and Joanna Newsom should hunt a copy down.","3496":"so so","3497":"One of the worst songs I have ever heard.

Granada - Frankie Laine : Appears to be a re-record based on comparison to tracks available from iTunes. Quality is good with a couple glitches.\n2.

Sure, it's listenable, but Incubus has grown into a band that's far from what they founded themselves on. Ever since their bassist left the band it has just been a disaster.

I ended up downloading it from YouTube and converting it with the MP3 converter to get a clear copy.  This is the second time I have purchased music from Amazon and got a scratchy distorted sounding song.  Will consider purchasing from them again if they fix this problem.","3525":"This new single had some promise and maybe I thought it was a slower picture of amazingness to come. How utterly wrong I was. I read some of the reviews around the internet and in many ways they're 100% correct. It's almost as if Incubus lost its way completely. Like someone got hit on the head, woke up famous and completely forgot how they got there. The new CD is laughable and nothing other than terrible and forgettable. After listening to the Foo Fighters new CD, I thought \"WOW! Bands can still make amazing music.\" Which only made this situation that much worse. Adolescent is the only song on the entire album that anywhere near resembles Incubus. Where's the unique turn tables mixed against hard charging guitar? This CD sounds like something my Mom would listen to (shes in her late 50s). It's boring, ambiguous and nothing Incubus. People say \"well they've matured! Their sound is different.\" There's a difference between maturing and changing who you are completely. Eminem has come into his own and \"matured\" his sound.....meaning he made it a better more confident rendition of who he is\/was. He didn't turn to Opera and claim it's him \"maturing.\"\n\nThere's no maturing to this album, if anything it's just a transition into a bad Coldplay\/U2 ballad cover band. They took five years off and forgot who they were. Brandon lost his edge...the band lost it's edge......they're no longer unique in literally any way, shape or form. Before I was worried Incubus would make a bad album.....now I'm concerned Incubus has just become a terrible band.","3526":"\"...I'm feeling overwhelmed, overwhelmed\nIt's getting out of line, line, line\nI know I'm not alone\nJust adolescents, you and I...\n\nFinding an Incubus song as one of Amazon's free downloads of the day was a pleasant surprise.

But what really has made it clear to me, is that when the cast does a cover song, it feels like they've taken the magic out of great songs that've been strong for others, and turned them into disgraces. That is the case with Misery, their latest song from Glee. Taking the upbeat delight from Maroon 5, and not really making it their own, hasn't been anything new to my ears. If you really want to be put out of misery, stick with the one from Maroon 5 instead.

It has been as heavily hyped as the sonata set itself. I own the sonata box set, and was disappointed with much of it. Here, I hoped for better from Lewis, but came away I am even more disappointed.\n\nThe Diabelli Variations are among the most difficult piano marathon\/obstacle courses in music, taxing and trying to performers and audiences alike, and capable of exposing many a pianists technical weaknesses as well as the deficiencies in interpretation and range of expression. Sadly, I don't think Lewis fared well.\n\nOn both this recording and the sonata cycle, I hear from Lewis:\n\n-Plushly upholstered, dull-edged Beethoven.\n-A big, thick, dark, heavy piano sound, that you will either like or not. I don't care for it. Lewis piano tuning (on a Steinway) and technique add to the effect.\n-An approach that uses a lot of rubato and extensive use of piano effects (and I think more pedal) than most, which adds to the sludgy thickness and heaviness.\n-Dull-edged centrist\/middle of the road interpretation and performance. Thoughtful to the point of being overthought, and at many times lost and meandering. Often boring. Better on lyrical and hushed passages, awkward on the rest. Lacking variety in character and expression.\n-Soft, rounded off legato phrasing. This is my main issue with Lewis. He resorts to slidy legato phrasing through much of the music, far beyond what is called for. Edges are blunted, rounded, and smoothed over---no chiseling, no pinpoint articulation. Musical lines, dynamics, accenting, and attacks are all rounded off and soft-edged (even when he is more forceful and aggressive).\n- Closely miked acoustic that is on the boomy side, further accentuating thickness, fuzziness, and heaviness.\n\nSome of Lewis playing is more boisterous on the Diabellis than on the sonatas, but this is not necessarily for the better. Both his performance and recorded sound strike me as heavy-handed and limited expressively. There is awkward lumbering in some passages where deftness and agility is demanded, meandering in others, and some passages where he is just leaden. Midrange and mushy, and at worst, almost unctuous.\n\nIm a fan of the approach that in theme and variations, the opening theme is usually something quaint, therefore it should either be performed relatively straight or tongue in cheek, to set the stage. Or it must be done with flair and attitude. Lewis does neither. He starts by bullrushing through it, and with legato, charmlessly. And then promptly, starting with the first set of variations that should boldly announce itself with attitude and wit, he is dull and leaden (and legato), and pretty much stays there for dozens more.\n\nI took issue with Lewis phrasing and rubato on the sonatas, and how too many of the movements seemed to be too similar in character, and here on the Diabellis, I hear much of the same again. Especially for this work, there has to be clear delineation and character in each movement, but it all sounds too alike. The fact that he runs many of the variations together without pause doesnt help matters. Things don't improve much as each variation passes by. More legato.\n\nLewis is better in the most hushed and quiet variations, but still manages to make these sound less than riveting. Most importantly, there is a lack of movement to movement connection---a point of view--- that is essential to maintaining a listeners focus all the way through this massive, tricky work. At times, Lewis seems to go off on tangents, lost in the woods. There are dead spots, including in the all-important final variations, where poignancy is required.\n\nIt did not take me long to lose interest in this performance.\n\nIt reminded me of Andrei Vieru's version, which was also big and (too) legato-edged.\n\nTo be fair, there are many recordings of the Diabellis that, for various reasons, also fall short. It is tough work to pull off. Some interpreters, including big names, also have a bad legato habit. So Lewis' version has a lot of unfortunate company.\n\nCompared to Lewis version, Piotr Anderszewskis 2000 recording of these same Diabelli Variations is a huge breath of fresh air that I turn to for relief. Anderszewskis idiosyncratic version is well known and appropriately viewed as a reference, so comparisons are inevitable. I hear far more fine detail, crispness, wit, depth and insight with Anderszewskis. Every variation is distinct and different, as they should be. More importantly, Anderszewski did a better job holding my attention through the entire work, while Lewis did not.\n\nBesides Anderszewski, there are good number of other performances of the Diabellis that I prefer, each with better energy, expressiveness and clarity. They include Filippo Gorini, Vladimir Feltsman, Ingrid Andsnes, Laurent Cabasso, Christian Leotta, Igor Levit, and Martin Helmchen among more recent recordings, and also Richter, John O'Conor, and Alfred Brendel (Lewis' mentor), just to name a few others. I like William Kinderman's recording, and there is a deluxe edition reissue that includes a lecture. Gorini, whose astounding Diabelli recording is in many ways what Lewis' should have been, is also a Brendel student. (Let's see what happens to him from here.) Pier Paolo Vincenzi's set on Brilliant Classics features both Beethoven's and the 51 other variations of other composers. So there are a lot of interesting alternatives to Lewis'.\n\nCan I recommend Paul Lewis version to anyone? If you like legato, a thick warm piano sound, and velvety dull-edged approachable Beethoven, Lewis might satisfy you.\n\nFor more jaded ears, who have heard a lot of the predecessors and expect the very highest and deepest in Beethoven, you may, as I do, find Lewiss Beethoven to be a frustrating mixed bag.","3565":"The live recording of the Diabelli Variations by Grigory Sokolov is amazing. It took me a long time to track down a recording of this work that I'm entirely satisfied with. I feel that Richter plays the Diabelli Variations far too quickly. Just listen to the last variation to see what I mean. The less said about Anderszewski the better.","3566":"Jorge y Marcela;\n\nEste es un excellente trabajo, mis respetos para uds. y todos los demas musicos participantes, Jorge, gracias por lo que muestras en tus teclados, me parece super buenisimo tu trabajo.\n\nMarcela, tu voz es super melodiosa y muy especial me gusta muchisimo todo lo que cantas en este projecto, mil felicidades!!\n\nPor ultimo, que orgullo que en Mexico haya Maestros de esta talla, son unicos!\n\nSigan haciendo su arte!","3567":"Made a mistake in purchasing this.\nNeed to complain to customer service.","3568":"Doesn't sound the same as the original.

My ears hurt from this washed up crackhead","3602":"It is in fact some crappy dance remix featuring some minimal sampling from the story.  I feel this is completely mislabeled and misleading.","3603":"SUPERB - Cant be explained the -TOTAL PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY!\n\nI got addicted to you ALL THE TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!I don't know!\nGot hard time to sleep.

It is much cheaper there.)","3606":"I purchased the wrong record.","3607":"Personally I like the original version of the song - this is a remix and I ended up deleting it from cloud and ordering the original","3608":"I wanted the instrumental version and got this awful recording.","3609":"Nice little collection of songs.  My 2-year old daughter likes to dance to these songs.  She loves the Five Little Monkeys series of books, so naturally the song is a nice complement to the books.  My wife is also a fan, and she especially likes Big Rock Candy Mountain.","3610":"Great music for little ones!  I bought it for my 4 month old granddaughter and we all enjoyed singing it to her.","3611":"I love one song call Someday Somehow.\n\nNot more I can say here, but have to listen for yourself, what you may think.","3612":"Wonderful, radiant, utterly musical performances.  We can only hope that a second volume will appear with Sonatas 6 through 9.","3613":"Unsettling. By the way if you don't like off kilter minimal techno with creeping drones and a sort of drunken confused reception (that is yours) then you will not like this. Masterfully done. Kawn and Too Far = standouts.","3614":"This song has alot to say to someone that may be making excuses for cheating because; that person may  also be insecure and causing another heart ache he can't deal with even though he\/she loves him.","3615":"Did not order this.","3616":"Very RARE Album but with not telling the customers that these are Not the original artists except the Very small print on the back of the cover is just unacceptable;","3617":"I found this program to not be helpful. I played and replayed this session and was unable to get to sleep. I am not impressed with this program.","3618":"It's easy: I loved the movie because I admire Pina but mainly because the music she chose in her works usually takes me to somewhere else - that's why I bought the soundtrack.\nOk, ok, I confess: I'm a soundtrack addicted.","3619":"How to understand Malcom X? Go to the source!\nEach of these speeches needs to be heard and taken alone with enough time for contemplation. Why? Playing these one after another will only stoke anger. Contemplation of MalcomX's and knowing the timeframe he gave these speeches gives one a sense of hope: When Malcom X gave these early speeches Kennedy hadn't set forth the road that would lead to Johnson's Civil Rights Acts. There was no hope. Water fountains were segregated to white and 'colored'. Bathrooms as well. We don't have them (as much) now but department stores such as Woolworth (think Walgreens and Target) had cafes where no 'colored' people were allowed to sit & have a (Starbucks) coffee with a croissant. These were not gang members wearing bandanas of a certain color and having tattoos on their faces scaring little children ->served today with a smile. These were women who might have worked on the NASA program that launched John Glenn into space & they couldn't order let alone sit and drink a cup of coffee let alone have lunch at these department stores in the south. In the north, where Malcom X was in Harlem, it was more subtle - with rents for apartments and pricing differences. Those were the times. Malcom X was aligned with Elijah Mohammed of the Nation of Islam after serving time in jail. He freely admits he was not a good person. It was the Muslim religion that saved him (in the late 50's). When he got out of prison he became the spokesman for the Harlem unit while Elijah Mohammed was out in Los Angeles. Tensions came between them as Malcom X became the more quoted, more sought after face of the Nation of Islam by the Main stream media & when there was a shooting of a Nation of Islam follower by white police, Malcom X wanted escalation where Elijah Mohammed did nothing & According to the Smithsonian special \"The Lost Tapes - Malcom X\" 2018, this was the first crack in the relationship. In 1963 Elijah Mohammed does not want Malcom X involved with the civil rights movement. Too late. Its already happened. Next came the Kennedy assassination & Elijah Mohammed wanted nothing said. Malcom X was stopped by the press and asked about the shooting & whereas he said nothing about that he did speak to the press which got him a 90 day suspension from giving speeches. He tried to comply but again the press came and tried to confirm the 90 day suspension, Malcom X gave a glib answer and Elijiah Mohammed\/Nation of Islam extended the 90 days to which Malcom X decided to leave for his turn at Mecca. While there, he noted that many white people were also Muslim & it changed his thinking so that he came back, split up with Elijah Mohammed, started his own foundation and finally reached out to Martin Luther King Jr. who he had previously pilloried relentlessly for being too soft on his Ghandi like approach. In the end, Nation of Islam had had enough and three of their followers shot him at the beginning of one of his speeches. He was rushed to the hospital where he died. If you want to hear his own thoughts (EARLY in his own development of what it means for the human condition as these were prior to his trip to Mecca and his full conversion to Sunni Muslim belief of inclusion) verbalized then this source is 100% optimal and can't be matched by text.","3620":"Wow what a voice!  I think Mr Pugh is a terrific singer and I enjoy the music.  Thank you!","3621":"I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CD FOR ANY0NE.

Need my money back.","3625":"Along with Vince Guaraldi's A Charlie Brown Christmas and A Boy Named Charlie Brown, this is the other album I turn to when it comes to introducing children to the world of jazz. The joy and delight on their faces when they connect what they're hearing with the movies they've seen is worth the price of admission alone.\n\nNice to see this new edition is print. The bonus cd with extra tracks is pretty interesting, as well.","3626":"i hate your sampling procedures","3627":"I'd never even known about this song or Luke singing on this song until I stumbled over it on Amazon. And I'm a Luke fan! Its very easy to pick him out in the chorus. Apart from his vocals on this, its a very forgettable song by a forgettable singer. Its only when Luke comes in that the lyrics get given some life. And I'd say that even if I didn't like him. Kind of wish he'd have done the whole thing.","3628":"This is a classic, taking me back to my teenage years.  I had this album stolen in 1964 and was never able to replace it in vinyl.  It reminds me of a manner of singing that no longer seems to exist.","3629":"awful  accidently ordered 2 neither played one blank the other skipped was sent a replacement that skipped to and didn't play sent back 2 cds was reimbursed for one","3630":"Don't like had to buy for work","3631":"A great traditional Cajun performers.  This jambalaya version is a good French version.","3632":"Ripped off..wont download or play.","3633":"Seven minutes that sets the perfect tone and attitude for the day.","3634":"I was a little disappointed....lots of \"what are you grateful for\" and pauses. Birds chirping, deep male voice, not particularly inspiring to me....only 99 cents. I has hoping for some more positive statements or something, a slower more relaxing voice.","3635":"I love listening to this in the morning.  It's only 7 minutes long and it gives me a chance to sit and start my day on a happier note.  Taking just a few minutes to think about all of the great things I really have in my life gives me time to be thankful and happy.

It's kind of a departure from the rest of the album, which doesn't rely as much on dissonance.  Of course, this sort of song symbolizes why Of Montreal is so interesting in the first place.  If I ask you what kind of music you listen to, and you say, \"I really love Of Montreal,\" then I actually have no idea whether we have similar tastes in music.  Because while I didn't really enjoy this song, I would be happy to listen to \"Requiem for O.M.M. 2\" on every significant road trip I take for the rest of my life.\n\nMy review here is intended to reflect my opinion, but I hope this won't dissuade you from at least giving this track a try.  And if you try it and don't love it, then please don't let that dissuade you from listening to some other songs in Of Montreal's body of work (some of their more popular tracks include \"Fugitive Air,\" \"Gronlandic Edit,\" and \"Wrath Pinned to the Mist and Other Games\").","3649":"To say of Montreal is my favorite band is a gross understatement. Their music can be passionately exciting and transcendent. It wasn't always this way--their early albums, apart from Cherry Peel, are just exercises in absurdity--but Kevin Barnes' creativity and talent just keeps improving and changing over time. Yet for some unknown reason he feels like he has to release these mediocre EPs. If you've never heard of Montreal, don't base your opinion on these tracks!","3650":"I was expecting something profound based on the lyrics, but from there it went downhill fast. It's just noise with a drum beat. Rather dissonant and annoying, actually. While it might make a great audio accompaniment to something, by itself I couldn't stand it.\n\nIf you'd enjoy listening to an album full of stapler sounds, this might appeal to you. If not, you might want to avoid this one.","3651":"Take some dissonant music box tones, add some space ship noises, throw in some dungeon doors and set the reverb to high, scatter sporadic helpings of feedback, place in a blender and set to liquify. Pour into a bowl of art form and add gibberish and a drum beat.  This dish is not only not-for-everyone, it caters to the select few.","3652":"Excellent condition","3653":"I don't know why, but I adore this song. I guess it's just that it appeals to my dark side.","3654":"D3 SIDE ONE:\n1. Frank Sinatra - That Old Black Magic\n2. Benny Goodman & His Quartet - Moonglow\n3.

Kept it as it's too much bother to return, and wasn't too impressed.","3656":"Find an earlier version. This one sucks.","3657":"This mp3 that I purchased does not play in Media player","3658":"This was only one Cd and is totally different to what is advertised. I bought this on two different occasions with the same results; not a Time Life Disco Fever and only one CD.","3659":"this shows a 12 cd collection,but I was only sent one cd !!!!!!~ this was not any thing but false advertising!","3660":"Not the quality I was looking for.  It sounded like elevator music to me.  Also, I would like a true sound, not artifical sounding","3661":"All right, I do not recommend for people who like Daft Punk and fall out boy","3662":"Game covers aren't a rarity (just check out OCRemix.org), but high quality, faithful interpretations of game music are few and far between.  So often they go into the realms of badly cheesy and terribly modulated synth, in the expectation that, since it's better than a triangle, two squares and a noise channel, it's \"good\", and since gamers are a goofy bunch, we'll love goofy renditions.\n\nProject X doesn't fall into either of these traps; the challenges posed by the skeletal framework of good instrumental music provided by the Mega Man 2 soundtrack are taken seriously in this album.\n\nOne of my favorites, \"Crash Man\", invokes a futuristic funk that was totally not present in the orignal, but is both completely compatible with it, with a crunchiness that helps recall the frustrations of that level in the game.  Even in the most synthy of the tracks, \"Metal Man\", the heavy \"wah\" effect used on the synth melody is carefully orchestrated to match the intonation of the tune.  \"Air Man\", another favorite, is brilliant in its simplicity - it uses synth more or less equivalent to the original, but adds a D&B track that reinvents the whole thing.\n\nI give this a four stars because while I love - LOVE - this album, I recognize that some of that is nostalgia for the game.  There is, however, so much more to it than just being a cover of an awesome game.\n\nIncidentally, this - as well as their earlier cover of Mega Man 3 - used to be available free online.  I was terribly disappointed when I couldn't find my copies and went looking to download, and found that the hosting location had died.  I'm very happy to see that not only is this album available again, but that the band found a way to get rewarded for having recorded it.\n\nHex Map: I'd love to see MM3 up here again as well; I know it wasn't as good a work, but it's still worth making available.","3663":"This is great music with a powerful message. Its nice to hear creative music with the message of hope . Its the kind of music you want to just lay on your bed with the window open and listen or listen to while driving on the back roads at night.","3664":"I like the beat of the music, but I did not realize the filthy contents in it.","3665":"Cool song when you're in the mood for it.","3666":"I only heard him on Spanish radio for years before I knew his name...but I fell in love with his voice and style..finally finding him on UTube.\nHe is from back in the day, but classics do not go out of style or season..Even though I do not understand most of what he sings, it does not seem to matter because he is so interesting in the way he does it.  : )  I now have a library of his material and enjoy it often.  Of Special interest on this album are \"Ding Dong,Ding Dong,esas cosas del Amor\" and \"O Quizos Simplemente la regale una Rosa\"","3667":"I'm a fan of Rihanna. I'm a fan of Britney. A Rihanna song featuring Britney should be amazing, right? Well, something got lost in translation, because this is not what I was expecting. Let's see what went wrong:\n\n-The song: S&M was not built for repetition, and as such was already a bit tired when this remix came out. Without any sort of change in beat, this seems like a loose use of the word 'remix'.\n\n-Britney: I always used to make excuses for Britney, but lately I've given up. She sounds like she has a cold while underwater, and that just doesn't sell this song at all. In fact, it takes all the sexiness (there wasn't a ton to begin with) and sucks it bare.\n\nHere's what went right:\n\n-Rihanna: The 'Na Na Na's don't seem to ever get old, and that growl she adds to certain bits is quite nice.\n\n-Britney: The fact that Britney is on a Rihanna song earns this two stars by default. Her delivery on certain lines is also pleasing, in a way that only Britney can sometimes deliver (see the pronunciation of 'hazy' on 'Hold It Against Me').\n\nIt's pretty obvious that this was a ploy to get S&M to number one on Billboard, and it worked. Both the song and this remix will likely fade and not be remembered amongst either of these women's greatest achievements. For now, it's kind of a nice novelty to hear on the radio, but that's it.","3668":"20 hurtz is better.","3669":"The one star rating is for the fact that they are charging for the price of a CD yet they are putting it out on a CD-R.","3670":"This was too much of a live version and I was looking for this song after a mime Video and would have liked the non-live version.","3671":"This album is for people with short attention spans. It is a single cd version of the two cd album \"These Hopeful Machines\". These abbreviated versions in some cases are very truncated and lose most of the impact of the tracks they are edited from. It's a shame, because the original versions in most cases are quite brilliantly constructed. If you are a BT fan, avoid this album and buy that one instead.","3672":"I picked up this album accidentally after listening to, and absolutely loving, 2010's \"These Hopeful Machines\". I immediately knew something was off when the first track jarringly jumps straight into a song. The transitions between songs, and within songs themselves, are terrible! Perhaps this album will sound good to someone who hasn't already listened to \"These Hopeful Machines\", but I hope people read this and other reviews and buy the right one!","3673":"Save your money. The tracks on this album are extreme over cooked with vocals and cliche riffs. I am disappointed because I have heard BT live with some amazing progressive works recently which i was hoping to hear on this album. This is not it.\n\nI feel as if BT is more concerned with getting the next big dance track hit. All the songs are misses.\n\nI like BT and his earlier works. However he is going in the wrong direction.\n\nSorry BT.","3674":"Huge disappointment.  I am able to promote the parent album (\"These Hopeful Machines\") to fellow audiophiles but casual listeners are not geared for 10 minute song arcs.  I was anticipating using this as a bridge.  Unfortunately \"Humble\" guts the first three songs.  Their mixes\/arrangements are baffling.  As tho someone imported MP3s and spliced them up in Garageband.  The transitions spike all over the place.  The remaining song tweaks are okay but many have the advantage of previous mixes.\n\nTo complain more specifically, if the original \"Emergency\" had its final 3 minutes faded out and its first 2 minutes mixed (properly) down to 30 seconds the nature of the song would have been retained.  That would have left it at about 6 minutes.\n\n\"The Emergency\" is my favorite song in ... years.  Past 5 at least.  The mix on \"Humble\" fails the song.  I will keep pointing others to the original.","3675":"Great Sound, good singer even in her earlier years. Thanks Amazon","3676":"It never download.","3677":"My kids Love to dance to this song!  They first heard it in the movie and now can dance whenever they want!","3678":"Tight drums & bass with a variety of instruments and some scratching. Smooth but crisp loud recording. If you like Dj Frane then you might like this.","3679":"I have never heard an Emmylou performance I didn't like.  Even so, Emmylou especially sings like an angel on this particular cut..","3680":"A complete miss on all counts. Color it bland. Every part of this CD was uninspired.  Most of the songs sound alike and that is not good. Dreary songwriting and an even drearier delivery. I am not sure if the horrible instrumentation hurt or helped the album by covering Emmylou's voice which was definitely not up to the level she is capable of.  I have been a fan for decades but lately Emmylou has become increasingly morose.","3681":"Fast and energetic. I love this song. Easily one of my favorite songs and I would recommend to anyone. Not really sure what to say about a song. If you like somewhat pop rock songs I'd say that's this song.","3682":"As a boy I owned all the LPs with the great music of Sam Spence.  Of course Autumn Thunder was like the Holy Grail when I found it. Naturally I was skeptical that Robidoux would measure up, and I wanted to wait a while and give him a chance; now, with so much of his music published, I think it is worthy of the tradition. For me this album is the best work he's done and the best work from this series, particularly the \"dynasty\" variations. I'm pleased his work is available and happy to add it to my NFL music collection. If you've always enjoyed NFL films, I think you'll find that while Robidoux can be overly cinematic at times, he can also do what Spence did: make me feel like I am listening to true NFL music at its best.","3683":"It not for me. I don't like it","3684":"the music sucks only got it because it was free","3685":"With all the sickening, unoriginal, garbage rap music that permeates the airwaves, one must ask why quality rap MUSIC and LYRICS like this are absent from the mainstream. It's pretty simple people. W e can keep buying the trash we are fed, or we can support artists like BIG REC and return Hip Hop to the glory of it's origins. As it stands, as long as the commercialized vomit that poses for real hip hop is all we buy, then w are the losers. This album is hot. the best I have heard in years from any artist. Keep bumpin'!","3686":"unbelievably washed up.","3687":"Terrible waste of money.","3688":"Terrible.  Not funny!","3689":"Wake me up when she says something funny...","3690":"Horrible","3691":"Not funny. Stupid. Vapid.","3692":"Amy Schumer's act is completely shock value. There is no getting around that. But she delivers it perfectly so it's hilarious. Her timing is perfect. The way she delivers the hidden punch line softly after the louder set up without pause is just perfect.\n\nIt's also REALLY dirty. So if you're an easily offended precious snowflake you might want to skip Amy Schumer. If you have no sense of humor you will not enjoy this at all. Her entire act is built around sex jokes, hardships of being a woman jokes, hating other women jokes, religious jokes, and ethnicity jokes. So pretty much every hot button topic that's liable to make easily offended people angry.\n\nAs for this album, one of the best things about it is that it doesn't need the video to make it funny. Some stand ups using facial expressions and body language has huge parts of their act, so the audio only version doesn't work as well. Amy Schumer's act works fine in an audio only version. The only exception is the very last joke on the album. She does something the audience can see that they apparently find hysterical, but the joke is completely lost with this audio only version. That's the only instance though.\n\nWhen she does her bit about how she's Jewish and a Christian tries to tell her about Jesus.......let me just say it's one of the funniest things I've ever heard in a stand up act. I don't want to spoil the punch line but it's in track 7. If you listen to nothing else....check that track out. It happens near the end of the track. Keep listening into track 8 as the bit continues.","3693":"I ordered this item and opened the packaging, put the record on the turn table and it skipped on three songs on side one.  I was so sad.  I returned it and had a replacement sent.  Tonight I went to put the new one on my turn table and IT SKIPS IN THE EXACT SAME SONGS!!!  I am heart broken.  Is anyone else having this problem?  Is this an issue with the printing or something?  I couldn't believe it, I have never had this happen with a new record before. Now I am totally obsessed with having this album on vinyl (been listening to the download and LOVE it!)\n\nWhat to do?","3694":"eh","3695":"Performance and original recording is 5 stars. This transfer from UMG is the worst. Do they listen? By the way this is the same transfer as iTunes.","3696":"Advertises that it contains the original artists, which deceptively leads the buyer to believe they are the original hit recordings when they are NOT. Very disappointing. I didn't pay much and the seller who shipped quickly is not to blame, but buyers beware of this album.","3697":"Excellent","3698":"A Nordic take on \"Over the Rainbow\"?  Who knew???  This is great, Rigmor sure knows how to sing!","3699":"I was shocked and happy to see that \"A New Shade Of Blue\" had finally come out on cd. Next to \"Total Eclipse\" released on Blue Note, this recording is my favorite of the Land - Hutcherson collaborations. The one star is definitely not for the music, but for the sound. Obviously, they had access to master tapes because they found an extra track that wasn't on the original LP. Either the master tapes were in bad shape or the remastering engineer just didn't know what he was doing. I don't mind tape hiss. It's part of the whole analogue domain, but Harold's tenor sounds rather grainy and you can hear wow, flutter and way too much tape hiss. Some of the tracks sound like the transfers were from cassette tapes. I know many of you hard core fans of this group are going to buy the cd because of the extra track (\"Dark Mood\"). It is a delightful track well worth checking out. Otherwise, buyer beware. I see on Amazon that there's another version of this same cd. I'm not sure if the sound is any better or if it's another knock off of the same thing. Your best bet is to search Ebay or Discogs for a LP copy. It sounds a 100 times better than this cd.","3700":"Don't waste your time or money.","3701":"Along with the Mass in b and the Passions, the Christmas Oratorio deserves to be one of Bach's best works. It demonstrates to me how intelligent he was musically in putting a piece (any piece of any genre) together, using particular instruments to add sensitivity and color. And so, 150 minutes go by with not one of boredom. Moreover, hardly any baroque composer can make you weep as Bach does.\nI am writing this because, after reading other reviews (some of which, sorry, are so absurd as to deem them inappropriate -- check the one star with the comment!) I have to strongly disagree with the appreciation of the solo singing. For that, I suppose you have to hear other versions; even the old ones fare better there. Specifically, I could barely stand the 'alto' of Michael Chance. He was not in good voice here. The high notes are dry and the lows cannot be controlled very well (I was screaming for a Janet Baker to appear). And: I DO NOT dislike countertenors, mind you. Pity. Maybe we have been spoiled in the last thirty years with outstanding countertenors?\nI did not find much outstanding in the other singers, Kooy (the bass) and Crook (the tenor) are solid and Schlick left me cold (this time). Given the year (1989) they were possibly starting their long Bach career and did better afterwards (as my vast Bach cantata collection shows).\nThe above notwithstanding, the rest is quite wonderful. Conductor, pacing, baroque orchestra, choir. Plus truly outstanding, state-of-the-art sound. For all that, there goes my 4-star count.","3702":"one of the most beautiful performances of the Christmas Oratorio!","3703":"I don't remember this song, so it probably sucks.","3704":"If I ever feel suicidal, this would be the song to push me over the edge. Droning, rhyming dictionary lyrics and no real feeling.","3705":"I was very disappointed to receive only 2.37 minutes of this lovely anthem. I feel cheated.  I sang this anthem many years ago with a choir a nd have been looking for it ever since. When I realized it was p art of the royal wedding I ordered it right aw ay. Just as it is getting going it stops.\n\nC.Ellis","3706":"By looking at other reviews, maybe I'm the only one whose disappointed.  After 2 1\/2 years, I was expecting something new and fresh. This is so generic.\n\nHoping this isn't indicative of the album.","3707":"This is my wedding song, just need the CD without lyrics so which one would that be?","3708":"This song tells the story of how I want my marriage to go!  Keep God first!","3709":"very good song","3710":"On one of the home alones and on the radio there is a version of \" Please come home for christmas\" this was a country version I guess it was not what I was looking for and I am still trying to find the right version.","3711":"I really like this prayer blessing. I'm glad there's a song like this that takes me into the presence of the Lord and reminds me of His goodness, mercy and grace to receive the promised blessing.","3712":"not full. sad. sell the ayah of quran, just like those people mentioned in quran who used to sell the word of god for some money\nATLEAST provide the whole surah for the money you take.","3713":"When I first heard Charles Wood, playing with a bluegrass band at a wedding reception, I thought he was just another bluegrass banjo picker, albeit a good one. Not until I heard this CD did I realize what a magnificent talent he is. Five-string pickers are a dime a dozen here in the Appalachians, but someone who can demonstrate the banjo's versatility as Charles does in this collection is a rare talent.  From The William Tell Overture to imitating the magic piano sound of Floyd Cramer, his adaptations of popular and classic ballads will keep you spellbound! If you like the banjo, and appreciate a true talent, you will certainly love this CD!","3714":"Two great albums so far; thoroughly enjoy both. Hope there are more CDs and maybe even a concert DVD in their future.","3715":"Blaze Foley has a one-of-a-kind voice and this is one of his finest. A great song sung by an awesome artist.","3716":"This is a fantastic rendition.","3717":"This is not the music of Teresa Brewer.  Somehow the music of Glenn Miller has been substituted for the Brewer songs.","3718":"Although the album is promoted as the Original London Cast West Side Story, it is not the entire musical, but only 4 songs. This is a major league ripoff.  Instead of a discount, these songs are FULL PRICE!  $.99 each - no discount at all!","3719":"ok","3720":"Some standouts that are well done, but for the most part there aren't many genuine \"alt country\" groups contributing to this album.  I bought this because the track line up is a literal \"best of\" collection for my favorite Stone's tracks, but aside from Sweet Virginia, Dear Doctor, You Got the Silver, Coming Down Again, and a few others, there isn't much of that genuine country blues groove or feel.  My favorite Stones song of all time, Torn and Frayed, sounds painfully awkward and robotic, completely missing that fantastic loose vibe and rich fullness of the original. Streets of Love made me wonder if I should have had a Care Bears backpack and Glow sticks with me before heading into the Rave that the covering artist plays.  Loving Cup sounds like it tried to be some sort of mix between the Exile version and the classic \"Drunk Version\" outtake from the Let It Bleed sessions, but without any semblance of blues or country to be found anywhere.\n\nI appreciate the attempt to put a different spin on these timeless gems, but the name of the album is a bit misleading.  This album is long on Alt, short on Country, and devoid of the blues influence lurking behind all good country music entirely.  The Deadstring Brothers, arguably the best Country Blues \"Stones Influenced\" group since the Black Crowes, are nowhere to be found on this album, which was sorely disappointing.\n\nWorth a shot, but don't get too excited.","3721":"Very original take on the Neil Young classic.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.","3722":"Didn't like this tune....","3723":"I lay down, I set up the handset and closed my eyes. Here's what happened.\nThis track, after a few minutes, he carried me through our solar system. I passed another planet so close that I could look at them carefully!","3724":"I bought this CD sometime in the early 90s and over the years I come back to it again and again. I love the atmosphere it creates. Very spiritual and deep.","3725":"Ms. Konkova does it again! Excellent performance! Refer to review of her other solo recording  'Improvisational Four'.","3726":"Chance the rapper selling his album for free..and these legends charging for songs too","3727":"superchunk at their weakest....for die-hard fans only!!","3728":"This album represents a turning point for the band. Long time 'chunk fans point to the lo-fi abandon of No Pocky for Kitty or Foolish as the pinnacle of Superchunk's impressive 15 year (and counting???) arc. However, for my money, this album combines the frenetic pogo hopping style (Hyper Enough comes to mind) of their early albums with the more hypnotic, pensive sound (Eastern Terminal) that will emerge on later albums. This is a strong album from start to finish, one that I return to time and time again. It's a great place to start your collection because the band's past and future are echoed so well.","3729":"I know most Superchunk fans consider their debut or \"No Pocky. . .\" the best in the band's catalog, but I disagree.  While their first two albums are great, they represent Superchunk as nothing more than a great garage\/punk band.  And that's not a bad thing.  But \"Here's Where The Strings Come In\" proves that Mac and the band are capable of more than just catchy, three-chord power punk.\n\n\"Silver Leaf and Snowy Tears\" starts with a mellow picking pattern and evolves into a driving rocker by the end.  \"Animated Airplanes Over Germany\" is easily one of the most complex songs the band has ever written.  I consider this album to be their peak and it does not get the attention it deserves.\n\nIf you want to dig deeper into the Superchunk catalog, beyond the immediately catchy tunes like \"Cool,\" and \"Throwing Things,\" pick up this album.  That's not to imply there aren't catchy tunes on this one, they're just not as obvious on first listen.\n\nIf you need an immediate hook, then the first track, \"Hyper Enough\" should do the trick.  But stick with the rest of the album.  These songs will grow on you quickly.","3730":"This came out in 1995.  Indoor living, from 1997 was their last of 5 great albums along with indicental music, foolish, no pocky for kitty and mouth to mouth.  This is the beginning of the slide to a generally more gentle sound.  They got declawed a bit.  Worse, they didn't write any of the real together, soaring, 2 guitar power songs here that they did on those 5 albums.  I'm glad I got virtually all their records.  Who knows, in 10 years when I'm 61 maybe I'll be more into this and their other late 90's\/2000's records, less fast, less powerful.  Though, on listening to this, none of the songs hit that great musical groove that 5 to 11 of their songs do on those 5 great albums.  Still, much better than a poke in the eye. chrisbct@hotmail.com","3731":"Cd came in blank. Very disappointed","3732":"Classical music  how can you go wrong..?  You can't....good stuff....","3733":"False advertising.  Where are the 300+ sounds?  There's only 95 and that's nowhere near 300.  Is 300+ a brand name?","3734":"I received this CD, a disc that was supposed to contain 'cartoon sounds' that I had planned to use behind a video project.  The disc I received was over packaged, IE:  overkill on the packaging.  Then I insert disc into computer, and the disc was BLANK.  THE DISC CONTAINED NO DATA!  It cost me over 8 bucks to mail back, and I have STILL NOT RECEIVED A REFUND!!!\n\nI AM A VERY DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER.  I WILL NOT BE ORDERING ANY MORE PRODUCTS FROM THIS SITE AGAIN.","3735":"Most of the songs being under or near 2 mins, this album is definitely a sign of the times and caters towards the attention span of the current generation. I don't know if thats good or not, but when you combine in the chaotic sounds of the track mixing, I can't tell what the hell is going on in the song.\n\nIt's not horrible, but am concerned where their true artistry lies with songs that are 2\/3 as long most albums created in the past 25 years. It just expresses to me that they may not be capable of thinking past 2 mins even when working as a group.","3736":"I was looking for some good upbeat music to play while I used my new rebounder.  The few songs that I listened to had a static like sound.  The songs all sounded pretty much the same to me.","3737":"Having played this concerto many times, I was impressed with the recording.  The soloist did an outstanding job.","3738":"Did I say \"WOW?\" This song was first accompanied with the \"dance Your Shoes Off\" video posted on Youtube. The video was\/is perhaps the single most inspiring video I've seen and I was absolutely jubilant when the music from the video showed up here for download! The video was fun, uplifting, encouraging, inspiring, God-glorifying and a whole bunch of other wonderful things I can't think of right now. I watched it repeatedly to hear this music and see the people. After watching the vid about 29,413 times (joking) I felt like I was friends with the people in Houston :-) The words\/lyrics to this song are beautiful. The music is beautiful.","3739":"Thought it was the movie song, but it's a remix.","3740":"I have all of JR's music. I remember hearing a song by him once and I really liked it. From then on his music really grew on me. I'm surprised he's not more well know.","3741":"While I have enjoyed the music of Ruth Barrett and Cyntia Smith for many years, the anti-transgender rhetoric of Ms. Barrett has seriously diminished my enjoyment of her music.","3742":"Some of the tracks on this album are quite nice.  But it's almost like half way through the album the pianist just gave up.  Most of center is just recycled tracks from other albums & it doesn't have a reverence.  And can someone please tell me how I'm supposed to use Knock Three Times for tendus?  It's all uneven phrases of 6s, 8s, & even 7s.  This album is barely usable & my students have actually started requesting I NOT use it!","3743":"Let's all nip this in the bud!  This childs mother must be stopped before this little girl ends up a hooker on Hollywood Blvd.!!!!","3744":"I've been listening to Prefuse 73 for years, I have Security Screenings, Preparations, Extinguished. I've loved every single one of his albums until now.\n\nOnly She Chapters is a complete letdown, it's too dreamy and random noises. I've always liked Prefuse 73 because of his ability to make actual songs, lets get one thing straight here in this album are not songs they're just meaningless NOISE. I want songs not white noise. Security Screenings, Preparations and One Word Extinguisher are Prefuse 73's best works because the songs aren't just noise, each one works to a new level, each song has meaning.\n\nAll I heard was noise in Only She Chapters.","3745":"8th release from this New York City based hip-hop producer-cum-experimental composer, aka\n  Scott Herren, who has also recorded as Savath & Savalas, Delarosa & Asora.  These are highly\n  detailed, fractured & rhythmic avant-psychedelic symphonies that mix a twisted sense of chaotic\n  melody with dissident, unconventional arrangements.  They are often dreamy & haunted,\n  bordering on bedlam, with otherworldly textures & progressions that are focused on the\n  processed female voice--with contributions from Zola Jesus, Shara Worden (My Brightest\n  Diamond), Angel Deradoorian (Dirty Projectors), Trish Keenan (Broadcast), and others.  It's a\n  scary\/stunning post-classical nightmare of manipulated siren songs.","3746":"Jimmy Sturr is excellent and this is His best song yet. He is obviously the master of \"The worlds Happiest music!\". His bandwork is crisp and driving, with an excellent choice for the singer. You can't get any better than this for \"Polka\" music!","3747":"Love it!!","3748":"Great album!! Addictive!!","3749":"Pretty much, the review title tells you what I think about this product. Maybe someday someone will release Just Released on CD for us to hear.","3750":"Disappointingly notey and unfocused. Once again, a young, unformed talent who shines in other circumstances is left to his own devices and meanders to negative effect. Just my opinion. The guy can play!!!!  The choice of instrumenrtation is very interesting as well.  I just think he has yet to form a real identity and, perhaps, edit himself a bit.  But that's me....","3751":"Keep your eye on this young man.  He's sophisticated beyond his years.  A superlative guitar player.","3752":"Found this to be truly extraordinary music. Very heartfelt. Complex, yet easily accessible. This was the first recording I had heard of Lage as a leader and its simply breath-taking! I had first heard him as accompanyist on Voyager with Eric Harland and would highly recommend that CD as well. They both reveal the new direction in contmporary jazz of group improvisation at its highest level. Right up there with Wayne Shorter and his current group. Different sound entirely, however. Shorter is hard-edged. Lage is mellower.","3753":"I ordered a CD and got a 45 record.","3754":"Overbearing piano accompaniment favored by recording balance.  Pedestrian, banal, derivative lyrics which too often seem to be based on the need to sustain rhyme schemes.  CD-R comes without liner notes.  Insert doesn't identify the singers for each track, some of whom perform credibly.  You have to go to Amazon's website to find out who's who.  And, for that matter, who's playing piano - Cronin himself?  How would anyone who wasn't at the Beechman on August 3, 2009 know?  Or care.","3755":"i like the music but when it downloaded it went into the amazon file instead of being abel to put it directly into my documents. I cannot figure out how to get it over into my documents and so I'm not able to copy it and several other choices onto a compilation disc.  Not happy with Amazon","3756":"I'd love to say this song is on my Cloud Player and that I love it, but something happened when I purchased it and I can't get it to load to the CP.\nI hate being computer challenged!! And I really what my purchase on my CP.","3757":"Lou Rhodes is an amazing talent. Her voice is just electric. Love her style and grace. Such a great combination of music and lyric's.","3758":"Love his voice his songs remind me of showtunes they are simple melodies that are relaxing to enjoy moment or two","3759":"Sounds very nice, good bass","3760":"Based on the sample and the description I thought this was a studio recording. I am not pleased with the song. It is a good song, but I am not interested in playing  a live recording at a party.","3761":"I heard this on Tune in on the IPhone and i went to see if he had more music on amazon.  This is some really good music very relaxing and peacful it really worth it!","3762":"Didn't work at all. Not soothing in any way. It was like they were trying to scare you into quiting. I feel like it was a HUGE waste of money.","3763":"ok","3764":"Not for me","3765":"ex husband hacked into account and ordered them. No idea how it is working.","3766":"Execellent album. I have no idea why this music was out of print for so long. Pena is a great singer and musician. You should pick up his other stuff as well. You won't be disappointed.","3767":"super","3768":"I first heard this on the Heineken Commercial and really got intrigued.....so I came to amazon and looked over all the \"Golden Age\" offerings by The Asteroid Galaxy Tour and really liked what I heard...this 5.05 recording SUCKS.... if it is supposed to be remixed to be un-listenable and un-understandable...we...the customers need to be warned.....the little bit of the sample are not a good offering of 99.9% of the recording offered, especially if you do not know the music very well.....\nPersonally I thought this was just a longer version with a weird intro..and being a psychedelic band that would be normal......but not this and it sucks....I hate to say.","3769":"Why is it whoever produces this crap insists on mixing in random noises from the audience?  It's annoying to get the crowd sounds at full volume during the song.  Please, it's live.  I get it.  I don't need you to crank up the hoots and hollers to get the full effect.","3770":"Shame on Amazon for not giving a warning about foul language. I am sorry if I am wrong, but I have searched the net for lyrics for Runner. I hear the word \"G..D...\" many times throughout the song. I downloaded the mp3 without knowing this.  There was no warning, now I am trying to get a refund. I like this band. The lead singer has a unique voice.  Why does she think this language is necessary?\nDoes Amazon think that their customers are ok with this language? I will have to somehow be more careful. Amazon, let tv advance the moral decline, don't help.","3771":"Asteroids Galaxy Tour is such a following for me. I love the lead singers raspy voice and the upbeat but melodious beats.","3772":"Really bad","3773":"When I see something that states it is a tribute to some of the greatest bands to come out of the fusion period I am expecting something that is worthy of that tittle.  This is nothing but smooth jazz fluff.  I see that even the players would not put their names on the CD, don't blame them I can't see why anyone would want to be associated with such a piece of garbage.","3774":"I never purchased this product.","3775":"Beautiful music, both the instrumentals and the vocals. I would love to know who the female vocalist is on Londonderry Prayer","3776":"This is one of my very favorite albums.  Purchased this Christmas for relatives to rave reviews.  Definitely worth purchasing!","3777":"Gave this to my pastor for a birthday gift and he absolutely loved it!  A combination of instrumental and octavos.","3778":"Beautiful voice. An unknown gem","3779":"I am training for a 15k to be followed by a half marathon the next month and I am very happy with this training music. I was initially skeptical about the pace but after trying it I found I ran a 12:05 mile.  I hope this helps me keep my timing well for my races.","3780":"I expected an entire album","3781":"I do not quite see the point of selling five minutes worth of Ralph Fiennes reading \"Kim\".  I thought $.99 was incredibly cheap, but then there are sometimes bargains to be had on Amazon.  The description listed the length if this audio file as 5:19 (or something like) minutes.  I could not tell if it meant five hours and 19 minutes, or five minutes and 19 seconds.  I decided to risk a buck. Just so everyone knows, it is the latter. This is only five minutes worth of a very long novel.","3782":"brings back memories of years gone by,but to much money for a single record or dvd,they could have put a few more songs on it,for the price.","3783":"TY","3784":"Ausgezeichnet!","3785":"As with all Helene other Cd's I have, there was no disappointment in this Cd. I play it as much as all the other I have of Ms Fischer.\nHer voice is powerful, and mild greatly with the music. Being in German make no difference.","3786":"The mixture of \"Unpretty\" and \"I Feel Pretty\" works perfectly.  I love the music of Glee and this is one of the best ones yet.","3787":"Eh...the music is blah and the coach is even more blah.  I prefer Amy Dixon and the Jessica Smith treadmill coach ones I have.","3788":"Great romantic song.","3789":"Heard this song on a 60's radio station and ordered it on my phone from the car!  The Toys were a  \"Girl Group\" from the 60's, who's sound epitomized the Pop Music genre of their day.  Although the Millennials believe todays' music is the end all, be all, Baby Boomers grew up with music whose depth, diversity and quality from the 60's and 70's, remains unparalled.","3790":"I have this song on my cloud player & it is a playlist All by itself. Once i start playin'  it i neva wana stop!","3791":"MF Doom is a true artisan that continues to resusitate this beautiful artform that at times can get stale do to the oversaturation of pop-rap.  I feel energized whenever I hear his production and or vocals, and feel a tinge of nostalga as a result.","3792":"Why have they released this at the wrong speed? I bought Steady Rollin' Man album that slowed this to the proper 78 rpm from the 81 rpm it has been heard at since 1937.  Instead of Alvin the chipmonk on crack you get a full throated Robert Johnson on Steady Rollin' Man. It is a revelation to hear him as he actually sounded. Released a couple of years ago, I see it is for sale used for one cent.  The folks who released this I assume know about the controversy over the speed issue. It is all over the net. There is no question that the slowed version is right, so I ask why this release?","3793":"After first wash they lost there shape and shrink as well. Not to sexy.","3794":"not the BrAd Paisley song :-( . . . Search well and make sure you are buying what you are looking for.  I ourchased in error.","3795":"Great song from a great rapper.","3796":"One of his best songs.  Highly recommended.","3797":"A bunch of remakes and dance club versions of good songs. It's ok. Not amazing. I could go either way on recommending it or not.","3798":"thought this was the brad paisley version and got suckered into buying it, always look closely before purchasing. not a very good rendition of the song","3799":"I'll admit that I'm the dummy who was in a hurry and downloaded this thinking it was Brad Pasley. I wouldn't be so upset if they guy singing at least sounded good. He sounds awful. He shouldn't even be allowed to record music. Please don't make the same mistake I did. They are obviously looking for people like me, who are in a hurry and didn't read it close enough to realize that it isn't really Brad Pasley. Well, they got my money, but it makes me sick. I mean, really, this guys just butchers this song!!!","3800":"There is nothing more to say about the brilliance of RJs music.  However, the clarity of the audio re-mastering is indeed remarkable.","3801":"Did not receive my Galaxy Phone Case, was not in box with other 3 items.","3802":"I think the sound quality is even worse than the other reviewer indicated. Sounds like a high speed CD-R of tracks downloaded from MP3s - if you can find a blog to download these tracks from, you might as well do that instead (this looks like a bootleg compilation, so I doubt the former band members are getting anything from the sales of this CD). AVOID.","3803":"Very orchestra\/elevator sound version.","3804":"Great group. High octane music!","3805":"I am sure this will never get to print but cannot believe it has come to availability of Album only titles selling an entire $40 album for this baby boomer's discretionary income. I'll dig up old cassettes and transfer them to DVD and upload them. Worth the time and money! Thanks you greedy individuals.","3806":"You don't have a fool proof system and because of that I had to buy same item twice. Thank you anyway. I just deleted the second one.","3807":"Beautiful song. I never really listened to the words from the pop version, it irritated me. However, this version\/cover (original version?) is very slow with piano and strings and a soulful male voice. It is beautiful. Especially for an outside setting. We used it to walk down a paver garden path to the lake for our wedding. Very sentimental. Not a dry eye in the place! The song finished with about 30 seconds to spare after we walked and was perfect for the lake back drop to start the beginning of our ceremony.","3808":"I like the original version of this song but after hearing this I'm tempted to change my mind. Jason Walkers take on it is much more personal, deep and thoughtful than six-pence-none-the-richer's fast version (no offense guys!) I love it!","3809":"Awesome","3810":"love it","3811":"Thank you Stevie.  Another great album with a very nice song.. You're the best.  Been following your music for many years","3812":"Musiq SoulChild write songs and music that titilate the senses, brings us to our knees and sends on way to truth","3813":"wrond one","3814":"I downloaded this twice and paid for it twice.  Every time it generated an error when I clicked on \"Play\" money down the drain.","3815":"The song was just not the type of quality gospel music that I was expecting from The Blind Boys or Hank Williams, Jr. so  after purchasing it and listening to it, I deleted it.","3816":"Petra sounds better than ever.","3817":"As a lover of both Petra and loud, heavy guitar; Bob Hartman and company out-do themselves like never before with this AWESOME live offering! I don't particularly care for live albums because the production quality isn't that great, but his live version of Classic Petra hits is way over the top with HUGE, GIGANTIC guitar never before found on the early Petra albums with Greg X Volz. So for me being a major metal fan the big, heavy guitar is an enormous plus! Also, the vocals are amazing! Greg is wailing like old times and the mix is wonderful! This is the Petra I seen in the Ohio Theater in Columbus in 1984 only better...if that's possible! LOL! Also, and more importantly the anointing of God is ALL over this recording! Oil drips from every song as Jesus is lifted high and given glory! This is my new staple album and will be for a long, long time. If you haven't gotten this yet...GET IT! You won't be disappointed! Blessings to you all!\nYBIC,\nJason from Fresno","3818":"Noise, not music.  Soprano sings well, but the rest is awful.  Extremely boring and weak writing make this fit right in with the others on this album.  Do not pay money for this noise that claims to be \"music\".","3819":"Again, more of the same from this \"composer\".  Do not pay money for noise like this that claims to be \"music\".","3820":"More of the same from this \"composer\"--AWFUL.  Do not pay money for noise like this that claims to be \"music\".","3821":"I bought \"That the Night Come\", and it is awful.  The piece itself is crap, although the soprano sings very well, the musicians are mixed down too far, and are not relevant.  Awful piece- don't pay money for noise like this that is sold as \"music\".","3822":"I ordered this CD after having purchased some of their other cd's and was not disappointed.  I saw them in concert a few years ago and they were the best.","3823":"I bought this album at a vintage record shop.  It's a rare and hard to find album and therein ends it's charm unless maybe you are from the era of peace, love and better living through chemistry.  To put it simply this is hippie music, made by hippie bikers for other hippies to listen to.  Maybe that's your thing and maybe you'll love this album.  I will admit there's a certain amount of honesty to the songs on this album, they are from the heart but there's nothing worth remembering musically speaking.  They just don't stand out as something special.","3824":"not what I expected","3825":"nice take on a new arrangement. a nice new spin on an old tune. nice to see that there is still a place out ther for music with a melody, like songs USED to have.","3826":"I love this music, as it makes me feel happy!","3827":"Great CD.","3828":"A \"Warrant\" album without Jani Lane - it just didn't seem right to me, especially after his death. So I resisted this for a long time. I finally decided I'm a fan of more than just Jani Lane. I enjoy the guitar team of Erik Turner and Joey Allen as well. I decided to give this a chance.  I don't love it, but I do really like it.  It has some very solid tracks - \"Home\", \"Life's A Song\", \"Sunshine\" being my favorites. No real clunkers on the album. Solid album.  No, it will never be the same without Jani, but \"The Show Must Go On\" right?","3829":"I bought this for one of my friends as a part of his Christmas gift because I knew he was really into this band. Unfortunately I found out he already had this vinyl. The shipping dates were outrageous for expected delivery. I didn't know it was possible to order from the moon. The package came in this morning after I nearly forgot about it and the corners of the vinyl casing were bent. Now I'm going to try to sell this to Newbury Comics in hopes of buying another vinyl I'm praying he doesn't have.","3830":"Not For Me","3831":"Love it","3832":"This song reminds me of my deceased Father.  How nice it would be to be able to visit him one more time.","3833":"This is essential for any Orbison fan. Sure, you could buy the albums but you'd miss hits like, \"Falling\", \"Mean Woman Blues\", \"Uptown\", etc. I highly recommend purchasing this and the Monument Boxset, which includes the three albums (Roy Orbison Sings Lonely and Blue, Crying, In Dreams) he originally recorded at Monument plus a previously unreleased album, \"Oh Pretty Woman\". This collection also includes individual sleeves for each record plus a full sized piece of paper with Roy's image and a little backstory on him.","3834":"Not only are these covers but they are covers sung badly by people who can't sing.  This is truly a worst buy and hopefully Amazon will remove it from the list of availalable music.","3835":"Great sound from the boys of Warrant. Jani Lane may be gone but his influence on the band is very much alive. Killer track!!","3836":"It's TDF, so what can I say that I haven't said before. This is one of THE 2 seminal power pop punk bands extant, in my view.","3837":"This album is a must have for anyone who enjoys unique, moving lyrics combined with music that is folk and yet modern. The Corners do a great job of conveying powerful truths through song, but on top of that, they will also get you to tap your toes along with them.\nEach song is distinct to the style of the band, but each track shows the diversity of the members' talents. The flow of the album is great, and you don't feel like it's anything you've heard before.\nThe Corners are a gifted new band that you will enjoying listening to until your iPod explodes.","3838":"It said that you're downloading the MP3, but when it finished downloading, it's a MP4, and that won't play on my computer or on my MP3 player. What a waste.","3839":"I heard this song before the album came out and thought it was a B-Side that wasn't gonna get light on an album. So glad it came out on Fear album.","3840":"First, let me preface this by saying that Sojourn is a great ministry full of talented artists.  Isaac Watts has written some of the most inspiring hymns the church has.  Mixing these two things together can only be good.  My review has nothing whatever to do with the lyrical content of the songs - it is solid and awesome, without exception.  I'm only focusing on music here.\n\nLike the other commenters, I really like Sojourn's music. \"Over the Grave\" was my 'gateway' to Sojourn and I was very eager to see what the second volume of Isaac Watts hymns would sound like.  Unfortunately, not being much of a blues fan, I have a really hard time getting into this album.  Aside from my own preferences, I still gave it several careful listens to write a review.  I have to conclude: this album is also not half as musically diverse as \"Over the Grave.\"  It does sound earthy, as other commenters suggested - a little too earthy - and also just plain slow, boring and predictable. With one or two exceptions (\"Compel My Heart to Sing\"), gone are the creative, unexpected progressions of \"Living Faith\" and \"Refuge.\"\n\nSorry, Sojourn - I deeply love a lot of your music, but where did the fire and energy go? Some of the music also hit my ears as wildly incongruous with the lyrics - \"Let the Seventh Angel Sound\" is a song about the triumph and terror of the last day, but the music sounds like a silly Blues Traveler jam session.","3841":"These piano pieces by Dana Suesse are superbly performed by Sara Davis Beuchner in an excellent recording. I have heard other pianists perform some of these pieces, but Ms. Beuchner's renditions are the most successful at preserving the spirit of Dana Suesse. My only complaint about this CD is the conspicuous absence of the haunting 'American Nocturne.' Perhaps Ms. Beuchner will honor us with a performance of this lovely composition on a future CD. Concerning the pieces themselves, it is unfathomable to me that they are not well known. They can be heard repeatedly over time and new things are discovered with each listening. They are indeed exemplar of the times in which Suesse blossomed, nostalgic in a way, but they stand on their own and are elegant, beautiful works of art.","3842":"This is not the original version of the song--quality was very, very bad.","3843":"Her voice was scratchy in the old days.  This recording is even worse.","3844":"When purchasing the song, I intended it to be the original song.  This is a recent recording and not the original recording.","3845":"I was looking for a song for a family video I was making and fell in love with it's beautiful sound. I no plan to listen to it often on my play list.","3846":"This version doesn't start with the slow sad part of the song - it starts out energetically and the slow sad part is still pretty jazzy.  It bugs me that I had to buy it to find that out :\/","3847":"It's bad enough that I have to give this even one star just to leave the review. This sounds like complete trash. As if the mic that the \"singer\" used was his computer mic, and that the band is using toy instruments intended for 5 year olds (who were probably the ones that wrote the lyrics).\nIf they had fun making it, then that's great, but I'd hate to see anyone pay money for this.","3848":"Buyer beware there are other collections that have these songs on them...","3849":"Jane Olivor never attained that superstar level during her brief time in the recording business. To me she is underrated. A unique sound.","3850":"Only down loaded 10 sec. of music?","3851":"Had some songs that were not out of eden on the cd","3852":"perfect for our wedding! Used for bridesmaids' entrance & background music before & after the ceremony. Also just nice music to have on the playlist","3853":"Note that the official orchestra which will play at Will and Kate's wedding will be the London Chamber Orchestra, not the orchestra featured on this recording.\n\nYou should get your first clue on the hurried assembly of this album by looking at No. 56 \"The Marriage of RIGARO.\"  Um, what?  Also, after downloading, I found that quite a few of the pieces didn't have the composer's name attached.  This really wouldn't have taken long to do.  If you like to keep your classical collection cleaned up by composer, you'll have to fill them in yourself.\n\nI highly doubt Kate would choose \"Amazing Grace,\" [track 4] complete with banjo backup for either her ceremony or reception. Just my opinion.  \"Dies Irae\" by Benjamin Britten [track 7] means \"Day of Wrath.\"  Also can't imagine ever hearing this one at a wedding.  Overall, there are some random warhorses of the popular classical repertoire here, which would not make good wedding or reception music.\n\nOn to the good points.  The recording features some notable orchestras and \"The Royal Wedding Orchestra\" does a fine job, particularly on \"The Earle of Oxford's March\" and Mendelssohn's iconic \"Wedding March.\"  There are some satisfying long tracks like the 1812 Overture (with cannons and church bells!) and the Emperor Waltz.  The full spectrum of musical eras is represented, from William Byrd (Renaissance) up through Vaughan Williams and Britten for the 20th Century.  It's a nice collection if you don't have these standards already, or are seeking alternate versions to possibly improve your collection.\n\nEdited to add:  Tracks 36 and 51 are virtually identical.  Both are solo piano versions of \"Liebestraum\" by Franz Liszt.  More evidence of the sloppy nature of the compilation.\n\nIf you're seeking artists that Kate and William will be hearing, I'd suggest you look at the recordings of Claire Jones, who is the official harpist to the Prince of Wales and will be playing at the reception.  The London Chamber Orchestra also has extensive listings on Amazon.\n\nOverall, I recommend this album at the $1.99 price.","3854":"Unintelligible in parts.","3855":"Can't get it to play from my phone...so to me it's waste of miney","3856":"Olivia is one of the best. If you saw the anime series Nana, then you know about Olivia. This is a deluxe edition of her music that contains 2 cds and 1 dvd. The DVD is only viewable on a universal or PAL dvd player. CD1contains songs from the Nana anime: Wish, Starless Night, Close your eyes, Winter sleep, tears & rainbows, and let go. CD2 contains songs from 'The Cloudy Dreamer\": If you only knew, Stars shining out, Dream Catcher, Who's gonna stop it?, Cloudy world, Cut me free, and a bonus track: Wish (English version).\n\nThe DVD contains songs from Nana, the Cloudy dreamer, and The Lost Lolli:  Stars shining out, Wish (live video), Wish (Anime clip), Alone in our Castle, let go, SpiderSpins, Devil's in me\nIf you have never heard Olivia sing, go onto YTube to view some of these songs\/clips. She is versatile, sensitive and truly a musical artist.","3857":"Weight loss is only going to happen with self control and a consistent routine of moderate exercise.  So don't expect to listen to this a time or two and wake up like Jennifer Anniston, Carmen Diaz, or whomever.  However, it is extremely relaxing and likely helps most people to get off to a decent nights sleep which is also integral for weight reduction.","3858":"If you buy this CD, you will need a lifeguard to save you from drowning in the wash of bitter regret that will flood over you when you realize that you would come out the same after throwing your hard earned money into the sea rather than buy this dribble. \"Twilight Blue,\"Vacation Beach\"? Someone is trying way too hard. Listen to the .MP3 samples before you even think about \"one-clicking\" a purchase. If you still want to buy the CD, do me a favor and pre-pay for your funeral and burial plot - you're already dead.","3859":"Beautiful And relaxing.","3860":"Music no voice.  I wish I would had know that before purchasing.","3861":"How enjoyable is to press \"play\" and to listen to the rich sounds and resonance of Yo Yo Ma and his cello mixed with Hayden's brilliance. While I find this music perfect for studying to, it is also one of delight to sit back and enjoy.","3862":"Michael Poulsen makes this song.\n\nThe other songs on the album I did not care for.","3863":"I love this song. It represents my feeling.  The military should not be in the nation building business.  The military is for defending our country.  Except for protection our embassies or involvement in an active war, they should be brought home.  These young people are not pawns for politicians to show how brave they are.","3864":"One of the best songs ever","3865":"Awesome!","3866":"great album","3867":"Richard Marx may not have the most iconic voice in pop music, but boy has it aged beautifully.  This version of Now and Forever is even better than the original, with warm tones replacing the 80's produced sound. The recording is crystal clear and reminds me what a great singer can do with a great song!","3868":"Such a beautiful song that comes from the heart. Another one that's a favorite of mine is\" The best of me\", sung by Barry Manilow","3869":"I am def. NOT into this CD. The voice is the same but without their music remixed, it lacks a LOT. NOT happy about paying so much. Only 1 or 2 GOOD songs","3870":"CRAP! CRAP! CRAP! I love iiO, and have ALL their singles & Poetica album! This 2nd album feels like a collection of the left-over \"average\" songs from Poetica! Some of these songs should have been left on the cutting room floor.\nThere's a reason why these didn't make the final cut on Poetica! Most of them are pretty crappy! Even for iio fans, this is a stretch!","3871":"When I first heard the announcement I was uber excited.  Iio has been my favorite since they started!  However, I am also a big fan of Nadia's solo act and instantly wondered why she wasn't promoting this work.  It was very odd considering she promotes her work quite aggressively.\n\nHowever, I patiently waited for Amazon to release the downloadable mp3s and finally purchased it.  I've listened to the entire album about 3 times now.  Like the title says, the only good thing about this entire album are the seductive and mesmerizing vocals of Nadia Ali.  The production is quite one-dimensional, boring, and plain.  In some tracks it's flat out bad.\n\nMarcus Moser needs to dig deep within himself and produce something original and something that has soul.  I think it's time for him to stop making money off of Nadia Ali's older recorded songs that didn't make it into the Poetica album.\n\nThe Iio duo - Nadia Ali was clearly the stronger artist.  Now that she's gone, Iio lacks soul and vision.","3872":"I cannot find the original Sonique song. i found it in the Apple store but these variations are good but not what I am seeking","3873":"I like how they extended the theme, but it just doesn't sound like the theme I know and love sorry","3874":"not miquel brown","3875":"Reviewing Stravinsky after some years of personal neglect via my Kindle. Fine performances.","3876":"I haven't listened to the download, but the CD issue (which Amazon.com doesn't list, for some reason, but it exists) is pitched noticeably sharp.  Naxos has just issued this same recording, in much better sound, and pitched correctly.","3877":"Really awful remix of BTW.  No vocals excdept 'Born This Way' and has music that is just so bad it's undanceable.","3878":"Don't get me wrong, this is an awesome album, but why would anyone pay $5 for an album you can download in a much higher quality format FOR FREE, LEGALLY, FROM THE BAND'S WEBSITE.","3879":"Fantastic work by Uma Mohan. Such remarkable fusion of divine chants with modern music.","3880":"The tunes are catchy and very listenable.  I don't care for the Christian hip-hop theme but it is very interesting that a record like this exists.  Warriors is a rabble-rousing tune.  Worth a listen.","3881":"My fault- thought this song was made famous from different artist. :(","3882":"There are 6 tracks on this CD. Not all are great but worth listening to. The only thing missing on the back cover listing is the bonus 6th track which is a cover of \"You Spin Me Round\".","3883":"Beautiful song.","3884":"I have two children and find this song to be one of the more annoying children songs that I have ever heard. I know that my kids would rate it much higher.","3885":"Good song though not complete. After recording I found out that this song was not complete loading of the original song.","3886":"This is NOT a song for a children's album. Seriously! At one point in the song it is saying that Clementine is under the water, basically drowning and all her lover can see is her red lips \"dreadful sorry Clementine\", but it's okay because he has her sister to fall back on! Horrible song for an album called Happy Songs for Kids.\nMy advice is Don't download this for your kids.","3887":"The best Japanses Power Metal Band Bar None! Loudness who?","3888":"Nice song, I needed it for my home video of  Alberta Canada so it fit well, this song sounds nice because it has a symphony behind it, and John has good reverb i'd give it 2 stars. It Just makes it into the majestic category.","3889":"Denver wrote \"cornball\" lyrics the penetrated millions of hard hearts. This and all the others","3890":"John Denver was such a fantastic song writer and singer....a talent we lost too early.  This song is one of his best,if not the best .  He really knew what love is and how to make love be felt when listening to his songs.","3891":"When I lost my great grandmother, it was like I lost my mother.  My mom was a struggling single parent, and my great grandmother was my main time caretaker when she was gone working long hours.  My grandmother's death was like losing my other parent and hurt so much that I could hardly breathe.  This song helped me open up my grief and pour out all the pain I had tried so desperately to hold.  By doing that, I could finally set myself free from my made prison inside my soul.  If you feel disconnected from God because you are struggling, this song sings deep into your soul and gives you the ability to get down on your needs and ask for God to help you.  Even if you are not going through any trouble, this song satisfies from mainstream music that may lead you toward a more desperate and hurtful direction should something arise.  I would recommend this to anyone who is not into pop-like music.","3892":"Not the version I thought.","3893":"i've been listening to this for over a week straight ...  (maybe \"daily\" would be a better way of putting it.. lol) .... and i don't see me stopping anytime soon. it has some very unique and clever tunes in it, and lyrically it isn't piled full of rubbish. Buy This... 5 stars no question.","3894":"Album contains 51 peaceful songs for infants. Very conducive to lulling a baby to sleep. Can also be used to provide soft background music for child's playtime.","3895":"This album was... ok. Unfortunately it all has about the same feel and pattern so there's very little diversity to the music, which can seem a bit monotonous.","3896":"The song skips and stops everytime I play. It stops then comes back on and it was for the baby. I love the song but I cant listen to it all the way with out it stopping.","3897":"I have to re-download this song on my kindle since my wifi was lost during the sync.  But other than that this was one of my first purchases and I love it!","3898":"My daughter ordered this l","3899":"In my attempts to replace a single 45 RPM of this song I once had in the 60's, I listened to samples of quite a few versions.  My research lead me through groups like The Ventures, but this version is the one I remember.  What was great about this version, was I could imagine a horse and rider galloping on a prairie.  One hears what could be sounds of hoofs hitting the ground at galloping speed, possibly a bird whistling, and this pretty tune.  I'm sure all the sounds were from guitars and the effects they could produce at that period of time.  Out of all the single versions of the instrumental \"Apache\", this is my favorite.","3900":"I previewed every song in this collection and it is very obvious that every sound is being played by a robot on a synthesizer. The steel drum sounds are not even good ones. They sound like any Casio keyboard. They should not be allowed to sell this rip off under the name 'steel drums'. It's false advertising and you will be able to tell right away too. Don't waste your money on this. There are many excellent steel drum albums available on Amazon. Unfortunately, there are also many fakers like this. Just preview them first and you'll be able to tell the difference.","3901":"I really love rockin to this with my nephew.  I think this is great because as he grows older he'll recognize more and more of the music that his family already listens to.  Thanks!","3902":"Let me just start by saying that i was really eager to buy this album because i have really loved Omnia's previous offerings for the most part. This one was a real let down! Steve has gone off on some misguided idea that he can rap (as Dr. Sic... blech) . The instrumental songs on this album are really really nice, and i recommend downloading those if you are an Omnia fan, but basically all of the tracks with vocals are not good. Just plain not good. The first time i  listened to this album i didn't like it but i thought, \"hey, i'll give it another chance, afterall, it's Omnia!\" And i listened to it again two more times, and liked it less and less each time. I liked this album so little that i actually decided that it was so bad that i no longer liked Omnia at all, in light of this present incarnation! And i liked Omnia a LOT! But after a year or so after listening to this album, i have come back to Omnia and i still enjoy their other albums very much, and like i said, the instrumental tracks off of this one. I feel like maybe they are just trying to reinvent themselves in a fashion, or trying to incorporate other influences, and it hasn't gelled yet. Hopefully in the next album it will gel! i hope so!","3903":"Daniel Michaels is almost forgotten, but his terrific arrangements of the standards from the great American songbook are unparalleled. These tracks are selected, I believe, from the many Reader's Digest LP's that were the backbone of every, great beautiful music station in the country in the sixties.\n\nBuy these, put them on, reach for a Negroni with your someone special, and take a trip to paradise!","3904":"High quality! Amazing collection of talent!!!","3905":"Omnia went someplace that didn't appeal to me as a group but this song captures all the old magic, literally. It's a soulful instrumental, not one of their wild (and wonderful) pagan excusions, but achingly beautiful and I never get tired of it. The other songs on this album that I liked were Saltatio Vita (very similar to their old style) and Shamaniac, though that one won't appeal to everyone. But this song? It captures all the primitive magic of the moon!","3906":"Some sort of terrible Miku filter over a real work of art. Don't know how you're allowed to sell this on Amazon.","3907":"The music on the CD was on an old Tribute Album to Eric Clapton that I have had for quite some tie..  I screwed up the CD so I had some skips on it.  Finally found the same music under a different name. Check it out....","3908":"Product exactly as advertised, and it was received promptly.","3909":"For me, the weak point of most modern blues albums is the songwriting. With the huge catalog of great songs to choose from here, I figured I would strike gold with this album. Not so. Most of the tunes are bland and lifeless. If it wasn't for Taj Mahal's solo acoustic cover of Honky Tonk Women, this disc would have done a Frisbee impersonation flying out my csr window. Come on, you blues artists and producers: you are recording 20th & 21st century blues, not a lame television commercial or elevator music. Where are the dynamics, the passion? The bunch of you should have listened to records like Exile On Main Street, Derek & the Dominoes, Cheap Thrills by Big Brother before taking a step inside the studio or picking up your guitar. Should have read about those recording sessions or live performances to get inspiration. How can a bus load of amazing modern blues musicians have as their resource a catalog of songs like the Rolling Stones body of work and not come out kicking, jumping, rocking, swaying, grinding and squealing?","3910":"great song, great lyrics.... good poetry!","3911":"Great CD;  arrived promptly.  Thanks!","3912":"Great song.  Well done by this group.  I am a big fan of tahitian music, other fans would enjoy it as well.","3913":"nice piece of sheet music, in good shape","3914":"I have seen these guys back since their beginnings when they were a young band in Madison, Wisconsin called 'Stinkfish'.  They went on to become the 'Siren Six!' & then 'Big City Rock'.  Although, in my humble opinion nothing will ever top the energy & fun they emitted on stage & musically as they did with Stinkfish & Siren Six!, I was really happy to have seen them finally get some attention & mild success as Big City Rock when they left the midwest & headed into the sunny hills of CA.  I enjoyed the first couple of EP's BCR put out, but the s\/t album was a stretch for me.  They clearly wanted to write a pop album & stand aside bands like the Killers, Franz Ferdinand, etc. of the time.  I never saw them as that kind of group.  It felt to me these guys (from BCR & before) always had an edge to their sound even when they were reaching for the mainstream audience.  They could still write awesome hooks & deliver the pop without the pretension & maintain having an identity.  With the Remainers, I listened to the clips of all 6 tracks of the EP & have to say their is nothing on here that keeps my attention whatsoever.  A huge disappointment for me.  It definitely picks up where BCR left off in the consistency & style of the songwriting but on a downward slope.  So, if you really liked that BCR s\/t album then by all means, but I was hoping they would have returned to an earlier style of material they did (like the original cut of 'Human').  The Remainers songs are well crafted, recorded, & produced.  Nate's vocals sound crisp & plush, Frank's keys are good as always & the drumming hammers out like it did in BCR.  That being said, this beat goes on to orchestrate an utterly forgettable list of assembly line pop songs with not much to be desired.  Even the song titles are flat & uninspired where they have to be overtly pronounced in every chorus, as if trying to be a #1 single at every opportune moment.  They have lost their artistic balance of the pop\/indie sensibility they once had & just wanted to continue to set sale into that forgettable sea of mundane dance\/pop & WB network serenades geared up to appropriately target kids in their teens & early 20's.  I'm really not trying to be harsh.  I'm just not sure how else to describe it accurately for what it is & what they seem to be going for.  I think they are better than this material here & need to find their center again.  I'll have to check in at a later time & see what they go on to try next, but I don't think I can take much more of this.  For those that really, really, really, really like modern pop then give this a shot, but if you were even slightly on the fence with that last BCR album as I was then don't waste your time.","3915":"I love this CD. Its an album you can play every track on. Nice clean christian music with moving lyrics. Totally recommend.","3916":"I got a Sony Walkman for my birthday so I downloaded this song as one of my favorites, along with some other ones.  I plan to buy some more songs to download.  Love this site!","3917":"We had this album in the house when I was growing up (I'm 58 now) It's arrangements are fun and it brings back great memories. The sound quality is good too.","3918":"ethereal","3919":"Love this song!!","3920":"LOL what name. My friend's nick name so I bought this for her","3921":"This album shipped from Oklahoma, went to Dallas, then Chicago, and is now headed to Pittsburgh. I live in Memphis. What the hell is going on??","3922":"can't download the 2 album set onto my iphone 4.","3923":"Good band","3924":"The music video is just hilarious, and I haven't laughed so hard for a long time. The senario, the creative outlet. Like the shyness, the \" what's going on\" look?! Like she's lost, confused. In the music video it's like a \"CURSE\". It's like she see's this fortune teller, the fortune teller told her to take a \"SMALL\" bite out of the heart- shaped cookie. The cookie was so \"SWEET\", she made a mistake and took a \"BIGGER\" gulp. She say's \"true\" love would find you. LOL! Apparently, lol. It didn't turn out exactly the way she wanted it to be!!\n\nI guess.. it magnetically drawn guys to her, became magically obsessed with her. lol. Everywhere she goes.. guy's keep stalking her, fighting over her. Fighting to where it's very dangerous, she needs to \" stay away\".\n\nBut the daring, Bold Lopez.. is a little mischevious, looking into trouble. Or trying to be \"curious\" of what's going on around her. People getting into car accidents, are WILD!! But, sometimes.. Curiousity \"kills\" the Cat. But.. the funny part is!! She acts like nothing \"happen\", is just dancing with a bunch of guys and Joking around.\n\nI don't really consider that \"flirting\". It's more comical, and a cute Senario, joking around. Then her Papi comes, saves her. All the other guys are sulking, like \" screw this\". She forgets her purse, none of the guys take it. They don't want money!!\n\nShe runs off in her MINI Lopez car, is with her Papi. He's in the military. He looks like ED Tempelton. in the video. I was laughing. It was her twin.\n\nBut music videos aren't real. It's just for fun. Don't believe everything u hear! One time.. I was watching a music video, this guy had a bunch of hoochies all over him, it turned out he wasn't like that. He was actually not \"kissing\" them. They were all over him but yeah he wasn't a player. He was actually shy, modest. I remember.. jay- Z was flashing his Euro money in the camera. People were like \"yeah\" he's all cocky, greedy an flashing his money around.\n\nIt turned out Jay-z isn't cocky, greedy. I heard he's actually real, has a heart.\n\nI suppose they say never judge people by it's cover, unless u really know them. Like the rumors of Jenny, her being a ho. They're not true! It's just gossip.\n\nDon't believe in her music videos as well. Just because she's flirting in the video or whatever it maybe. It's the senario that's trying to match with the song.\n\nLike \" I'm into you\". It's about a women who's into a guy. Not Jenny into that guy! People are so naive, dumb. They think because she's all over a guy in the video she's a ho. It's not true!\n\nOnly a person with a brain would understand that!","3925":"this is a hot song, i really enjoy running to it, thanks I love it, I will order more songs","3926":"When it has came down to Jennifer Lopez, she honestly has a lot to really think of for the next few years, aside from the cancellation  of American Idol, and her own personal life in the ruins, with the end of her relationship with her boyfriend Casper, she honestly has a whole lot  to look forward to in her future. Unfortunately, she still has had a whole to deal with, especially with her music taking a tailspin downward. She still needs to find her own voice again. Her latest set of songs for the past several years have honestly not been the best in her voice. Her last album A.K.A. was so poor, it was not even close to even worth buying. That has also been the same with her last album Love?, which took several years, and a few poor starts.  I'm Into You, isn't exactly one of her better songs on the album. The song feels like I've heard it from Jennifer before, and it feels very weak from the heart alone. Her and Lil' Wayne have absolutely poor chemistry along the song. I really didn't find Jennifer gave it her best, honestly her weakest on this album. Hopefully, she needs to make better when her next album comes up.\n\nSong: D+","3927":"I'm not much of a J Lo fan but I do like this song,it's great while exercising or just chillen","3928":"I love this song from JLO \"Love\" deluxe CD and is an amazing dance song written by Lady GaGA,this is gonna be a club smash and I hope it is released. If you have not bought \"Love\" yet, you should it is a great CD and has this amazing club song \"Hypnotico\".","3929":"I bought this song because am a big fan of hatsune miku. Also this is different music witch I love.","3930":"Heard this on Sense8 and liked it enough to add it my collection!","3931":"First of all I have to admit that I've always been a Robben Ford fan. Having said that, in my opinion, it is indisputable that this is a fantastic CD.\nIf you are a blues fan and you like \"blue guitar\" played the way it should be: intense, passionate and with great feeling; if you think that slow blues are the real deal, do not hesitate and buy this CD! It is going to be your bliss for the foreseeable future.","3932":"I bought this recording to hear Strauss' Japanese Festival Music, Op. 84 (1940). The full title is Festmusik zur Feier des 2600jhrigen Bestehens des Kaiserreichs Japan fr groes Orchester (Japanische Festmusik), since it was the only available option.\n\nThe Japanese government commissioned music from composers of six nations to mark the 2,600th anniversary of the Japanese Empire. Other composers writing for the festivities included:\n\nHisato Ohzawa who wrote his Symphony no. 3, \"Symphony of the Founding of Japan\"\nJacques Ibert who wrote an Ouverture de fte \"pour clbrer le 26e centenaire de la fondation de l'empire Nippon\"\nIldebrando Pizzetti who wrote a Symphony \"In Celebrazione dell XXVIo Centenario della Fondazione dell'Impero Giapponese\"\nSndor Veress who wrote his first symphony, \"Hungarian Greetings on the 2600th Anniversary of the Japanese Dynasty\"\nBenjamin Brittens Sinfonia da Requiem was also commissioned in this process, but was ultimately rejected by the Japanese foreign ministry as an insult (good for Britten!)\n\nJapans request for a composition from an American composer was turned down due to the deterioration of relations between the countries.\n\nJoseph Goebbels assigned the Japanese commission to Germany's most prominent composer, Richard Strauss. Strauss, age 75, put aside composition on his opera Die Liebe der Danae to work on Japanese Festival Music while staying in the Italian Tyrol. He completed the work on April 22, 1940 and received 10,000 Reichsmarks for his effort. If nothing else, the Nazis made life more enjoyable with easy money.\n\nThere are five sections:\nMeerszene (Seascape)\nKirschbltenfest (Cherry Blossom Festival)\nVulkanausbruch (Volcanic Eruption)\nAngriff der Samurai (Attack of the Samurai)\nLoblied auf den Kaiser (Hymn of the Emperor)\n\nJapanese Festival Music is written for a large orchestra 3 Flutes (piccolo), 2 oboes, English Horn, 4 clarinets, bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, contrabassoon, 8 French horns, 4 trumpets, 4 trombones, 2 Tubas, 14 tuned temple gongs, timpani, various percussion, two harps and strings. There is also an option for either an organ or an additional 3 trumpets, 4 trombones and 2 French horns. One of Strauss' works for chamber orchestra, in other words...\n\nThe premire was at the Kabukiza Theatre, Tokyo on December 14, 1940. Helmut Fellmer, a music professor in Tokyo at the time, conducted the NHK Symphony Orchestra augmented to 165 musicians for this occasion. The audience for this occasion also heard the other three commemorative works. Fellmer conducted this orchestra again on December 19, 1940 for a recording on Nippon Columbia.\n\nJapanese Festival Music is probably Richard Strausss least programmed work and is often described as one of his weakest compositions. Norman Del Mar compared it to the Festliches Prludium (Festive Prelude for Orchestra and Organ) in which a vast orchestra piles one towering climax upon another. Strauss conducted the work for recording in late 1940 with the Bavarian State Opera Orchestra (possibly he recorded it before the Tokyo premiere); this recording was issued on CD in 1990 by Deutsche Grammophon in a 3-CD set of Strauss conducting his own works (catalogue number 429 925-2 GDO3), and four years later on Preiser 90205.\n\nI didn't do my due diligence and run the Japanese webpage through Google Translate (though it has significant problems translating Japanese into intelligible English). It would seem that these CDs are a knock-off of the Columbia Nippon 1940 recording. I was amazed at how bad the sound was, regardless of when it was recorded. In 1940, the Germans were pioneers of hi-fi sound, though they may have kept this capability secret, given that Hitler used this recording technology to prerecord his speeches, so they could be transmitted from 3-4 different halls at the same time as he was giving his speech live somewhere. Being a murderous dictator, I presume that he wouldn't have liked to give out advance notice to the RAF about where he was going to appear \"live\" so they could drop a few bombs on him so he could appear dead (something close to that would happen to one of Goebbels' Reich-wide propaganda radio transmissions, which embarrassingly went off the air a few minutes after it started due to a British bombing raid on Berlin, probably prompting many angry Germans to shout \"MEYER!\" in frustration). I guess that's why they didn't share this Vergeltungswaffe with the Tojo regime.\n\nAt the very least, considering that this is one of only 2 recordings of the Japanese Festival Music - don't trust those \"Strauss' Complete Symphonic Works\" CD compilations out there people - I would have expected the Japanese to remaster the sound to a standard that it is possible to listen to. As it is, I wouldn't bother listening to this recording, though from what little I could hear, the music wasn't as bad as del Mar made it out to be. Even uninspired Strauss writing music for dictators didn't sink low enough as to produce complete musical drivel bad enough to get called \"Meyer\" by detractors. The NHK's playing is otherwise tolerable, though there are some major intonation bloopers audible through the snap, crackle and pop.","3933":"Hard, raw blues. Good music.","3934":"India is one of the most underrated singer in the music industry.  Her vocals on this song takes you on a journey and to a different level. She is truly AMAZING! I was happy to finally find this song on amazon.com.  I had been looking to purchase this song for many years and am extremely happy with it.  It took me back, way back to the freestyle music days with RPBC and Producer Eddie Rivera RIP.","3935":"Awesome!","3936":"Excelent","3937":"His music puts me in a zone of total relaxation regardless of what I am doing at the time.  He is my favorite.","3938":"It make you jump up and dance and snap your fingers..","3939":"Love his work.  Born to Groove is still my favorite!","3940":"I don't no I just so sad I pay 24.00 dollers for 4 songs","3941":"this song doesn't sound like the one in the preview","3942":"The song they are selling does not sound like the one on the preview, words are the same but the music isn't. What a ripoff, I want my money back!!","3943":"I only bought this for my music classes.  Personally I don't care for mariachi music.  But  I guess the compilation of tunes is appropriate.","3944":"didn't work","3945":"Bob Draga gets a beautiful, round tone from his clarinet that I don't hear from anyone else.","3946":"They are so incredibly talented and dedicated!","3947":"Jeff Bezos supports attacks on our representatives as happened today. I will not spend any money with vendors on Jeff Bezos site","3948":"5*","3949":"Just as expected.","3950":"CD arrived scratched.  Very unhappy!","3951":"Hard to believe the voices singing this beautiful song are so young and are Italian. Their English and pronunciation are perfect. Having ally friends listen to it. Just fantastic.","3952":"I have to say that for a very adamant fan that I was very let down by this release. I've tried giving it a couple of chances and hoping that the next listen will yield a better experience but it never does. This album fails to do what their past albums have done which is to inspire awe. When I listen to old tracks such as, \"Threads\" or \"Quiet\" or basically any of their other tracks I feel  a sense of utter power. Tunnel Blanket is aptly named because while listening to you will want to curl up with a blanket and go to sleep. Gone are the tracks with ethereal guitar and pounding drums this is just now a lullaby and a bad one at that. There is a lot of synth on this LP but the whole thing to me at least just lacks substance it's very ambient but by being that way not one track on this album sticks out. I would love to listen to this to go to sleep because it is beautiful to a degree but just way under the talent that This Will Destroy you possesses. The whole thing feels a little effortless and a giant step back in their amazing music catalogue. Let's just hope on the next project they step it up a bit. I'm still a fan but I guess I expect more from this band.","3953":"I love it, and listen at work on my phone.....","3954":"The sound is not very clear","3955":"Very pleased.","3956":"The recording earns its lone star because it is a beautiful performance.\nThe big problem is that it is sung by Friedrich Dallberg in the role of Veit Pogner. Herbert Gosebruch's role in this performance was Ortel der Seifensieder. Since I was looking for a recording by Gosebruch it was most disappointing.","3957":"Love this song. Love the selection of Hip Hop Artist. GAME opens strong, Lil Wayne is a throw away verse, but then Swizz Beatz comes and does his thing and even though I don't like Rick Ross.....his verse is dope. All awesome over heavy drums! Good workout song!","3958":"While I love alot of what Vedder's done on his own including the entire soundtrack to \"Into The Wild\" (which is AWESOME), I think he went too far with this song. Sounds more like a \"Don Ho\" impersonation and the song is really G_Y !!! Sorry. It's just TERRIBLE !!!","3959":"I recieved the cd promptly as expected. I like slow blues a lot. It was not the kind of music I expected.  No information where the cd was made or who the artist. The cd played only once. The second time I wanted to listen it just spin and spin hard as if it is strugling to play. I unfortunately just discard it away.","3960":"Shipping took forever.","3961":"I know many people hate the Rebecca Black song (I don't - it is stupid catchy tune from a cute kid).  but this \"Dylan\" version is actually a really good song!  You have to ignore how stupid the lyrics are, of course.  It's a great parody of both the great Bobby Z and the viral R Black.  I think it is worth the 99 cents!  (as a 50-something rock and roller who has seen everyone from Dylan to Tull to Zeppelin, I should be embarrassed to write this review, I know...).  So sue me.","3962":"Bruno Bruno Bruno.... he sings from the heart and knows exactly what to say. He can sing to me anyday!","3963":"Very dissappointed.. My fault, I thought it had singing on it as well.. NOT !! lol I'll be more carefull next time I order.","3964":"Brings back memories...","3965":"They are not call the University of Salsa for nothing. If you are a fun this is one of if not all of their recording that you as a collector should have. Buy it.","3966":"Good song.","3967":"I was expecting something else, no wonder it took me so long to finally give it a listen. It is a mix of \"Timbalero\" that I do not find that fantastic except for the parts that have flashes of the original melody. Honestly, this is not one of my favorites, and I say if you are going to remix something, then make it comparable (e.g. Natural Woman Carole King\/Aretha Franklin, Say a Little Prayer - Dionne\/Aretha, Annie's Song Anne M\/?, Frio Frio Juan Luis Guerra\/N'Klabe) or even better.....but this version is just plain annoying. The only way I could recommend this would be if you were a collector of all and everything EGC, otherwise why mess up a classic.","3968":"I have been listening to the music of John Michael Talbot for almost 35 years. From his early days singing with his brother Terry to his move into the Catholic Church, from his folk- rock days to his contemplative liturgical style, the center message of his music has always been to glorify God the Father, worship Jesus Christ the Son in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Whether you are an Evangelical, Charismatic, Anglican, Pentecostal, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran or Catholic, the message and spirit of John's music lifts you into the presence of the Lord. His latest offering is the reflection of his journey further down the road towards the Kingdom of Heaven.","3969":"This is my first experience downloading a song\/album from Amazon and it will be my last.  I've been unable to find this single song anywhere else so I was excited when I found it here.  I'm pretty tech savvy but I couldn't get this to transfer to iTunes.\n\nAfter two plus hours of following the directions to add it explicitly it never did anything.  I finally had to side-load the song to my mobile then pull it off my phone to iTunes.\n\nIt was a ridiculous jump through hoops for one song.","3970":"Great CD, can't stop listening to it!  Arrived quickly, still in shrink wrap, brand new as promised.","3971":"an amazing voice, a great song writer and a personality that won't quit.","3972":"Unfortunately, I did not like the version of the song.","3973":"Solid songs but they get old after a while.  I loved this album for about a week and then grew tired of it.","3974":"Beautiful song","3975":"Surprisingly upbeat pretty accordion inflected eclectic collection of western swing and latin selections. The version of \"Love Minus Zero--No limit\" is outstanding.","3976":"Great.","3977":"Been a huge fan of this band since 2002 - had the privilege of playing with them when they were in their prime, but this album is pretty dissapointing, when Che left they should have disbanded - the new vocalist's vox are really dissapointing and just don't have much kick or conviction to them..\n\nthe album sounds lazy and rushed, the 2-3 awesome tracks are all bunched together near the end but a lot of the album sounds like  lazy politics over music which comes nowehere near the excellence of 'sands of time'.\n\nProceed with caution.","3978":"When I sampled this tune on the internet I thought it was something I would like. I usually enjoy inspirational music, but this version gets old fast and I could get by fine without it. There are so many better versions out there.","3979":"mom loved it.","3980":"never bought this","3981":"These chants are really divine and so beautifully sung.\nThe music is very good too.\nIf you really want to commune with the divine, use this music and sit in meditation and enjoy the beautiful environment created by the rhythms and chants.\nAll the best,\nRahul","3982":"beautiful hymn","3983":"Am old time, all time favorite.","3984":"Good songs to listen to and that praise Gods name","3985":"Like","3986":"When I sampled this tune on the internet I thought it was something I would like. I usually enjoy inspirational music, but this version gets old fast and I could get by fine without it. There are so many better versions out there.","3987":"This is one of my favorite hymns, it is comforting lyrically & could not be more unearthly beautiful melodically. The \"beautiful, beautiful river\" is from the tears of people touched by this piece.","3988":"Great song about how some people use religion to serve their own agenda. So well sung - I'm afraid of what you'll do in the name of your God.","3989":"Great Album","3990":"Totally awesome","3991":"When I sampled this tune on the internet I thought it was something I would like. I usually enjoy inspirational music, but this version gets old fast and I could get by fine without it. There are so many better versions out there.","3992":"This is a beautiful traditional hymn, capable of making one's soul sing along.  I stand grateful to artists donating time and talents as living expressions of God's love!","3993":"ok","3994":"This song as a real good beat that you can dance too.the words are good too. I think it will sell a lot of CD,s","3995":"Great Album","3996":"Thank you","3997":"This is ok but not really good. There is better music in this genre to buy and listen too. I wasted my time.","3998":"I appreciate songs like this - and this is well done! I heartily recommend it to anyone who chooses to buy it.","3999":"did not order this","4000":"This album was clearly designed to induce pain.  There is nothing positive about this album except the ending which comes far too late.\n\nGuys, wrap it up. Give up. Move on. The world will thank you for it. You're giving circus music a bad name.\n\nJust kidding.  Shameless is brilliant. It defines me as a person. A psycho. Who is obsessed with a girl I didn't even officially date for 2ish months. I've got problems and Man Man in my collection is just one of them.\n\nI just relistened to this album at the insistence of friends who are big Man Man fans and found myself hating it even more.  Life Sucks and so does Man Man (that really should be the name of this lp).","4001":"My dad played this for my brother and I when we were young. It had us in hysterics. It was only a record release. I am glad to see that it's been made available again.","4002":"Of all the songs and all the arrangements performed by the City Slickers, this is easily the most beautiful (straight) and technically difficult when things start popping.  A good introduction for people who have never heard of Spike Jones.","4003":"a+++++","4004":"30 seconds long, somewhat pointless, and sung to the tune of \"London Bridge is Falling Down\". Two stars is being kind. The preview is 25 seconds long. You can get a pretty good idea of what the entire piece is like from that.","4005":"Didn't even know this song existed until a while back.  It is ust a great tribute to our great state.","4006":"Love","4007":"A total waste of space, My two-year-old could do better would not recommend to anyone. Don't waste your time or space!,,,,","4008":"I was inspired to listen to this gem based on the unique and complex illustrative cover art.  The second I pressed play I knew I was being taken on a musical journey.  The sad, off-tune guitar twang really set the mood and relaxed me.  I imagine this song would be great if there were lyrics and a lead singer.  Sadly, a man with a terrible cold bypassed the recording studio's security and was somehow able to begin yelling out nonsense into the microphone while this incredible band was performing and trying to create art.\n\nPerhaps next time the studio will have more security in place to prevent masterpieces like this from being destroyed again.","4009":"I agree with most of the other reviewers; this song is pretty awful, although I think that's on purpose.  The fact that it's intentionally lousy doesn't make it any more listenable, though.\n\nAs far as these free \"song of the day\" offerings, another site I frequent is KCRW's \"Today's Top Tune.\"  Their song today is good.  It's from Release the Sunbird, a side project of Zach Rogue of Rogue Wave.","4010":"You get used to a certain level of indie DIY ethos on many of the free downloads and that is to be commended, in my view. However, this track is of such nominal quality, both musically and artistically, that I can call it reprehensible. It's not art, it's caterwauling. You want to hear atonal art - listen to EN, Sonic Youth, Throbbing Gristle, et. al. This is just amateurs pretending to have an independent ethos and failing miserably at it. Weak sauce. Fail. Rag and bone.","4011":"Really Bad! Off key and stupid lyrics. I really can't think of any type of music group this would appeal to. Maybe it's a joke on us.","4012":"If you don't understand what on earth the singer's trying to say in Joan of Arc's \"Love Life,\" it could be because he brays the words in such a tuneless explosion of noise that it's sometimes hard to make out the individual syllables.  Then again, it could simply be that the lyrics don't make any sense.  I'm not one who balks at deep or complex song lyrics; at the age of six or seven I used to listen to Simon and Garfunkel and pick apart the meanings of songs such as \"El Condor Pasa.\"  If the lyrics to \"Love Life\" go over my head, I believe it has much less to do with any lack of sensitivity and insight on my part than the fact that this sounds like the kind of nonsense I've found written in my journals after being overmedicated.\n\nIf I weren't committed to writing a honest and thoughtful review, I think I would have turned this off after the first thirty seconds.  As it is, I've listened to it several times through, I've written my review, and I can't wait to get this exercise in meaningless angst off my computer lest I get into one of my masochistic moods and succumb to the temptation to listen to it again, rather than do something far more constructive such as bang my head against the wall or beg for a reconciliation with my abusive ex.","4013":"I don't remember this song, so it probably sucks.","4014":"Never received..","4015":"The song itself was great , but the fact that I can't get any help with downloading it to my computer really stinks ! I have never had any problems tranferring songs from the cloud player to my computer , until Amazon's recent changes to the cloud player . I followed all of the instructions in detail to update my computer for the cloud player changes , but still ended up without being able to download .","4016":"Love the \"Stars Fell on Alabama\" song.  She is fantastic singing it.  I heard it on a movie with Tara Nevins singing it so I had to \"google\" it and find it b\/c I just had to have this for my Mom for Christmas.  She loves it also and so does my Sis.","4017":"Couldnt find this song no where this is the best song ever.  Big up christopher martin. This chune go hard","4018":"I love this song!","4019":"Awesome !","4020":"I HATE this song with a passion!","4021":"Version was lacking.","4022":"I've had this album since 2011.  It's not that it's bad quality or bad tunes.  The melodies are not my cup of tea. I'm not a lyrics kind of guy, and these probably are that type of song. Not dance. Not background.  Got it as a free sampler.  First track seems to be fuzzy and not clear as a MP3 should be.  Overall of good technical quality.  Just not my cup of tea","4023":"I bought this because John Rich was featured in it. I'm a huge John Rich fan, but I was a bit disappointed. JR's part just didn't \"fit\" for me. Others loved it, so maybe I'm just missing something.","4024":"Excellent showcase.","4025":"our family have been fans of nickle creek for years, my husband gave me this for christmas, and i do not care for it-we were talking about it last night, chris thile is an incredible musician, he may be searching for himself, but i can't listen to these songs, they are discordant to the extreme and feel disrespectful to the beauty of bluegrass music -imho:)","4026":"will always remain timeless and great to listen too!","4027":"After just 1 listen, I've fallen in love with this album's melodic beats.\n\nThese guys are definitely one of the top up and coming electronic dance music artists.","4028":"Classic Music takes me back to School Daze with Spike Lee, loved loved the video! Must have for good partying!","4029":"First things first when I download music I pay for ,I don't like to be told where to place it. i don't want to play it on sound cloud or in windows media player. It is for my personal hard drive. For my use only....! Once if I payed for it. I can play it on anything I want. your new way sucks. I will be trying other sites now for purchases of my music now on. tell you change it back.","4030":"It's entertaining listening to father and son sings this old Western favorite!  Both are in fine form.","4031":"The Sun Dance absolutely captivated our 18 month old. He would do all the moves along with the video at home, then several days later spontaneously do a sun salutation in public, usually to \"show off\/get attention\" but everyone was very impressed and toddler knew yoga.","4032":"Should say that there are backing tracks on there...I don't want backing tracks and I wasted my time and money.","4033":"Before moving on to form the Thievery Corporation, Eric Hilton had joined forces with Farid Ali as the Peace Bureau, and on their first EP, ACOUSTIC SOULFUL BEBOP BOOMS, they set out a funky, hip-hop path for themselves right from \"Vibe Providin'.\" There's more than a dash of jazz as the horn comes to pep \"The Boom,\" while \"Paradise Dissed\" brings in the bongos. The instrumental versions of the tracks might veer too close to generic coffeeshop music, but \"Cultural Verses\" has a pleasant groove. Luckily both Hilton and Ali would go on to make more memorable music.","4034":"Im a prince fan from his very first album and cant give any of his music last than 5 stars. I have enjoyed all his music and this album is very good. I have this album on viny.","4035":"good","4036":"The band is fairly good for a college band, the vocals are very average, The music choices were not so good and it really did sound like a wife being indulged.","4037":"This 14-track CD started out OK until some lady started singing in Track 3 (Companerita).  The music does not sound Peruvian at all.  It sounds Mexican.  Track 8 is equally bad (Ayawayanatay) This CD is definitely not the easy listening type.  Beware!","4038":"The Michael Packer Blues Band recorded 3 albums from 2003 to 2006. Featured here on the `Best Of' are tracks from \"No Use Running From The Blues\" and the highly acclaimed \"Bleecker - Bowery\" CD. Also included are tracks from the \"Sweet Rhythm\" CD recorded in live performance on February 1, 2006 in NYC, featuring singer-songwriter\/guitarist Michael Packer, Jimmy Vivino, guitar (Conan O'Brien), David Maxwell, piano (James Cotton), Lou Marini, sax (Blues Brothers) and Felix Cabrera on harmonica. Michael Packer, born in New York City, recorded 4 albums for major labels including, Atlantic, RCA and Buddah Records in the 70's with his groups, Free Beer and Papa Nebo. The albums were produced, as is this compilation by Alan Lorber, and are also currently available on the Iris Music Group label.  Michael's new albums include \"Michael Packer Blues Band  Live At Lucille's New York City\" and its companion CD,  \"Michael  Packer\/Sandy Allen - Reunion Live at Lucille's New York City\".","4039":"Great album, but DON'T DOWNLOAD. Absolutely horrific sound, sounds like it's been mastered from a dirty cassette dunked in Pepto-Bismol. Why bother finally making this available when it's thoroughly unlistenable? Will somebody please do this album justice after nearly 30 years of being out of print? For true Kasim fans, the 3 real-deal songs on which Kasim sings lead are available on \"All Sides\" - download these tracks from this collection instead.","4040":"COMMENTARY BY JOE DROUKAS\n\nAt this point talking about each song in detail I think would be a little tedious and redundant. It's just all about a simpler time when all you needed was one pair of Levis, a guitar, a place to play, and people to listen. Like the kid in \"Thyroid Eyes\" and \"Crazy Man Band,\" it's about loading up the van with equipment, riding forever, playing as hard as you can, having some fun, then moving down the road. It's about falling in love, growing up, making choices, chasing down a dream, and saying goodbye. The old \"Yankee Trader\" peddler gave way to Woolworths and Newburys, which in turn, as the song suggested, gave way to Wal-Mart and Kmart, which is effectively killing Main Street. This album brought me to New Hampshire, and happily it has been my home for many years now. And if you drive far enough into the country you still may find that old Yankee Trader selling goods and swapping lies. I've written many songs since this album, which have gone on to have lives of their own. But it all started here. And in truth, I guess Joe Drake and I never really said goodbye, since Joe Drake the rock and roller and Joe Droukas the singer songwriter are still at odds with each other, but continue to make progress.","4041":"This doesn't even sound like the movie theme. I deleted it after one listen.  It's painful.","4042":"The sound of the West, for a slideshow.","4043":"Ok and that is all","4044":"I am not pleased at all with this purchase.  The music all sounds more like midi files rather than actual instruments.  I bought this to use in my music classroom as transition music, but even my students aren't feeling it.  I truly wish there was a way I could return it and get my money back, but with it being a digital purchase, I don't think that is an option.  If you listen to the samples, it sounds like a handful are midi tracks, but not all of them.  After you buy it, it seems like all but a few are midi, and that isn't worth paying to hear.","4045":"I think this entire CD was created using a handheld Casio.  It sounds like MIDI files.  I had hoped that, out of 200 songs, I'd like 5% or 10 songs.  I was wrong.  So far, only two are actually good.  Oh well.","4046":"I listened to see what the quality of the music was like and was shocked to find the themes are cheezy cover versions that in most cases sound nothing like the originals. Not going to waste my money on this tat. I am surprised this sort of thing is still legal.","4047":"I like this song","4048":"I like this song","4049":"Just doesn't sound like the real deal, go for Morricone's version for the best of the originals.","4050":"Great","4051":"Every kid in America should hear this collection of songs and naturally learn them while growing up. This album is wonderful for effortlessly learning about our history and cultural heritage. My kids love the music.","4052":"We absolutely love this album as a whole. Our kids regularly request it. Note that it is slanted towards a very \"Christian first\" approach to history which may or may not align with your values.\n\nOne star though because that Bole Weevil song is incredibly racist and we won't play it. The words could be interpreted various ways but the fake \"Mexican\" accent describing his plan to take your stuff is absurd. Unfortunately we don't always get to skip immediately and the kids yelling out RUDE ONE RUDE ONE TURN IT OFF in the middle of the album every time renders it one star. We aren't Hispanic but I've been enough subtle and not-to-subtle bigotry and see through that one easily. Gross and not so subtle bigotry.","4053":"Enjoyed the music.  Just wish the album was longer.","4054":"Love this song!","4055":"I really love this song. The instruments and the lyrics so good to the ears. Sona Jobarteh is one of the best Afro composers, vocalist and Kora player. I really rate her very high and I just cannot stop listening to her music.","4056":"14 songs did not download after purchase, the other 11 did.","4057":"Couldn't tell you if any good. I can't freaking get to it through their Damn music app. I just want to download it to my phone and be done.","4058":"I got this cd for The Last Duet it Lilly Tomlin.  The other songs are not bad but I don't care for them.","4059":"Listen to this every morning, GOD is good and worthy to be praise.","4060":"This 2 LP set that ABC\/Dunhill issued of one of their biggest artists, THE MAMAS AND THE PAPAS was released in early 1970. It contains most, but not all of their hit singles, plus album cuts. The difference between this and other compilations of the group's music is that this has interviews interspersed between some of the songs. Both John Philips and Cass Elliot were interviewed in 1969, and they give some personal and historic insight about the group in interview snippets. Another difference is that there are some tracks with studio chatter and rehearsal takes, with ONCE WAS A TIME I THOUGHT containing the longest rehearsal of the group practicing the song, and Michelle bursting out laughing because they sang it so fast. I CAN'T WAIT contains some parts of the group trying the song out, while DO YOU WANNA DANCE, DANCING BEAR, and DID YOU EVER WANT TO CRY contain some studio chatter at the beginning or end, or with DANCING BEAR, has John saying at the end that he never really finished the song. All of this is illuminating for the ultra Mamas and Papas fan. But if you may be bothered by hearing some conversation between or at the end of songs, another greatest hits album may be the one for you. This was issued to appeal to the collector, and the original pressing of it as a BOX SET with the booklet is the version to own. The box set version has a beautiful booklet filled with photos, and liner notes entitled \" The Last of the Magic Groups \" by the same writer , Andy Wickham , who did the notes to the group's first album. Lyrics to Mamas & Papas songs are included, but strangely, not every song here has the lyrics, and some not on the set are printed as well. Beware of other printings of this album that do not have the box or the booklet. Both ABC\/Dunhill and MCA issued this album into the 70's and 80's in a regular double gatefold with only the lyrics, no booklet. Earlier copies on ABC\/Dunhill as a double album gatefold may or may not contain the booklet, even though the cover still had printed \" includes many photos \". The later pressings by MCA just stated \" includes many lyrics \" on the cover. Also, this anthology features songs from just the first 3 Mamas and Papas albums. There is not even one song from the excellent 1968 break-up album \" THE PAPAS & THE MAMAS \" , so hits like TWELVE-THIRTY, DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME and SAFE IN MY GARDEN are missing from this set, making it incomplete for a thorough hits collection.\n\nThis album is the last and only time that ABC\/Dunhill still had the original studio sessions of The Mamas & The Papas released on an album. Sometime in the early to mid 1970's, ABC Records threw out master tapes from their storage facilities. Unbelievable but that's the sad case. It may have had to do with the lawsuit that the group instituted in 1973 for unpaid royalties, as ABC would sell their catalog albums as direct cut-outs to the budget bins, and not pay their artist's royalties. How very sad that there are no original studio sessions available of any of the group's master tapes for decades now . That is why there aren't any unreleased songs, alternate mixes, different takes, or remixes done on Mamas and Papas reissues, except for 4 songs on the \" 16 OF THEIR GREATEST HITS \" CD issued by MCA in 1986. Somehow, 4 songs survived with either longer fades or a different mix. Some of the studio chatter\/rehearsal takes of some of the \" A GATHERING OF FLOWERS \" versions have been issued on CD, such as on the \" CREEQUE ALLEY \" 2 CD set in 1992, and on the UK \" COMPLETE ANTHOLOGY \" 4 CD box set.\n\nIn addition to the collector's item appeal of the original box set with booklet, ABC\/Dunhill also released a promo only 45 with similar album cover artwork that contains some additional interview snippets with John and Cass.\n\nSide One: STRAIGHT SHOOTER, MONDAY MONDAY, TRIP STUMBLE AND FALL, GO WHERE YOU WANNA GO, I CALL YOUR NAME\nSide Two:DANCING IN THE STREET, ONCE WAS A TIME I THOUGHT, CREEQUE ALLEY, DANCING BEAR\nSide Three:I CAN'T WAIT, DEDICATED TO THE ONE I LOVE, FREE ADVICE, DO YOU WANNA DANCE, SPANISH HARLEM\nSide Four:GOT A FEELIN, NO SALT ON HER TAIL, WORDS OF LOVE, I SAW HER AGAIN LST NIGHT, DID YOU EVER WANT TO CRY,","4061":"If you enjoy guitar music, you will love these guys! They are mostly acoustical and just amazing to listen too.","4062":"I bought this and the Fedoseyev recordings the same day. This is the more typical performance of the two (not as briskly paced the Fedoseyev), very enjoyable, nicely played, with decent sound. Certainly can't go wrong buying this.","4063":"While all of the Paul McKenna Band's recordings are well worth buying, this particular CD should be on your shelf.  The songs range from political to fun, from traditional to very modern, and all of music is very, very good.  Highly recommended.","4064":"Such a wonderfully queer song. Be sure to watch the dance that it was written for by the choreographer... beautiful.","4065":"I accidentally bought this song thinking it was Marconi Union's song Weightless. When I realized I bought the wrong song, I gave it a chance. I couldn't listen to the whole thing. It was painful. I contacted Amazon.com and got my $0.99 back.","4066":"This is NOT the Marconi Union Weightless...totally different.  Sounds nice,\nbut NOT what I was looking for.  The search engine is deficient here.  Erika\nJanugar should not have shown up when I had entered Marconi Union.  Listen\nbefore you buy...I did...so I didn't buy it!!\n\nYou can get the real Marconi Union Weightless legally, free, on the Radox\nFace Book page.  Turns out they funded it and are giving it away right now.","4067":"I can never described this music, the closest description for it is epic music. Oh music you've mostly heard from trailers. I plan to buy more,\nFuture World Music, Two Steps From Hell and Audiomachine are all my favorite styles of music. They'll be played over and over again.","4068":"There are a lot of selections and they vary a lot. I enjoyed it.","4069":"I think I found this album randomly one time I searched here on Amazon for this band. I had never heard of it, though myself and other Ace Enders fans had both of his previous albums. Still to this day I haven't met one person who knows about this album - and I feel this is a tragedy. Which is why I decided to review it.\nThis album is a little different than the first two. I would say the first two have somewhat of a pensive\/experimental feel, but while this is still existent in Gold Rush it seems that instead of super long track titles and background noise Ace has turned to his ability to make simple, yet irresistibly charming music. Acoustic guitars, simple but exciting drum beats, tambourines (i think), shakers (like maracas. Not the religious sect that came from the Religious Society of Friends), and Ace Enders vocals make up 90% of the surface of every track. Someone could argue this album is more 'pop' than the previous, but I believe that would miss the point because it seems that Ace is actually going against the grain of experimentation that is all over in indie music now and just writes with his heart using the traditional mediums. The lyrics really connect with you in a way that pop never could.\nbut on past my rant: I'll review the tracks:\n\nGold Rush - opens up with percussion including the shaker and Ace's amazing vocals, and never looks back. Great track that deserves to be the title track. It will remind you of some of the tracks on The World We Know with it's pensive feel (and especially lyrics) and a chorus that you just can't resist singing along with. (8\/10 rating)\n\nLame Duck - Beautiful mix of vocals, drums, and acoustic\/electric guitar riffs (and later on the shakers) that no one else could pull off as well as Ace. This track doesn't have anything in it to make it stand out from the rest of the album which is why I rate it lower (though I love lyrics), but it still has the same charm. (7.5\/10)\n\nConnected - Amazing catchy guitar riffs really make this song, that while overall has a slower tempo than most of the album it still seems it would be the best candidate for a single. If I wanted anyone (regardless of their genre tastes) to be curious about this album I would show them this one. Check it out (10\/10)\n\nComplications - While this track seems overshadowed by \"Connected\" because it is relatively similar (tempo, instrument makeup) but doesn't have as catchy of guitar riffs, but the more I've listened to it, it has come to speak for itself. Make sure you wait until the last 30 seconds for everyone to come in with their parts - you'll be glad you did. (8\/10)\n\nHad To Be There - Don't discount this one because the intro sounds almost identical to \"Complications\" (same drum beat and similar acoustic riffs), however this track is a gem. It has one of the best choruses and bridges on the album. While I'm never sure what the lyrics are talking about sometimes, I love singing with them (whether the lead or background vocals). (9\/10)\n\nDon't Leave Me - though this track might not seem as good to someone not used to Ace's unique voice (though he does temper it with some subtle distortion or something), the percussion in this song and the catchy singing of the track title should win you over. Also this track seems the most mature for some reason. Perhaps because each section (verse, chorus, bridge, outro) seem different from each other yet stand on their own as good.(9.5\/10)\n\nMisery -  after listening to this album this has become my new favorite. Probably the simplest song on the album, with the verse having only guitars and drums, and the chorus repeats exactly and doesn't seem cluttered at all. Though it is really simple and might not be anyone else's favorite, I just absolutely love the lyrics because of the way he defines Love. Normally i'd probably give it an 8\/10, but because I love the lyrics it gets: (10\/10)\n\nGods - This is the one track where the electric guitars really rule over the acoustic. Interesting harmonies that do work but don't sound 'beautiful', rather seem more like just rock music. At first this song was too repetitive for me (and therefore exemplified the only shortcomings of the album) and so I really didn't care for it. Interestingly enough I actually came to really like it myself, which is why it gets an: (8\/10)\n\nTrain Stop - This song is refreshing if you've listened to the whole album chronologically because its verse drumbeat is different from all the other tracks. There's a great mix of Ace singing quietly and also giving it his all. Electric guitar riffs go throughout the background and make it never boring to listen to. While it finishes the album off well, it seems almost to leave you wanting more on purpose. (8.5\/10)\n\nIn conclusion this album is what it is and won't make excuses for it's possibly repetitive music and themes. Overall, this album has simple music put to some of the best lyrical writing out there, and deserves a chance from every Ace Enders fan. When compared to the previous I Can Make a Mess... albums, this one earns it's spot as equal to them.\n(Hopefully this is helpful! this is my first album review so feel free to let me know what you think)","4070":"By the time that I notice that I had picked the wrong Hells Bells, if was too late.  I wanted the original, this version sucks.  I have the CD but didn't have the time to dig it out, so I thought paying the $.99 was worth spending rather than the time It would have taken me to dig it out.","4071":"This review is actually a repeated opinion of another cover work that was bought at the same time. But my opinion still applies to this work for the same reasons.\n  \"This is a talented band. I think they can be proud of the quality of the music they play. However, they are not AC\/DC and they should be more forthcoming in titling and labeling this product they are selling. Is there confidence so low that they cannot present themselves clearly and openly as providing cover work? Or are they just scheming to make more money by having the public buy their product without realizing these are not the original songs? Go to youtube and listen to the original versions. I think it is worth the effort to search and buy originals.

Not only does this qualify him as a total hack without a creative bone in his body, it also creates problems for anyone else who wants to use that royalty-free track as background music for - let's say - a video on Youtube. Youtube's music recognition software recognizes the music in your video, and because this idiot has somehow gotten his \"song\" published, they mistakenly credit him for your music track. This dude isn't the first to cause problems for people across the internet by doing this, and he probably won't be the last. Google has got to fix this problem with their software to account for musical hacks like this guy. If they don't, pretty soon no one will be able to use any Apple track in their videos.","4084":"Please tell me this isn't serious, using stock apple piano music tracks with \"rap\" over it.

I have also been a big fan of her writing since she asked me to write a \"blurb\" for her first book, \"Piano Girl,\" several years ago. Five CDs and three books later, I'm a bigger fan than ever! Goldsby recently released a new book and companion CD both titled \"Waltz of the Asparagus People.\" The book is subtitled \"The Further Adventures of Piano Girl,\" and each chapter is an autobiographical story, most of which occurred after the tales in \"Piano Girl.\"\n\nThe fourteen piano solos on the companion CD correspond to the stories in the book and richly illustrate them with sonic colors and textures.  They also make me wonder how Goldsby could ever feel that her playing isn't \"good enough\" for a concert stage. What I DO understand is the feeling of absolute panic at the thought of a full room of people sitting and listening intently rather than simply enjoying her music in the background over dinner and drinks. Goldsby's piano touch is graceful and elegant, but is also completely approachable and inviting. Eight of the tracks are originals, five are her arrangements of favorites, and one was composed by her daughter, Julia. Some of the cover tunes would be considered pop music in most pianists' hands, but Goldsby adds such a warm and personal interpretation to them that she elevates them to a higher dimension and makes them her own. Her original compositions are even more personal and come from deep within. All fourteen pieces are exceptional with no filler anywhere on the album. The covers include Yiruma's popular \"A River Flows in You,\" The \"Feather\" theme from \"Forrest Gump,\" the theme from \"Romeo and Juliet,\" \"Comptine D'un Autre &Eacute;t&eacute;, L'apr&egrave;s-Midi\" by Yann Tiersen, and \"Air on a G String: The Glass Piano\" based on JS Bach. I love all of Goldsby's originals, but especially like \"Mother's Hands,\" \"Till I Lost You,\" and \"Little Big Soul.\"\n\nIncluding its whimsical title, \"Waltz of the Asparagus People\" is exceptional in every way and is sure to be on my list of Favorites for 2011. I give it my highest recommendation.","4105":"Yes...I admit it!  I'm a HUGE Debby Boone fan (and Marie Osmond fan too...but...DON'T JUDGE ME! LOL!)\n\nDebby's first two albums, the rushed debut (to build-on the hit \"You Light Up My Life\") and the better 2nd album, \"Midstream\" showcased just how good Debby's vocal chops were.  However, it wasn't until her perfect 3rd album (\"Debby Boone\") that made this guy stand up and shout \"I LOVE THIS WOMAN\"\n\nThe album starts with 2 fantastic songs, \"Girl Don't Come\" and \"Jamie\"...uptempo songs for Debby and she just nails them both.  Track 3, \"The Worst That Could Happen\" makes me forget that it's remake and fits perfectly after \"Jamie\" but before \"With All Of My Love\". Ending Side 1 is \"I'll Never Say Goodbye\", a ballad that entices you to flip the album over for more.\n\nSide 2 begins with Debby's version of \"Choosey Beggar\", one of my alltime favorite songs by this woman.  The Country-ish \"Breakin' In A Brand New Broken Heart\" follows and it's just awesome.. Next, comes the only hic-cup on the album, the disco-ish \"Meet Me On The Dance Floor\".  Not my favorite and a bit out of place on a collection of near perfect songs. \"You Took My Heart\", a nice ballad follows all leading up the THE ULTIMATE CLOSING TRACK \"I'd Rather Be Alone\".  A PERFECT beautifl ballad sung like no one could sing. I LOVE IT!\n\nSome label needs to get this classic on CD...like...NOW!!","4106":"I stumbled onto this song on YouTube which has some wonderful versions by this Artist, however this is not one of them.

As with the first two CD's in the Intermediate series, Chantal makes the learning process both informative and enjoyable.\n\nThe first part of the CD covers the Formal Imperative, which is the form you're most likely to need unless you're visiting friends or relatives.  Commands are kept simple but useful: \"Vada in quella direzione.\" (Go in that direction.)  One example shows that even a simple phrase like \"Mi dica\" (Tell me) can change meaning depending on the context: \"Si, mi dica?\" (Yes, what can I do for you?)\n\nMost of ths CD is devoted to the Future tense, equivalent to \"will do\" in English,\nusing widely-used verbs in common situations.  Some examples show how direct and\nindirect object pronouns are combined with these verbs in sentences: \"Glielo diro\nappena lo vedro.\" (I will tell him it as soon as I see him.)  Other examples\ndemonstrate the Future in idiomatic phrases: \"Se le cose non andranno meglio, ci\ndaremo al bere.\" (If things don't improve, we're gonna take to drinking.)\n\nFor those who are familiar with LLI Intermediate Volumes 1 & 2, this CD will feel\nvery familiar, continuing in Chantal's molto simpatico style.

I should note that I'm also a fan of his earlier album The Destroyer.\n\nThis album starts off great.  The first track, Control Drug, is exactly the style that I was hoping for - nasty synth sounds with drum & bass \/ jungle style drums and distorted vocals.  But things quickly go downhill from there.  The next track, Shivers, is plain boring.  It's one of those slow and simple songs that Alec Empire simply shouldn't be doing because it's not what he's best at.  Stick to what works.  Although I certainly dislike the cheesy, dated, 4\/4 \"house\" style of the third track, Baby Skulls, the rolling bassline, the cool synth sounds, and the way the song builds, all make up for it.  It makes me nod my head and crank up the volume, so what more can you ask for?  Track four, If You Live Or Die (Live 2008), was surprising to hear for the first time because I like that song (it's from The Golden Foretaste...) but there's really no reason to hear the live version more than once.  It's not much different than the non-live version.  I would have preferred to hear new material such as the next superb track, Vampire State.  It's kind of dubstep sounding but more unique than most of the dubstep that I've heard.  1000 Eyes (Film Version) combines the dullness (slow and boring) of Shivers with the pointlessness (another old song?  really?) of If You Live Or Die (Live 2008).  The album ends with t.o.t. which has some kind of dated blip sample in it that reminds me of old Aphex Twin material, over another one of those house beats.  It's a very uninteresting way to end this album and it left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nIf you are also a fan of the same Alec Empire albums and styles that I am, I recommend taking advantage of this \"mp3 download only\" album and only downloading the tracks Control Drug, Baby Skulls, and Vampire State, which I'd give 4 stars average.  But the album as a whole - 3 good tracks, 2 tracks that put you to sleep, and two versions of old songs - is somewhat disappointing.","4130":"I used Shazaam to find out the details of this song, which i heard as part of a DJ set that a friend of mine recorded and made available to his friends. The Nobody Remix is slightly different than the one in the DJ set, though, and it's not quite as good. The mixed in beats don't quite settle in my opinion. I still like it, but it feels like it needs tighter mixing on rhythm and relative volumes of different pieces.","4131":"I won't claim that this CD sets a mood; the tone of \"My Boyfriend\" and of \"Hide From Me\" are completely opposite. However, if you want something very definitely not mainstream pablum, but rocking enough to crank down the windows and turn the radio up, then I recommend Dick Tracy Must Die.\n\nYes, I own the CD. Yes, I DID crank the windows down and turn the volume up...on a very hot day, too.","4132":"I was looking for the Color Purple soundtrack version and this is like some weird home recording.

I'm sure I own over 1,000 CDs and DVDs, and this is the worst of them all.\n\nWish I could give it ZERO stars.","4148":"This disc is really nothing more than midi music recorded on multiple channels. If you want to know what it sounds like, listen to a Casio keyboard playing public domain classical music. Rubbish of this kind of  is available many places for free. All they did was add the extra channels, but this adds no nothing whatsover to the experience of listening to this and is of very poor quality. Again, it just sounds like an electronic keyboard playing on your sound system (awful). There is nothing artistic or creative here whatsoever. That is the reason that you do not see any samples here.\n\nHere is the kicker and what really throws up the red flags though: It seems that all of the positive reviews here are fake, designed to convince you that this is a actually a good product worthy of buying and listening to. I have investigated the histories of all of the 5 star reviewers and commenters for this series, and you can do the same. This is a known guerilla marketing tactic perpetrated, I believe, by one person. You can see this for yourself by simply clicking on all of the reviewer's (and commenter's) names and looking at their other reviews, comments and lists. You will find that they are ALL for this series only, with a very few for others, BUT even those few are cross-linked right back to promote these. In comparing them you will see the exact SAME type of language usage, idiosyncracies and mispellings throughout and across all of these, under all of the different aliases. This very same person also seems to lurk here and almost immediately responds to any honest reviews by attacking the reviewer and often posting a new fake review under a different fake alias in an attempt to bury the honest review, again with the very same language characteristics and consistent mispellings. It's likely that the same will happen to this review as well.  It has already happened to my review of another disc in this series (Bach). You can even find other message boards on other sites with the same exact types of comments, language, etc. If you are doubtful of what I am saying, order it anyway and see for yourself. I'd bet you'll find yourself returning it while shaking your head in disbelief after first listen.\n\nI hope that Amazon will take some action against these dishonest and sleazy marketing tactics. Amazon reviewers have steered me clear of other bad products and consumer rip-offs while greatly aiding my many purchase decisions, and I feel happy to be able to give back to the community here.","4149":"unique","4150":"It's a song","4151":"Awesome album.

Also, not all the tunes were the same as what they use in the video.","4155":"The album is as ugly as the cover is.","4156":"It is fantastic when u can purchase an album and all the tracks are fantastic.  I listen to this album when I am working.  It's very exciting and energizing.","4157":"The band hails from northern Virginia and I got to see them a few times and they were tremendous.  Bass player Christian De Mesones is a master with the funky groove lines and soultry feel.  The band overall is a great mix of talent and they blend well together to create a jazzy-cool feel.  Most of all, this is an example of local talent from Northern Virginia that is available for all to hear.  It is great to see Groove Skool making it big time, they deserve it and hard work and dedication does pay off.  My favorite song is Latin Jive and it is just another example of their versatility to create a mix of Latin Jazz and Soul.  The songs are all different in style and sound that will appease to all Jazz, Latin Jazz, and soul music fans. A must have.  Good luck guys and keep it up!\n\nJesus Enrique","4158":"Sounds just like the version we all heard when it first came out. Not like the one for sale on iTunes?","4159":"Great song and brings back some memories when times where different","4160":"Do you want to get into a dance mood and have fun? This song is perfect. It's fun, energetic and great to have fun with. I choreographed it for Zumba and it's one of my class's favorite songs. Destra, overall, is great - this song is one of my favorites.","4161":"from the creative minds who brought you avpm, avps, mamd. its starship!!! got ta love um. this is gunna be totally awesome. (music playing in my head)\n\nit makes me so gleeful to see this here","4162":"It's Baa, Baa, BLACK Sheep not Baa, Baa, BAA Sheep. They don't even check the correct lyrics of the Mother Goose Songs.  Even our 4-year-old granddaughter corrects them.  What the heck?","4163":"Disappointed.","4164":"I was disappointed that the singing on the cd was sung by what I call operatic voices.  I had hoped it would use the voices from the Mother Goose Club videos I watch with my grandchild.  Also, not all the tunes were the same as what they use in the video.","4165":"I ordered this cd after watching mother goose club videos on you tube and me and my son were so disappointed with the voice and music. We were expecting the same voice music which we watched on you tube. I can't even return as i opened it with so much excitment  to hear the rhymes.\n\nI just hate it .","4166":"I got the experience of seeing him perform this at the Harrison County Fair this past weekend and it is such an amazing, fun song!!  #FFnation #FrankFosterMusic","4167":"The first story \"The Case Of The Roving Corpse\" is missing at least one part. The announcer says to \"tune in next week for part Four\" but there are only two parts in the collection. The worst thing you can do with a mystery is to leave out the ending making the mystery a complete mystery!\nAlso the story \"Rendezvous With Death\" is actually a shortened version of \"Death On The Nile\" which is not the fault of the seller. It's what the broadcasting company renamed the episode when it was produced.\nAdditionally, Harold Huber may not be the actor playing Hercule in every episode since the voices are not the same in all stories and there isn't always a mention of who the actors were.\nSince some of these episodes are available for free in various internet Old Time Radio sites you might want to check them out before spending your money on this set.","4168":"i'll never buy audio this way ever again, because the audio couldn't be downloaded.\n\nOthers may have had a different experience.","4169":"great music","4170":"I gave this two stars not because of the incestuous subject matter. The two stars are for orchestration. Personally, I hate musicals that use cheap keyboards to replace or fill in for musical instruments. Most of the songs in this recording have that cheesy string setting, the kind you'd get on a cheaper brand keyboard or what would be used in karaoke clubs. Maybe this was budget or maybe they wanted it to sound cheesy. In any case the sound of the band or orchestra in this recording is really bad. The singing is ok, not broadway great. The price to download or buy is a little high for the so -so quality that you are getting. In terms of the story, you don't get much listening to the recording. Listening to the CD I picked up it was a  love story between siblings and going to prom. That's all I gathered from the recording. I have not seen the movie. But.. I'd guess the movie is not any better then the CD. If you are going to write a musical about a subject like incest or anything taboo, put some money and time into the CD. Make it at least sound good orchestration and singing wise... even if the plot is thin, cheesy and taboo. I would NOT download this recording, you'll only delete it later.","4171":"Very uplifting!!!","4172":"This is beautiful, inspiring, and deserve many awards than those thrashy artists who write nothing but garbage in their songs. This song is dedicate all children of Afrika and Black children around the world who are going through hard times!\n\nWe all will survive!","4173":"Great job, great performance","4174":"I just love it I am going see if they will sing at my church I like it because there so my driffent people in and let you know the story off my saver","4175":"This is the best song and album I have heard in a long time. I love the music that's not too hip-hop.","4176":"I bought this by mistake due to the confusing tile. This is not Carlos Vives but REYES DE CANCION.","4177":"This song totally fits the situation We The People find ourselves in Today!","4178":"Low quality recording.  Bad mix, too.","4179":"Good","4180":"First time I have heard the Collingsworth Family.  So many old songs that I grew up with -- I loved it.  What a blessing it has been as we have listened to it over and over!!!!  I got it for Jesus is Still the Answer - but I love the The Meeting -- The Holy City --and I like all of them...","4181":"I've used this type of wind sound before, but I've enjoyed this one much more than the others. I use it in the background while I write. Great at setting the mood for a snowy winter scene!","4182":"I wish I could know how long or in this case how short a recording is before I buy it had I known before hand that this recording was only 30 seconds long I would not have bought it!","4183":"I purchased this song because I heard the song on the radio.  Amazon makes buying mp3's very easy and with their cloud player all your music is saved that you purchase from them.","4184":"Great.","4185":"Very pricy for just a single $$$","4186":"Not what I expected - all ge kept saying is \"The King is back\" and all the places Elvis viisited. Disappointed","4187":"This is not the explicit version...","4188":"This album is truly contagious! God is good!","4189":"After hearing this on the radio; I had to have it. Now since this one song. I think I will probably purchase more of their songs.","4190":"This is a great Chicago compilation!","4191":"It was in very bad shape","4192":"this song made me cry...Lovely song and good when you just want to listen to something calming","4193":"Love it!","4194":"Solid example, good riffs and strong voice.","4195":"Awesome praise and worship","4196":"I like the lyrics and I especially love the music played. The video is good too. I'm not sure exactly why this one appeals to me, it just does.","4197":"Mana never disappoints.","4198":"Wow, just like old times! If you can listen to this and not be moved you'd better check your pulse.","4199":"I love Christian music. And after listening to this song on the radio a few times I absolutely love this song","4200":"I cancelled that purchase","4201":"I would not have ordered anything but the original.  The Title fooled me.  Not bad.  But it's not Bob Seger!","4202":"I love Robyn- outstanding artist. These remixes remind me of what could have been if she didn't produce and record her own music. These are pretty boring electro-dance remixes, they add little to the original song.\n\nThe one good thing after hearing these remixes was the new appreciation I have for the composition and production of the original Robyn songs.","4203":"This was not the song I wanted....noticed it immediately...never downloaded, yet Amazon will not let me return it for the correct one!","4204":"I was disappointed with this.  Should not have bought it. I listen to this type of music all the time, and this piece is.... boring. Not annoying,\njust not worth listening to.","4205":"A wonderful example of a young trio that works !! Gerald Clayton is surely the diamond here but also the rythm section works great , displaying great arrangements , specials and so on . An higly recomandable work , fresh and full of life .","4206":"Awesome song for COLD to start back up with! I was anxious when I heard about COLD re-banding and writing a new CD, but I never thought it would sound this good. If you have ever liked anything in the rock or alt-rock genre, purchase this song, you won't regret it!!","4207":"What a super group. What a great sound and awesome song writing. I would have never though of putting these guys together in a group but it is amazing. Too bad it will never happen again with these exact people. RIP John Lord....","4208":"Perfect. Needed it for a concert","4209":"Just not very good.","4210":"Be aware - This is the dance mix version NOT the original song.","4211":"A well-documented piece of music.  The choir was fantastic and also was the orchestra.\nI especially enjoyed the national athem.","4212":"Absolutely loved this song when it was performed live during their wedding!","4213":"Great, simply great. I've bought both his albums and really enjoy them. I recommend them highly; buy them, enjoy them","4214":"Beautiful flute music, my every day delight. Never get tired of it. If you consider yourself spiritual, you'll be in heaven.","4215":"We gave away hundreds of thousands of these Summer 2006 ....\nIt's a sampler.\nIt doesn't even have liner notes.\nCome on.","4216":"Great sounding album with really deep content. Creates an amazing atmosphere in my art studio while I'm working or relaxing. Pure spiritual inspiration, timeless enjoyment. Instantly stops  this rushing, greedy, superficial World. Removes stress and emptiness, never get tired of it, my everyday cure.  Candles, insence, this music and I'm in Heaven.","4217":"This album is just fantastically awesome! It's a shame that this band is so underrated! You should really but this album! From start to finish the whole album is a thrill. Some say it sounds like nine inch nails but I say it sounds like awesome! No but seriously its a great album.","4218":"sent the entire wrong song,,,some weird chinese music","4219":"After seeing Jake Clemons in concert at a small venue in Vermont, it was clear to me that here was a man unafraid to write and sing from his heart, to give his soul voice and encouraging others to do the same.  The energy put out there by him on stage through spoken words and his music is so honest that it reaches into your own heart and soul.  Now having some of the songs I heard live is like reliving a moment of deep feeling, good vibes, and realizing that who he is, he can be nothing but honest.  Love him!  And his saxophone playing speaks volumes as well, as though Clarence is doing a duet with him.  As Jake has said in speaking of his uncle, \"It takes two.\"  The entire band exudes wonderful energy as well.  It is clear Jake is careful who plays with him and finds the best.  I hope this band goes far, as it brings a new and more pure energy to music.","4220":"There is a skip in this version of the song, it's super noticeable and super annoying. It's on the word 'farm' in the second line.\n\nVery weird and throws off the whole song, screwing up the rhyming scheme of the first part.","4221":"There was a skip in this version of the song!  Please use a new track of this song, there was a skip in it at the beginning!","4222":"I rated only 4stars for the simple reason I have another version on my blackberry phone that on is sinking hot but this one is good I recommend this","4223":"I don't expect this album to one of the alltime best sellers since it's release is ill-\ntimed and most of the artists involved had no connection to John Lennon, esp-\necially Paul McCartney. Understand up front that I am no Beattles fan. I like Geo-\nrge Harrison solo, especially (I Got My Heart Set On You, for instance), even his\nvideos (The Moose singing in there is precious!). Only Robin Zander of the Cheap\nTrick bands has some connection in that the original Cheap Trick's Bun E Carlos\nand Rick Nielsen did studio work with Lennon on his double fantasy album with Yoko\nUgly, er, ah Ono (she isn't!). Two or those songs got cut from the final project at the\nlast minute. Zander, comes off well here. But I suggest you get Siren - All Is Forgiven\n, w\/ Jon Brant.","4224":"I took a chance and paid .99 for the CD. There is a reason why it was being sold so cheaply.","4225":"only liked 3 songs. wanted more broadway like material. many songs too young for him. hope next cd better. ok","4226":"I am a bit biased as Amon Amarth can do no wrong in my eyes. This is an older Album of theres but a good one nonetheless.","4227":"Fortunately, I wasn't tricked into buying this particular CD.  I have accidentally purchased a MIDI CD before, and what an unpleasant surprise.  I don't know why these are made, or who gets paid to make them, but they're terrible.  The software is mid to low quality, and the programing is very robotic.  And, worst of all, they are riddled with mistakes!  Wrong notes, wrong chords, wrong rhythms...  these digital instrument soundtracks are an insult to the composers they're stealing from.\n\nDo yourself a favor and buy the actual release.  Alexandre Desplat's score for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and 2 are wonderful.","4228":"Is the explicit version of Call Me really something the world needs?  If that's what you want, happy days! you can get it.","4229":"None of the sound like a \"punk\" remake at all.  Most simply sound like a poor cover of the original at best, and a terrible cover at worst.","4230":"This is a collection of truly awful covers by no-name bands trying to play great works created mostly by fabulous bands. Even the title, \"Punk Goes 90s\" is a miss since various tracks in the collection -- whether one is talking about the covers or the original tracks they so badly emulate -- aren't punk at all. It's hard to understand how this collection went so wrong. My wife and I are planning to have a yard sale in two weeks, and it occurred to me that if I had a physical copy of this collection, it'd be the kind of thing I'd put in a basket to sell for 25 cents. I'd feel guilty unloading it on someone for more.","4231":"A nice variety of selections, melodies and lots of different tempos suitable for pointe.  I'm glad I found this...it supports the pointe work where regular ballet CDs do not as well.","4232":"I believe this was their single off this release which is one great pick,all the songs on this Cd are really great. This Cd was my first introduction to this German metal band. This song has all the trademarks for a metal anthem in it wth a great riff,thundering bass,excellent drumming and superb singing from Andy Franck. This song and their older material waves the powermetal genre full fledged! Get it!!!","4233":"This could be my favorite pop album ever. I don't even know if you can solely categorize it as pop since there is a rock aspect to it, but I can't put it down. It'll be on heavy rotation for a long time. Favorites are \"Keep It Up,\" \"We Don't Care,\" & \"Glow in the Dark.\"","4234":"Best cd by far by fates warning","4235":"I'm not going to repeat what other 5 star reviewers said here.  But suffice it to say that 'Parallels' is a progressive hard rock masterpiece, with songwriting depth and musicianship that is... ahem... unparalleled!  Fates Warning has a way of 'painting pictures' with their music.  They can be pensive, melancholy, or downright balls to the wall metal.  But they do it stylistically, with chord and time changes that have garnered them respect worldwide!  These guys are \"musician's musicians\"!  The 'give and take' styles between Jim Matheos and Frank Aresti put them in the company of other great rock dual guitarists.  Mark Zonder's drumming is clockwork, and Ray Adler is in top form.","4236":"Hayler needs lyrics to match his almost unmatchable, soaring voice.  Thrills & chills occur when he's using his upper register.  Some songs\/vocals are muted, though, as if he's dummying down his voice for a Christian audience.  Professionally trained by a world-renowned teacher, he could have accepted offers to sing opera in prestigious places around the world.  For all his talent & training, he hasn't accrued a massive library of recordings.","4237":"guitar heaven....riffs that are uplifting, phantasmagoric, blistering, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah----just a great instrumental piece to kick back to","4238":"This song was not suitable to her voice. It was bland and boring. She needs to go back to the drawing bord. On the positive side the little girl is cute on the cover. Not my favorite at all.","4239":"You have to love Sophie Milman's swinging arrangement of this old baseball standby.  I can imagine Ella Fitzgerald giving a nod to Milman's style.  It's well worth the 99 cents you'll pay to own this version.\n\nFor a real treat, watch Sophie Milman perform \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" as an extra on the DVD documentary&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Jews-and-Baseball-An-American-Love-Story\/dp\/B004HJ0ZTQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story<\/a>.

That's quite an accomplishment using a baseball song.  How refreshing in these times where tawdry is the rule.","4240":"Havn't heard this album, but I don't need to, to know the picture on it is NOT Ann Sothern (her name was Not 'Southern') The picture is of Ann Sheridan. What teenager put all this together?","4241":"This is a unique interpretation of one of the most inspirational songs for me.  However, the mastering of this track leaves something to be desired, with a very abrupt cut at the end of the song.","4242":"Great song, always makes me smile. The Lonely Island has funny songs you can groove to. I will buy more of their music.","4243":"Beautiful song by a beautiful lady! Worth the money, this song has always been a favorite of mine, so while working up a project for our pastor appreciation day at church it was my first choice in songs to describe just how we feel about him. He was moved to tears when he heard it.\n\nThanks so much!","4244":"Wonderful !","4245":"quick download","4246":"Not the original recordings!\n\nIf you're looking for the hit versions of these songs, they are not on this c.d.\nGet this one instead\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Kicks-the-Anthology-1963-1972\/dp\/B0009OUBCO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kicks the Anthology 1963-1972<\/a>","4247":"Perhaps these tracks were recorded by the Raiders, but they are not the tracks that got air play in the 60s.  A huge disappointment.","4248":"This is in my opinion the best Dirty Beaches record. This is a perfect record for spacing out or chillin' with your pals. I got it nice and quick. The first time i played it I thought it was warped, but it was just thawing out. I ordered it in the winter and it sat out side for a while. Once it reached room temperature it played like a dream. Great record. Great price.","4249":"I don't really know how to describe this album with some pithy title. It's mostly rockabilly type melodies, but grungy, crackly, mumbley. Lots of people have invoked David Lynch in describing it. Definitely, if you like Lynch's soundtracks, you will love this. I just happened upon Dirty Beaches and I can't stop listening to it.","4250":"If you're a lover of music and big band then this will be right up your alley. A lot of this compilation reaches back well into the early 40's before we were in WW2. It's kind of like a time machine into yesteryear, they just don't make music like this anymore, period. A journey into simpler times. It's just lovely.","4251":"I thoroughly enjoyed this album. Here are the track listings:\n\nDISC 1\n 1  Blues In The Night\n 2  Where Or When\n 3  On The Sunny Side Of The Street\n 4  My Old Flame\n 5  How Deep Is The Ocean\n 6  Let's Do It (Let's Fall In Love)\n 7  I Threw A Kiss In The Ocean\n 8  I'm Glad I Waited For You\n 9  I Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me\n 10  Fools Rush In\n 11  Sometimes I'm Happy\n 12  The Way You Look Tonight\n 13  Blues Skies\n 14  Can't Help Loving That Man\n 15  Blue Moon\n 16  Summertime\n\nDISC 2\n 17  I Can't Give You Anything But Love\n 18  Georgia On My Mind\n 19  Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\n 20  Solitude\n 21  Lullaby Of Broadway\n 22  I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)\n 23  I Get A Kick Out Of You\n 24  Stormy Weather\n 25  Birth Of The Blues\n 26  I Only Have Eyes For You\n 27  How Long Has This Been Going On\n 28  Bali Hai\n 29  I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out Of My Hair\n 30  S Wonderful\n 31  Swingin' On A Star\n 32  But Beautiful\n\nDISC 3\n 33  This Can't Be Love\n 34  Imagination\n 35  Goody, Goody\n 36  Riders In The Sky\n 37  Lover Come Back To Me\n 38  I've Got A Right To Sing The Blues\n 39  Be Anything (But Be Mine)\n 40  Just One Of Those Things\n 41  Lover\n 42  I've Got You Under My Skin\n 43  I Didn't Know What Time It Was\n 44  Love Me Or Leave Me\n 45  Easy Living\n 46  My Heart Belongs To Daddy\n 47  Black Coffee\n 48  Somebody Loves Me","4252":"Sounds lie it was recorded from 50' away, no bass, no oomph...\nWill sound great on an old AM radio or any 4\" speaker.\n:(","4253":"I stumbled upon a youtube video or poor quality of a band called Frankie and his Fingers a little while back. The song sounded like it was pretty good but again the quality of the video wasn't so I couldn't really tell. I kind of left it at that but later on I decided to go back and see if I could find a better quality video of the band. I ended up on a myspace page where they were announcing a new record release along with a change in name, to By Land or Sea. I immediately fell in love with the songs and got to listen to that song that I wanted to hear from the youtube video - Hell Broke Loose. That song is so good.\n\nGreat songwriting and really catchy songs, I really hope that they become more well known (but not sellouts) because they really have it. I would love to hear these songs with a little better production quality but I really like the 'raw' feeling and the songs sound great. The album is good all the way through, definitely support this band by buying this album!","4254":"Song interrupted by speech.  Enough said.\n\n filler word filler word filler word filler word  filler word filler word  filler word filler word  filler word filler word","4255":"I actually have this double LP that I bought back in the day. It is basically a combination of these two albums sold here, \"Reach For The Sky\" and \"5'll Getcha Ten.\" I also have the self-titled album \"Cowboy\" which one of my kids must have used for playing DJ, although none will admit it! All of Cowboy's albums are excellent in my opinion.","4256":"WHERE ARE THE FOLLOWING CLASSIC HITS THAT SHOULD BE ON THIS CD:\n\nI USED TO LOVE H.E.R.\nTHE CORNER\nRESURRECTION\nHEIDI HOE\nRETROSPECT FOR LIFE\nTHE 6TH SENSE\nREMINDING ME\nSOUL BY THE POUND\nGHETTO HEAVEN.... and many, many more!!!!\n\nThere's only 1 word to describe this project- INCOMPLETE. Common, if you signed off on this, then I don't know what to say except, \"DO-OVER\"","4257":"I have all the 13 releases. This one is definitely one of the top 5. Enjoy listening to track 13 of the first CD. It takes you to a different world. Ot track 2 of the 2nd CD.\nHighly recommended","4258":"Great!","4259":"Ok","4260":"One their best songs","4261":"Wrong song. Didn't like it.","4262":"My daughter loves this song and a few others that I've had yet to find on Amazon.  Hopefully, we'll be able to get our hands on Trick and Treat soon.  Great sound and exactly what she wanted.","4263":"Matt Kennon is out there rocking the country music world. Thanks to Thunder 106 Matt has been embraced by the people of New Jersey. Be sure to check out Matt's song  \"You Had To Pick On Me\", which deals with the topic of bullying which he wrote after a discussion with his sister who is a grade school teacher. My personal favorite is \"Drive it like you stole it\".","4264":"The \"Highways Call to Me\" offers lyrics, melodies, and string virtuosities that reveal talents rarely found and\/or expressed. Imagine Leonard Cohen (vocals and lyrics) teamed with Allison Krauss (strings and vocals). Hauntingly good;and that's just not the \"Low Down\" -- a fine addition to any music library from two young artists.","4265":"This album is beyond good!  The music and the lyrics speak loud for passion for life! Good easy listening.  Great vocals & harmony and the instrumentals are five star quality.  I recommend this to every email contact I have!!!!!! and anyone that enjoys listening to good instrumentalists making good music!","4266":"love it","4267":"Liked","4268":"This is just music. No singing.  Would be best for background accompaniment for a kids program.  I was looking for words and music.","4269":"Very nice song. I love Anders Holst","4270":"Every time I think their songs can't get any better. . . .  they do! This is music that parents will happily play (over and over and over again) and so fun for the kids too. BTW- that goes for ALL of their music. We met them once and they are as awesome in person as you could imagine! My almost 5 y\/o daughter is THE biggest Recess Monkey fan- bar none (and I think I come in a close second). Buy this CD. You won't be disappointed.","4271":"Not the original recordings","4272":"Awesome song.  It is beautiful.  It is about using your instinct and doing that thing you have an inkling you should do.","4273":"Although sung by many notable performers, such as Placido Domingo, this rendition by Carlos Gardel is the most authentic. Small wonder he is referred to as \"the most famous singer of Tango ever.\"","4274":"Could be better not like the country song - doesn't seem the same - Paul Hardcastle could of cone better","4275":"This Rap, Hip-Hop song has cut its teeth on the bilboards, before advent The Transporter (movie). It's a hard hitting tune that is not for the faint of heart. It tells the story of love on the Ghetto street, and describes the rules one lives by to get by. The beat is steady hard hitting, and driven. It's great for cruzing in the whip. Ya feel me!","4276":"OUr family loves this recording.  I wish it would be released on cd.","4277":"WTF","4278":"Wonderful piece of music. Encouraging words. If you have ever been in a situation where you wondered whether God is sleeping then listen to this song. God is too wise to be mistaking and too good to be unkind. If you don't understand Him, just trust Him you will be safe with Him.","4279":"Amazing! Love it!","4280":"Love it!","4281":"i like the smaller group sound with this song  ..  vocal balance is pretty good  ..  song is very very gripping","4282":"cool song","4283":"This is the worst song ever written!","4284":"I really liked this song by Christina Perri, but I like this one just a little bit better. The cast of Glee are all great!","4285":"Just like I remembered, when I had the cassette... lol... what are those?... excellent.","4286":"This song skips and it didn't come out good.","4287":"Awesome R&B throwback to the 70s!!","4288":"Those who are blessed to know Parker Bradway know that he would never sing, record, publish or endorse anything \"explicit\". This is a mistake that I hope Amazon will rectify immediately. Parker's music is uplifting, wholesome & represents the young man himself. You can't go wrong being a fan of his.\n\n'Carolina Blue' is a song about two young people (in 'Carolina'-I prefer to think \"North\") who care about each other but know they have to follow their dreams. There is not a harsh word, much less a curse word, in the lyrics at all. The track is professionally recorded & the music is played by a professional country music band.\n\nParker Bradway is the real deal and I am delighted to support him. It is my honor to write this review & my blessed privilege to know him.\n\nNashville will love him, too!","4289":"Bought to make a CD for my 9 year old niece. This is part of an album Fun Rock, I listened to as a child and my Mom's tunes growing up. Loved that it is downloadable. I was able to make the CD and my 9 year old loves the songs. \"..really likes it and thinks they are funny.\"","4290":"Some day Miss Sparks will wake up and realize that she is a ballad singer.\n\nShe moves people with her emotion and talent.\n\nI am moved every time I watch her sing the National Anthem, \"I who have nothing\", \"Woman in love\", \"Broken wing\", etc...\n\nMeanwhile she will continue to produce this kind of nonsense and drivel.\n\nSad...Such a great talent...","4291":"I make slide shows for younger grades, this music is just right for them.  Bouncy tunes, clear lyrics, as they use to say \"it is easy to dance to\" - catchy stuff.","4292":"Originally issued by Buddah in 1969, and reissued in expanded form by the UK Cherry Red label in 2010, this historic collection of bubblegum music is now available for domestic&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/digital-download\/dp\/B004Z0PBLY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">digital download<\/a>&nbsp;through Sony's Legacy imprint. The fourteen tracks of the original LP were pulled together from the biggest hits of Buddah's Kasenetz-Katz production team, including the 1910 Fruitgum Company's \"Simon Says,\" the Ohio Express' \"Yummy Yummy Yummy\" and the Lemon Pipers' \"Green Tambourine.\" Brilliant melodic hooks, crisp studio productions and child-like lyrics combined to produce songs that were instantly likeable (except, of course, to self-righteous rock fans who'd long-ago lost track of music's simplest pleasures) and more importantly, memorable. Though aimed at the pre-teen crowd, the songs' surface-level innocence often harbored erotic and psychedelic allusions that were sufficiently camouflaged to escape AM radio's gatekeepers.\n\nThough Buddah didn't corner the bubblegum market (the song of the year for 1969, \"Sugar Sugar,\" was on Don Kirshner's Calendar label, for example), their output is easily the largest concentration of the genre's exemplars. Cherry Red's (and now Legacy's) enhanced reissue drops two tunes by the Kasenetz Katz Super Circus (\"We Can Work it Out\" and \"I'm in Love With You\"), and adds seven titles, including the 1910 Fruitgum Company's \"Indian Giver\" (which post-dated the compilation's release), Salt Water Taffy's \"Finders Keepers\" and the Shadows of Knight's swampy \"Run Run Billy Porter.\" This is both a good place to start a bubblegum collection and a terrific spin for those who are already fans.

We need more music like this!","4294":"This recording quickly convinced me of two things. The first is that Teseo might well rank among Handels ten best operas, and I can imagine fans who might place it in the top five. The second is that this recording is a dreadful choice for full appreciation of this work. The music is brimming with enough beauty and drama to outweigh the plots minor flaws: some illogical decisions by the title character and his would-be nemesis Medea, and a literal Deus ex machina ending. This recording, however, taken from a live performance in Stuttgart, merely suggests what a good version might be. The distracting stage noises and an outburst of vulgar shrieking at the end of one duet might be bearable if the male roles originally sung by two castrati and a woman had not been entrusted to counter-tenors whose skills proved utterly inadequate to the music. During the last forty years we have left behind the appalling habit of the first German revivalists who transposed the castrato parts down for baritones. Unfortunately, the rise of the counter-tenor has often led to an alternative that is only a little better. There are only a handful of counter-tenors world wide who can sing these roles well enough to prevent the informed listener from yearning for the parts to be handed off to a competent female singer. None of them were hired for this performance. So, in between some solid-to-superb singing by the women in this cast, we are forced to endure florid arias that painfully reveal the deficiencies of the counter-tenors technique, and tender, lyrical arias by the same singers that range from adequate to woeful. Those allergic to the goat-bleat of the overstrained counter-tenor should stay away. Its possible that these singers may have something to offer in the studio, where they would be untroubled by the need to be heard in balconies, could enjoy a schedule that sidesteps the mounting fatigue of a live performance, and would have the opportunity for endless retakes. Id imagine that they are embarrassed enough that this performance was preserved in recording, so I won't pile on by naming them and detailing which aria found each of them at his worst. These performances merely convinced me that to enjoy Teseo to the full I probably need to secure the highly-regarded version of Mark Minkowski.\nOne technical note: if you decide to buy downloads of individual aria trackswhich is a plausible decision, given the bad bits youll want to avoidyou should know that two of them in Act Five are mislabeled. The track listing for the aria \"Si tamo, o caro\" follows an error of the libretto and attributes the number to Teseo (Franco Fagioli); it is actually sung by Agilea (here Jutta Bhnert) as Handel intended. And Teseos aria \"Tengo in pugno ldol mio\" is attributed to Egeo, although if you make the first click to purchase the aria you will then see the correct attribution.","4295":"Received this record today old sleve with record hanging out , side two is scratched and skips very bad at the being. Record had no padding. I won't be ordering from this vender again.  Mph  I can't resale in this condition.","4296":"order the wrong thing,other than that it was great.","4297":"Honestly, I only downloaded this song because of Gallavich.\nThat being said, it is a wonderful tribute to blues, and it is worth your listen.\nNow that that's out of the way, please spend some time watching Shameless (US), and catch this song in the Mickey wedding scene. (No spoilers, I promise. I didn't even scratch the thick surface.\nCatch it on Amazon, Netflix, or Watchfree.to .\n(Season 7 starts Oct. 2nd, 2016!!!)","4298":"Didn't feel like a song they would normally do.","4299":"Panic at the Disco!!!! Say no more!!!!","4300":"I first heard this one when I was going through some other videos on youtube. It has definitely become my new theme song!","4301":"This album is intricately linked from track to track.  They flow together wonderfully hitting raw emotions of love and loss, friendship and family as well as pure energy throughout.  Love I Love presents an edgy track that resonates as my favorite while stand out songs include \"You are Good Enough\", \"October\", and \"Smile\".  Its well worth the purchase and more than a few plays on your cd player, ipod, computer or what have you.  Enjoy.","4302":"This download has a glitch, or blank spot, in it. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS VERSION ! I had to purchase a different copy to get a clean sound.","4303":"this album is very short (only 37 minutes) and all of the tracks are extremely repetitive. don't waste your money.","4304":"WHY IN THE HECK DOES ANY1 WANNA HEAR ABOUT YOUR FEET HURTING GO SIT DOWN AND STOP SINGING! PLEASE, JUST STOP SINGING!","4305":"The perfect Mother's Day gift!  Finally an album that appeals to all of us regardless of age.  A true collection of some of the best songs in American Music.","4306":"My two boys absolutely LOVE Jennifer's CD! They have listened to it hundreds of times! They both love \"Everybody Bounce\" and \"It's Bath Time\"! Every song is great and fun to sing along to. I have given this CD as gifts to my friends with kids and everyone loves it! We have seen Jennifer in concert many times and she is very talented and does a wonderful job engaging the kids!","4307":"If you like the jazz guitar give this man a try. Smoother than 15 year old bourbon.","4308":"I didn't buy this not sure how I got it but song sucked lol","4309":"WHAT A FANTASTIC...STEP BACK IN TIME.. TO THE, \" GOOD OL' DAYS\"!!","4310":"I've had this CD for a while and I keep re-listening to it hoping it will get better. It hasn't. I love Aretha and have for years. This is her worst CD that I have ever owned by far. Do not buy this CD.","4311":"While I had the misfortune not to be present when this amazing performance was given, I have had the good fortune to have seen Ken live several times.  If you appreciate blues played extremely well and sung with more soul than you can imagine then give this disc a listen.  One guy singing and playing guitar never sounded so rich and full.  The disc has artfully played standards as well as a number of originals that highlight Ken's great rythmic style. If you want to know what remote is... look up Naples Idaho on a map sometime.  If you pass through, look Ken up.","4312":"Willie Blount's voice is unique and anointed.  He is a well-keep secret in CHRIST!  What a blessing he must be the his household of faith.","4313":"This one was really \"difficult.\" The first side has some cool vocal chants, but the second side is some really tortured sax soloing. I'm not really into the howling and screeching stuff, especially when done without much accompaniment.\n\nIf you like that sort of thing, then this would probably be as awesome for you as it was painful for me.","4314":"For the uninformed -- Bach didn't compose this, it was Henry Purcell.","4315":"It reminds me of an old, late in the evening, smoky, bar room classic!  I only wish the entire album had the same orientation.","4316":"I returned the CD, it was a 'Rip-off'. The song title; \"Lift Every Voice& Sing\" was NOT on the CD. I'm sure the persons that produced this CD used the TITLE to sell the CD. Also. on the CD was song titles that was NOT Recorded on this CD.","4317":"Great!","4318":"I used this music for my church choir. Due to the clarity of the music we were able to do a spectacular job once we performed the song!! Easy to download.","4319":"Good Sound Quality","4320":"This album was certainly good, there is no question about that.  I did feel however like it was lacking something, for this I will give only 4 stars.  Josh Vietti is awesome though, if you like his work help support him by adding this album to your collection.","4321":"Too much distortion on the music (from just the intro).  Sounds like a home-made recording.","4322":"Awesome remake by the Allies!!!  Love their version!","4323":"Gangsta violin?  Yet...it works.  Wild.","4324":"I love Paul Oakenfold.....this is is really a good piece and one of the good selections off of this collection. It has a lot of good strong beats to it but easy to listen to.","4325":"Almost impossible to download.","4326":"I am making a short movie video with my calculus class and ran across this song when searching for the artist. I purchase the music and am using it in the movie video.","4327":"Broadway continues to live in the archives of music available on Amazon Prime and it's music platform.  Most enjoyable to be able to find it and listen to it once again.","4328":"Love her as a person and love her music! Cant wait for her new album to come out! :)  .","4329":"perfect","4330":"THIS SONG IS AWESOME!!!!","4331":"I listen to many types of christian songs this song helps set the atmosphere for worship just you and God.....fell in love with it the first time I heard it.","4332":"singing along with this song is easy and leaves you wanting.  always praise him..thank you earnest pugh for this song.","4333":"Bad music,thanks.","4334":"Very nice music. It sort of reminds me of my trip to Cuba, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Has a good mix of modern and old type samba.","4335":"So a worms life was a great album, not as good as previous but still great, these sessions sound exactally like the last 3 failed Dummies albums (I don't care, Ohh La La etc) so I can see why this crap was not released.  Basically a prelude to non inspired times.  I hope we get a good album from these guys again sometime.  The first 4 were good....what happened!","4336":"Where to begin? The tracks aren't titled, some songs end in the middle of the song, and there of repeats of about ten songs therefore there are only in fact 90 tracks. DO NOT BUY","4337":"This looked like a great deal, and the sound is much better than Volume 1. No wonder. In great part, this is NOT music of the 1920's. I mean, Begin the Beguine (1935) and Besame Mucho (1940)? Some of the clips sound like they are in stereo! And while one of the reviewers exaggerated, you can toss half of the last twenty as exact duplicates.","4338":"I ordered this for background music on videos I post on youtube.  I have been challenged several times with copyright problems with some of the music from this cd.  So its not all royalty free or else I don't know what im doing.","4339":"love the CD but half of the songs are repeats, it is actually 50 tracks the rest are repeats. had they been honest and just put 50 tracks I would have given it more stars. I really don't want repeat tracks. what a F-ing con...","4340":"Wow! These guys are trying to merge trance with chant with a little of everything else in between mixed in. Makes my head hurt honestly listening to it. I like a lot of most music and a little bit of everything else, but this is just sloppy IMO.","4341":"It's a cover by Karmin, it has to be awesome!","4342":"I had heard some buzz about this album in various places, especially it's unique blend of Eastern and Western influences, so out of curiosity I decided to download it.  I was not disappointed;  this album offers a very tasteful synthesis of the two cultures.  The mood of Beete Pal includes happiness, mixed with sadness and contemplation.  The album is full of engaging colors with both Indian and Western instrumentation and harmonies-- in particular, listen to Raaz ko Raaz (one of my favorites), Madhosh (another favorite), or Kyon Maane to hear how it works together.  (Please check out the samples;  my words here can't describe the overall sound to my satisfaction.)\n\nI appreciate that the execution of the music on this album is very strong, and even from listening to the samples, you will be able to tell that this album was put together with a lot of care.  \"Hats-off\" to Nandini, the band, and the production staff.\n\nLastly, for those of you interested in approaching Indian music, this is an album worth getting.\n\nReally nice work, Nandini Srikar.  I look forward to your next project!  I am definitely a satisfied customer and music listener, as I have enjoyed every track on this album both at home and at work.","4343":"wouldn't play","4344":"Well... I \"bought\" this \"Royalty Free\" track for use in my class' film. As soon as I uploaded it to YouTube I got flagged for copyright infringement. Buyer beware!","4345":"I heard this band for the first time at Founders Festival 2012 in their hometown of Grand Rapids, MI.  Founders always has some great national acts on the bill and I was really excited about the two headliners. Imagine my surprise when this band stole my vote for best in show.  It is rare to see a group of musicians that can play such complex music as tightly as they do life.\n\nNaturally, I had to purchase one of their albums when I got home.  I am a big fan of jam music.  I love bands like Phish, Widespread Panic and Umphrey's McGee.  Why are those other bands nationally famous, while UV Hippo is not?  Random chance.  Their music has melodic accessibility and rhythmic and harmonic sophistication.  Worth a listen.","4346":"Problem with upload and purchase redundant. copies","4347":"Problem with upload and purchase redundant  copies.","4348":"Great fun from a great lady!","4349":"I wish I'd gone to a \"box store\" to listen to this CD before I bought it. Artist is very unusual and talented but it's just not my kind of music. Ish I could get my money back on this one!","4350":"Thought I would like with checks of samples of music, but found just not my style, so would pass on further albums","4351":"I am a dilettante when it comes to the work of Meredith Monk, and this was a great introduction to her work! I heard excerpts of this on her interview on National Public Radio's \"On Being\" and had to hear the rest of it. The performances here are energetic and dynamic, exploring the full range of emotion and technical capability. Monk draws from a diverse sound palette including mixed chorus, two vocal groups to augment her own ensemble; string quartet, percussion, wind instruments and portative organ. The result is a stunning composition that is as stirring as it is contemplative; joyful as it is somber; ecstatic as it is tranquil.","4352":"I would rate the song a 5 star but the MP3 version is terrible. It is supposed to be a remastered version but the sound engineer over compressed the recording and turned the volume way up. This removed all the sound dynamics leaving an overly loud flat recording with limited frequency response to boot. This has got to be one of the worst MP3 recordings I have ever heard! It is definitely not worth $1.29. Since I have had this experience with other Amazon MP3's,I will no longer buy MP3s from Amazon.","4353":"My favorite Vokab song.  I love them and all of their music but this one is my go to.  Thanks!","4354":"I happened to see the video for this song on television one day and really liked it. I downloaded the MP3 on Amazon and have really enjoyed it. Thanks so much.","4355":"Same old Same old","4356":"Nice song sounds good and has a good beat ,its a hit at the clubs , Also has a good story","4357":"I was looking for music as a background for my \"clown theme\" haunted house effects for Halloween this year.  This is perfect.  VERY creepy.  I'm thinking that, between the props and the music, I'm going to need a booth offering a critical incident stress debriefing group next to my house for anyone crazy enough to approach it :)","4358":"Incomparable singing. Do yourself a favor!","4359":"It was a gift but my daughter loved it.","4360":"One of a kind recording by the irrepressible one of a kind, Miss Peggy Lee.\n\nAlthough God has called her home, she Thankfully left behind her irreplaceable music.","4361":"A weak impression by a bad singing group trying to sing a great song.  Very disappointing it is being presented as the original TAMS","4362":"i used to see this band every week at a small shop in west hollywood. this record is so fantastic its a shame this band is extinct. enjoy.","4363":"This guy dresses his kid in blackface as Ray Rice and sent his son to school with a black doll dr gaged by her hair. So, he's a great Christian to buy music from.","4364":"Great music!!","4365":"Great drinking songs. This is a real good duet CD. Some of the songs were written by Red himself. Most of these songs are sad but true to life. I have another CD by Red  called \"Cheatin' Heart Motel\"  which is very good also, but I can't seem to find two of his other CD's which I would like to own. They are:  \"Neon Bible\",  and  \"The Bartender\". If anyone out there knows where I can find these besides Amazon please let me know. You will definitely enjoy this CD. Highly recommended if you like drinking songs.\n  Guitar Bob","4366":"Love this! Raphael Saadiq is a musical genius!","4367":"I kind of liked the sound and it showed promise, but this track is nothing but a warm-up or short sample of just over sixty seconds, not a real track. Very disappointing!","4368":"This is a cute song from this album, but the other songs in the album are so much better. I recommend this album, but this song is the least enjoyable.","4369":"Love the album.","4370":"One of her best","4371":"It is a perfext song for rumba dance. I Like it.","4372":"White Rabbit is an 'ok' follow up to the band's same name first cd, but no where near their potential. Maybe this is why they broke up...","4373":"I don't know what else to say about this song. It came from a Transformers movie, I liked it, so I downloaded the MP3.","4374":"You can feel the emotion in Michael Grimms voice in this song.  I love it.  This bluesy soulful song is a must in your library.","4375":"beautiful song i can listen to it over and over again.","4376":"Love anything by Michael. Would recommend it over and over again. Money well spent","4377":"Didn't dig this CD by Grimm produced by Don Was. Drab songs,stinko production by Was. Some tunes were a little country flavored and night too bad.\nRob Mitchell","4378":"Love the song, and this version is cleaner and better suited to younger audiences than the original Amy Winehouse version.","4379":"I'd heard the entire album from which this song was taken years ago. Frankly, it's the only one of all of them that I really like (enuf to download). I much prefer the old Yes works, when the original band was together.","4380":"not what I was looking for disappointed","4381":"Great song and great group. The Lonely Island group is funny and the songs are great. Best best best  great.","4382":"Wish I could give no stars! This CD only has one song on it. Wish I had read the reviews below! I will not purchase music from Amazon in the future and will read reviews on items if any I purchase in the future.","4383":"I wish there was truth in advertising...\n\nThe title of this song indicates that it is a \"full instrumental\" with piano but the short sample for listening starts right up with vocals.","4384":"I WORK OUT 2 THIS & I FEEL LIKE I'M A DALLAS COWBOYS CHEERLERADER GREAT FUN!!!","4385":"Excellent product.","4386":"Eh","4387":"ex husband hacked into account and ordered them. No idea how it is working.","4388":"Had it on loop on accident and didn't realize it. Just enjoying it over again several times.","4389":"I noticed that the release date for this MP3 version of \"Latin Beat\" doesn't quite indicate the \"original\" release date of the Francis Bay LPs that led up to the present offering. Bay's Big Band recorded a number of sessions at the Brussels Worlds Fair in 1958. Included were arrangements of big band classics such as the Dorseys, Glenn Miller, Harry James, and Ted Heath. As a kid back then, I bought the whole catalog, with \"Flag Wavers\" being my personal favorite.\n\n\"Latin Beat\" is a brassy compilation of Prez Prado \"hits\" along with some other \"latin\" standards. The Bay Big Band was more than competent, and the stereo recordings (still a bit early in the stereo era) are nicely engineered\/mixed. This is a rich translation of classic latin rhythms.","4390":"Nothing like the original and really a waste of space writing about it. Since I have to, I will just write again. Wait for the original.","4391":"make sure you can find the instrumental online for free. the one i got was a very low quality and didn't sound good like the one used for the original song.","4392":"Great cover by two very talented singers that obviously put a lot of hard work into their rendition.  I'm glad to purchase this song in support of them both.","4393":"Although released on the expanded 1991 release of Queen's second album, it, as were with most of the \"bonus tracks\" released that year as part of their 20th anniversary album catalog release (not counting those '91 remixes), was not remastered.\n\nI bought this remastered album from Japan when it was first remastered in the mid-2000s. Those contained no bonus tracks, so I was greatly elated when it was included on the 2011 American 40th anniversary album remasters.  Having \"See What A Fool I've Been\" nicely remastered for the 21st Century is an essential track for us Queen completists.","4394":"I just love Freddie.","4395":"Probably my favorite Queen song","4396":"Love me some Freddie!  One of my favorites by Freddie--great song--not sure how they can still call themselves Queen without him.","4397":"If you are Hard core Queen Fan you want everything. these rendition of Queen songs are for me great. Demos, Early versions, Live versions or instrumental version of songs I enjoy to listen a lot\nThis is part of the Deluxe extended albums released short time ago.","4398":"Saw them in Manistee, MI, went home and bought their CD.","4399":"Classic Queen enjoy the long intro on this version of the song off the original album; yes they where still called albums when this came out","4400":"need customer support to get file - purchased many mp3's from amazon and this has not happened before.  How do you get support with amazon?","4401":"Great song","4402":"Beautiful song. Buy it.","4403":"Love the heart and soul behind this artist and his worship community.  Keep pressing into His love and rest, and wait to see what happens!","4404":"New sound is awesome, especially vocals.  But, there are only 7 tunes on this CD; felt like I was ripped off.","4405":"I have purchased almost all of DL&Q CD's and this is the first and only one that I have been disappointed in. The driving bass line is so dominant that it made it hard to hear everything else. This CD has a more contemporary, beat driven sound, which I personally am not a fan of.","4406":"Forced emotions are something that scores shouldn't do. Over my lifetime of listening I can tell when a score is trying its hardest to evoke a certain emotion. However, the listener should never be identifying the emotions a score is evoking; they should be feeling the emotions. Such is the case with the score to Atlas Shrugged. The emotions here are surface level, and while the arrangements are wonderful it can't seem to penetrate anymore than surface value.\n\nRight from the first track that propels you into motion you get the sense of forced emotion. We then segway into the \"John Galt Theme\", which is covered in schmaltzy heartwarming sensibility. Now, the score does manage to go into some wonderful orchestrations that carry some emotional weight. However, once we get into the adventurous tracks the melodies somehow get bogged down by their complexity. They aren't overly complex melodies, but nothing ever builds towards anything grand. The synthetic sound of the whole soundscape doesn't help things either. Clearly this score was meant to be played by a huge orchestra and clearly synths are being used as a replacement. Now I can't speak for what the budget was, and it is very possible that was a limitation. But the score as a whole has a \"mockup\" quality to it.\n\nBy the time I reached the end I didn't feel like a progressed anywhere. The music didn't take me anywhere and in the end that's what a score should do. It should push the story, build with the cutting and not try to force it. While Atlas Shrugged isn't a bad score, it also isn't a good one. I don't want to identity emotions. I want to feel them.","4407":"OK first, let us get this straight. There is no conspiracy against the movie. The movie is bad, it is like a grade Z effort made for Lifetime TV. Love or hate Rand and her views, the movie is hilariously awful. The movie tanked due to 2 factors: the movie wasn't marketed to a degree that a general audience knew it was there, so, people can't go see it if they don't know it exists. And then finally, the movie was just awful. Silly, poorly staged and acted.\n\nThe score however is very nice and at 7.99, it is a deal to get the download!","4408":"Not what I was expecting. Great flute player, was expecting different music.","4409":"Tom and Bernadette are incredible...Don't make musicals like this anymore.","4410":"Me Gusta mucho","4411":"What a voice & wonderful lyric lines. This dude should be on the top 40 radio. Great mixing on the instruments & well balanced with vocals. Fresh & a feast for the soul, my bet is we hear a lot more form him soon.","4412":"The first and last songs are reminiscent of the early crossover (Metal-Punk) style that I fell in love with as a teen, the two songs in the middle are much more on the early alternative side before it became diluted. All in all worth a listen.","4413":"What a Holy Spirit filled CD!!! Every song is truly annoited! Grace and Joseph hit their first Cd out of the park.","4414":"ok","4415":"As has been pointed out this is baby music.  However, as much disdain as there is, the baby music market is huge.  I suppose you could dance to this but it is a bit sluggish \/ lacks energy \/ is impotent.  The first portion of the song is virtually a cappella where her voice is accompanied only by a drum beat and then later accompanied by a lacklusterly produced background.  Her voice does not sound auto-tuned.  I think she actually has some raw talent and it is displayed here with some middle eastern influenced vocal gymnastics. So, Beiber fans take heart. As a one star review from a relative codger like me may reflect poorly upon a song that (as I struggled to get through a listen or two) may be just right for your longing of a boy who wouldn't be able to start a chain saw.\n\nOn a side note,  I don't understand why someone selected this song off her EP as ANY of the other songs would have scored much higher in this forum.","4416":"I wanted so much to like Breanne Dren.  I love discovering exciting new artists, and I felt drawn to this pretty young pop singer looking out just a bit shyly from the cover of her first EP.  \"No One Else\" is a song with a sweet, albeit simple, premise: she's traveling the world, yet can't help thinking about and missing her sweetheart.\n\nThen I actually listened to it.  Dren (whose birth name was Breanne Durenberger, without the gratuitously exotic umlaut) is 23 years old, but you'd never guess from the sound of her voice - or the content of her lyrics (\"I read that message that you sent me\/Baby, like all the time\").  This is teenybopper pop, and not especially good teenybopper pop either.  The singing is adequate at best (I'm still trying to figure out whether it was actually Auto-Tuned, or just SHOULD have been), and layered over a backdrop of synthetic sound, it's catchy, in the way that advertising jingles are catchy: faintly entertaining in a trivial way and simultaneously just a bit annoying even BEFORE you find you still have it stuck in your head five hours later.\n\n\"No One Else\" reminds me of nothing so much as Rebecca Black's \"Friday\" - but at her age, Dren should know better.  And unlike \"Friday,\" this song isn't quite bad enough to collapse in on itself by one of those weird laws of quantum physics and become sort of painfully awesome in its sublime awfulness.  It's just an amateurish pop song.  If your idea of good music involves synthesizer-dependence, pitchy vocals, and insipid lyrics, \"No One Else\" should be right up your alley.  If you're over the age of fifteen, don't even bother.","4417":"My son could do better....not the best Christian rap I've heard.","4418":"I must have purchased this through my cell phone. I have no Idea that I had purchased this item. All I know is that its a song of some sort. Not sure how it happened. How do I ask for a return on something like this?","4419":"I feel bad giving this track by Friendly Fires only two stars.  I didn't dislike \"Blue Cassette\" exactly, but I just couldn't honestly give it that third star.  The lyrics, which speak of the poignancy of memory, are mediocre.  The musical setting is more noisy than melodic, and at the beginning and end there are some weird, annoying sounds reminiscent of music played backwards.  It's not a bad song, but it's nothing special either.  That's too bad, because the album art is perfectly glorious.","4420":"Like the old saying \"you're beautiful when you're angry,\" Carmen Rodgers sounds really good when she's bitter. And she effectively captures the stages of hurt, anger and resignation of a love gone bad on her new EP, The Bitter Suite.\n\nIt's been six years since the Dallas-based singer won a sizable number of fans with her debut album, Free, and those fans have been not-so-patiently waiting for more.  Rodgers' full sophomore disc, Intermission, a complete story of a relationship gone good, then bad, then good again, will be coming later; but she is now issuing a big chunk of it (the \"gone bad\" part) with the digital release of The Bitter Suite.\n\nRodgers lets the listener (and her man) know from the get go where things stand, opening with a defiant tone on the neo-soul midtempo, \"Tell Your Story\": \"Tell your story at the door \/ 'cause I've heard it all before \/ and now I'm not so sure if I want this love anymore.\"  By the time of the terrific next song, the acoustic gem \"Home,\" Carmen is more reflective but just as resolved to end the relationship: \"You say you want to come home \/ but home is where the heart lived \/ and I just want to move on \/ so should you.\"\n\nMale listeners be a bit unnerved by the interspersed table talk of a group of women throughout the disc, who verbally lump men into a pretty bad lot of liars and cheaters.  And Rodgers feeds on that talk, vowing not to get hurt anymore on the nervous, jazzy \"Never Again,\" another EP highlight. But as the disc approaches its coda, she begins to come around, realizing that there may be some value in all that damn pain, and she finishes in a more pensive mood on the ballad, \"Better U Than Me.\"\n\nThe Bitter Suite has the benefit of holding together quite well as a thematic piece and having songs (particularly \"Home,\" \"Tell Your Story\" and \"Never Again\") that can stand on their own as singles.  But, like opening a book in the middle, one can't help but want to hear the whole story that surrounds The Bitter Suite, one that will be told on the full album, Intermission.  For now Rodgers fans can celebrate the welcome, enjoyable return of the Texas musical chanteuse.  But they'll want more...soon.","4421":"Not labelled as radio edit. Make sure you sample the track before purchase","4422":"It would be better to never make an album Than to make a load of worthless sheit  to fill up a playlist...  it's a shame that korn was a decent band to rock to at one time. This is a load of inaudible dribble spewed from a no-one lead backed by a group of nothing pretenders","4423":"Makes you want to get your money up! Currently working overtime and studying real estate online...","4424":"This album is awesome. The lyrics are deep, intelligent and have power to transform hearts and minds. One can't help but be blessed.","4425":"I have really enjoyed this album. His music is very relaxing.\n\nBFinn","4426":"Love Shawn Brown music for the kids! awesome","4427":"Why is this cd so much? I am an american and I love this JRock band, but why is it $20+. This is the only place I can find to buy the CD legitimately, but the price seems odd.","4428":"In the two (as of today) 5-star reviews of Liturgy's \"Aesthetica\" on Amazon, both reviewers mention how Liturgy is \"breaking all the rules\" or \"going against the trends\".  That is true...to an extent.  They don't wear corpse-paint, the album cover is white and, well, that might actually be it. (And can't we say that about a LOT of BM bands?)\n\nYou see, the PROBLEM is...they aren't going against any trends, they are part of a trend --  the trend of young American's getting into Black Metal (which, in itself isn't a problem, the conflict starts when their leader starts acting like the Scholar of Black Metal).\n\nThe BIGGER PROBLEM is...their music contributes nothing worthwhile or exceptional to the black metal scene. I could forgive the attitude of the band (pretentiousness) if they actually provided notable output, but this is lukewarm black metal. The primary influences of Burzum and Darkthrone are there, a little mid-period Satyricon. Nothing new.\n\nTHE BIGGEST PROBLEM is...while these youngsters are getting attention for this mild offering, other great new black metal bands are not -- Negative Plane, Nightbringer, Oranssi Pazuzu, and Blood Cult, to name just a few.  Also, some of the forefathers who Liturgy mooch off of have expanded so far beyond their core that it makes this album sound like a regressive work.  Arcturus, Ulver, Abigor -- they taught us that the rebellion of Black Metal could not be contained to what it was, and what Liturgy is.\n\nComing back around, the problem here isn't that these guys are posers, it is that they are just another bland, cut-rate black metal band among thousands.  If the album cover sported a grainy black and white photograph and a pentagram, it would of flown under the radar and ended up in a used bin somewhere.  Liturgy is thriving on what they say, not on what they do. Classic American youngsters, all talk, no walk.","4429":"Wanted to like this, based on the one song that was out there, but that one song does not represent the whole.\nI enjoy some dissonant, weirded out, and acquired-taste styles of music, but considering the best-of-2011-list-raves you can find about this album, this is some ridiculous excrement. It's the 2nd record, cd, or album of any kind I have ever returned. To each, their own.","4430":"I love Al Marconi's music! It has helped inspire me to create beautiful paintings as I listen while painting and coming up with new ideas. Even my husband says this music I've been playing is awesome, he's a devout Acoustic Alchemy lover. Thank you Al for your amazing talent and I hope you keep creating from your heart! I will be telling my friends who enjoy this kind of music about you and how easy it is to get your work from Amazon and put onto Ipods and Iphones. Fans in Cali","4431":"This album goes nowhere and that's a shame.  There are some really good ideas in here that get squandered quickly or leave you hanging in every song.  I couldn't even detect where the choruses were on most of the songs.  I had to read the lyrics to find out.  It kind of sounds like they are trying too hard.  Song structures are all over the place.  I like being different but to be different just to be different just doesn't work.  Have an idea of what you are doing at least.  At times it sounds like a bunch of different riffs glued together to make a song.  I really wanted to like this when I found out that Kelly Sundown was in another band.  His talents are wasted here.  He is great as usual but the music leaves you wanting more and it just never comes.  I will not abandon them for this album because there are some good sections but most of the good has a lot to do with Kelly's talent as a vocalist. On the sticker it said Rock Hard Magazine gave it 9 out of 10 and this is the future of metal. I don't know what Rock Hard Magazine is but....Yeah right. Please don't insult bands like Kamelot, Symphony X and Nevermore with that statement.  THEY are the future.  It also said for fans of Iced Earth, Nevermore and others.  Iced earth's music is mediocre at best so yeah they are right there with them.  But to say Nevermore?  You have got to be kidding me.  I'll ride this until I hear another album from them.  They need to focus their ideas.  This just doesn't grab you at all.  If you listen to this pay attention to Kelly Sundown.  This album has its moments but leaves a stale taste in your mouth.  Sorry guys.","4432":"anything kyo itachi touche's is golden era hip-hip add a visonarie lmno and u got sumthin good ta listen to inn the headphone's born again is a mello but still bangin album also check out rustte jux and kyo itachi hardbody hip-hop classic.","4433":"amazon sells 256 MP3 and charges the same price of other stores that sell clearer and higher quality 320 MP3.

I will be dancing to this one for sure!","4435":"I'm not much for modern country and most folk music, but after seeing these guys on some Appalachian music show on our local public broadcasting channel, I was very much interested in obtaining their music in some fashion. There are at least 4 great tracks, the rest are nothing to turn your nose up to. Its just nice instrument playing and proper vocals.","4436":"This is a bad karaoke version of the song.

What a tremendous disappointment!\n\nThe 60th was fun, full of surprises, and had lots of twists and clever adaptations.  The newly released Nod to Bob2 is just old and tired, without a single cut which I would look forward to listening to again.\n\nI bought this CD pre-release.  It's like that old line from the movie, \"Hey, you screwed up.  You trusted us.\"  Never again.\n\nTom","4441":"music sounds like it was recorded in someones basement and the vocal were not even that good not recommended at all","4442":"We were really looking forward to hearing this CD but it is defective. It will not play at all. There's a noticeably darker ring at the outer edge and an odd pattern across the face. I am trying to contact the seller for a replacement.","4443":"What a cool album, and such a unique sound. The opening song 'covers' caught my attention in a coffee shop. I asked a worker: \"What is this song?\" I was told within a minute, and purchased The Moonlight Butterfly within the day.\n\nThe bass lines are penetrating, prodding, and this forms the BASSis for their sound. The guitar is light, airy and sparse. This does not mean it is easy to play. Making music this good takes talent. These guys have been around for years. Why have I not heard of them before?\n\nHighly recommend.","4444":"This is my third favorite song (after \"Shake\"and \"Pink and Purple\") of the Shook Twins music.  I have listened to all of their songs (some only 30 seconds as they just came out), and this song is really a winner.  Great singing combined with good guitar and banjo as well as a couple other instruments create a positive audio experience.  It's an upper kind of song, so if you are not in the best of moods, this song may uplift you to a better place.  Anyway, it works for me.","4445":"Music is fine, but the \"cut\" includes applause and beginning of the next song for a second or so...........","4446":"this is suppose to be a new updated\/ new versions of the bands hits...i cant tell much of a difference, if any at all...","4447":"My very favorite version of this song...","4448":"Excellent!","4449":"Very good music!","4450":"Great song, Great artist.","4451":"Great song, Great artist.","4452":"I first heard someone else sing this bhajan and thought it was wonderful.

I am sure its great for massage therapist and yoga instructors to.  Probably great for meditation.  If your looking for relaxing but not over the top this is it. It might even help you fall asleep if you want to use it in that manner. I use other CD's for sleeping though. I love it and hope you do to. Listen to the samples before purchasing. I am not sorry at all that I bought this. It is great on my Kindle!","4456":"I've really enjoyed Todd Walton's other works so I received this in great anticipation and was not disappointed - it's just brilliant. There is a quality to the playing that creates atmosphere, space and peace. The playing is always interesting, surprising, lovely, never repetitive. And Todd has the gift of phrasing so beautifully - it's not just what he plays, it's what he doesn't play too, the space he leaves in the music keeps me drawn in, listening closer, creating a certain intimacy which to me is so special.\n\nI love putting this cd on - it breathes the spirit of the player. Thank you Todd.\n\nThis is highly recommended.","4457":"my favorite tune","4458":"This is a very useful compilation of accompaniments. Mr. Palacios is accomplished and has a lovely clear piano technique. The renderings in different tempi are especially welcome.

I like \"end of the road\" too, if you like this song, check that one out too. Perfect cover song of nines classic.","4462":"I love this version of the song. I heard it on a TV show and had to find out who sang it. I'll be honest; I had never heard of 'Me First and the Gimme Gimmes', but I definately know who they are now.

Those of us that know him ... Know that he can play and perform anything from Garth Brooks to Pink Floyd. (And do it well!) His own 18+ compositions are what defines him as a great songwriter.

I Hope Toby's Big Dog finds him!","4466":"I didn't receive this to my music although I was charged for it. Don't think that I will be buying single songs anymore.","4467":"I was sorely disappointed in this album, it's just a hard rock album that uses the Dragon Age name! Yes, I should have been tipped off by the fact they have cover art different from the game's, I thought maybe it was an \"inspired by\" album, but it is nothing like any of the game's music. heck, in my estimation, even as rock music goes, it was nothing special!","4468":"Awesome - love it!","4469":"I would give this no stars if I could.  This is a long version of Electric Worry.  It is a nice version of the song, but it cuts off during a keyboard solo, so you don't get to hear all of the song.  The iTunes version is the same and also cuts off at the same place.  You can find other versions on the web and convert those to MP3.","4470":"Very catchy tune with several interwoven melodies and a good rhythm. If you like jazzy with a slightly latin flair, then this tune is it. Nice sax part near the beginning.","4471":"You don't have to be a Walking Dead fan to enjoy the rockin' tune by Clutch!

Both Diaz and Bonisolli sing with brio and elan, perfect foils for the divas. Thomas Schippers has the orchestra firmly under his baton, takes his time with the tempi, and produces a reliable yet dynamic underpinning of rhythm and melody for these stellar voices.

So you may as well buy a true analog original pressing if you want true analog sound. Or if you want digital music (not likely if you are buying \"audiophile\" vinyl), save your money and buy the CD instead, it's going to be the same, but always without surface noise.","4499":"I have no idea what this was I just heard.  It's a non stop laugh riot that some one thought this was good enough to make into a CD label.  If it's still free in recommend getting it just for laughs, track four \"echo\" sounds like a cat being sucked into a blender.","4500":"Not even worth the free download, unless you are trying to irritate someone by playing it.

As I listened to the corny and uninspired opening track and marveled at the poor singing and the vapid lyrics, all I could think of was my little cousin, who, at age five, announced his yet-to-be-formed rock band would be called The Beatles. Informed that the name had been spoken for many decades prior, he replied \"yeah, but we can be the OTHER Beatles\". Ultimately, the biggest irony is that my five-year-old cousin had a better chance of living up to his \"borrowed\" band name than this clown ever could.","4507":"This is not Raymond Watts. Please go home and pick a new name- you're not going to pick up any fans this way.","4508":"Hearing this for the first (and, with luck, the last) time was like getting a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, as if someone offered you a gin and tonic and handed you a Sprite.","4509":"Not PIG.

It would be great if this band did not show up on search results at all.","4510":"I'm another fan of Pig with Raymond Watts and I, like these other people, am sick of hearing this dbag coming up in Pig searches.  I always think its a new album by the real Pig but its this toolbag instead.  He's awful and just as bad as rappers who use the same band name as others.  Get lost fake Pig guy, you are a douche.","4511":"Hi, just another PIG fan here, big enough and bitchy enough to give the hooved finger to this guy till he takes the hint.","4512":"Today I got a notification from Amazon about Pig's new release. Came here to check it out and what a let down, it's just some flake calling himself Pig. This is not Raymond Watts' and sounds nothing like his work. So whomever this guy is, I've given him one ugly solitary star for using an established name to lure others to buy before listening.","4513":"Great detail. Beautiful tone. I don't usually play pieces like this one, I do more romantic, contemporary classical pieces. I learned le tombeau via a request made by a friend who had just done an anniversary concert for Debussy. I am so happy I have this piece in my repertoire now, it was a challenge but well worth the effort.","4514":"Ernest Reyer (1823-1909) is most famous for his operas, in particular the Wagner-inspired Sigurd, which has received a couple of recordings  the later opera Salammbo has been performed since Reyers death, too, but I am not aware of any complete recording. Well, Le Slam, a symphonie orientale in five tableaux for soloists, choir and orchestra, is an earlier work, having been completed in 1850, and there isn't much Wagner on display here. Instead, it is a splendid example of the orientalism popular in France (and elsewhere) at the time; those things wouldnt fly well these days, of course, but I bet there are more people than me who (secretly or not) enjoys the lush, magical atmospheres of many of these orientalist works. The clearest parallel in Reyers case is of course Felicien Davids contemporaneous Le Dsert, which it resembles in style and atmosphere, even though Reyer claimed not to have heard Davids work when he composed his own.\n\nThe symphony (or whatever you choose to call it) is in any case a very enjoyable affair, with pilgrims, djinns, sorcerers, shepherds and soldiers getting their turns, and much beautiful, magical scenery paintings. Overall, however, the work is surprisingly restrained  the music is tuneful, but generally gently rocking and slowly building atmosphere; even the orchestration is generally transparent and only rarely veering toward bombast or clutter. I suppose that the material is ultimately not deeply memorable (no Lakm, this), but it is certainly enjoyable and appealing as long as it lasts.\n\nLe Slam comes coupled with expected and, in this context, completely uninteresting excerpts from Bizet (Pecheurs) and Richard Strauss (Salome). Being thoroughly familiar with both operas, I don't think I have ever bothered to even listen to the excerpts here, and I doubt many interested in this release would care either. Reyers work lasts for approximately 50 minutes and the disc is still worth its price, however. As for the performances, I suppose on could imagine somewhat more polished ones. The Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Guido Maria Guida plays well, and the soloists and chorus are generally good, but lacks that last ounce of polish and finesse to always fully transport the listener to the magical realm Reyer is trying to conjure up for us (this is pure escapist music, after all), but I suppose that is also to some extent Reyers own fault. The recorded sound is a bit recessed; it is also a live recording , so you get the occasional cough and shuffle. Still, an enjoyable release, well worth checking out.","4515":"How can I review this product when it was ordered a month ago and I have not yet received it yet????

Great energy in these songs. The artist has power and attitude in her vocals, definitely a trained vocalist. The lead guitar is killer and very skilled. The songs have a modern sound with an 80's influence. A search shows that there are two different artists with the name Jennifer Rose. I'd like to find more from this Rock artist.","4524":"if you love the blues, this band should be on your must-listen list. Having recently joined up in 2010 with Christy Rossiter as lead singer, the whole band ROCKS.

This is NOT Bob Seger, so if you're looking for the original artist ... DO NOT purchase this.  It doesn't sound horrible, but it's certainly not Bob Seger.  If I knew how to send this \"virtual music\" back to Amazon, get my money back, and download a REAL Bob Seger Greatest Hits ... I'd do it in a heartbeat.\n\nDON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!

Now I play all of Mr. Oden's songs on random in our car, every day (nearly a year later) because my son loves his \"bop bop bop\" music so much. (His favorite song is either \"The Woodchuck Song\" or \"This Song is Awesome.\")\n\nThank you, Bryant Oden. Your music is wonderful.","4539":"All acoustic. Was expecting some great DSBM, like their other albums. I won't keep this one. Won't even load it on i-tunes.","4540":"This is a series of electronicky renditions of the famous tune, plus one song I have never heard before. Maybe some of this made its way onto the show, but it's not what you want if you were looking for the original title theme. Maybe one of these renditions showed up in later seasons when they started swapping out the original theme...\n\nWhen you listen to this on its own terms, it's all fairly generic electronica. I like a lot of electronic music, but this stuff didn't grab me. In fairness, maybe that's because it violated my expectations. It's not bad stuff, just not what I wanted.","4541":"I love this song but it really is a crummy lady voice.  It is the full version though.\n\nSorry I got it.","4542":"Good song","4543":"PREFER CLEAN VERSION","4544":"Bought this for my son, he really likes it.","4545":"I've played this piece many times and have heard many recordings, but none pleased me until this.

Meiko certainly doesn't disappoint despite her age, and the producer Eleven tunes her to enjoyable levels.

And sounds like it was made on a keyboard.","4550":"Overview:\nOn \"Transatlantic\" Chris Potter switches gears from the small group bands he has been working with and crosses the Atlantic to lead a big band in Denmark.  Chris Potter composed all the songs on the album and conducts the performance by the 18 piece \"DR Big Band\".  Chris Potter also shows off his top of the line sax soloing skills on most of the tunes.  I'm not familiar with the musicians that make up the \"DR Big Band\", but I believe that they are from Denmark.  The music on the album is fairly straight-forward swinging post bop.  It does not get quite as wild as some of Potter's contemporary big band leaders (e.g. Hollenbeck, JD Argue).  However, the songs are quite interesting with many intertwining parts.  Potter, who in my opinion is one of top soloists today, has many blistering solos throughout.  This is one of Potter's best recordings to date.  The big band is the perfect backdrop for his fiery solos.\n\nSong Highlights:\nThe Steppes - My guess is this tune is inspired by the Central Asia Steppes region.  It has a worldly tinge and reminds me of some classical pieces written by Russian composers about this part of the world.  There is a nice solo by guitarist \"Per Gade\" on this tune.\n\nRumination - This tune opens with a reflective Monkish statement by Potter and pianist Magnus Hjort.  It quickly segues into an upbeat, funky interlude where the drums and bass remind me a bit of something you might hear in a Super Marios game soundtrack.  Over the top of that backdrop are some nice sweeping horn lines.  About half way through the drums speed up and get frantic and so does Potter's solo.\n\nQuick - This tunes opens up with a staccato brass and drums line.  After a few bars the reeds come in with an intertwining line.  After a few more bars the piano, bass and guitar nicely blend in.  This is a terrific opening to the tune and the album.","4551":"This CD is awesome, every song on it. These players are hot that Chris has on the CD. Without I doubt this is well worth the money.","4552":"The flute playing is okay, but for crying out loud lady PLEASE hire a new arranger to put together your accompaniment!  Being a huge Madonna fan, I know how to play this song backwards & forwards, on the piano, and every single chord exactly and precisely.  Your instrumentalist's chords were ALL sorts of wrong, in more than half the duration of this track.  A total embarassment!  Next time study the original version of the song your'e covering MUCH much more closely, so your end result won't sound so squirmingly bad compared to the way the chords were actually written & performed.  Sorry!","4553":"No lyrics, all instrumental.","4554":"Fraud. Keyboard. 30 seconds long. No lyrics.","4555":"Not the original song,","4556":"I've never had this cd","4557":"This is an absolutely great album! I highly recommend this for any metalhead. Wicked vocals, icy guitar riffing, thundering drums. These guys definitely know how to create that \"evil\" atmosphere we all love. This is a personal favorite of mine. They COULD be the next Immortal.","4558":"Mostly talk. I was at this concert and thought it would include the whole concert and not just a few songs. Very disappointing.","4559":"As a Hendrix fan I bought this because of the famous guest appearances. What a shame the recording is so sloppy and Hendrix's playing too. Jim Morrison staggers onto the stage grabs a mic and slurs profanity and grunts and miscellaneous rubbish for way too long and the other 'featured' guests are just as pointless as Hendrix himself. Not an essential album for any collection. It seems it was released on the backs of the artists therein and a quick money-spinner for the label.","4560":"Takes me Back in da day!","4561":"The product\nNever a review","4562":"This was one album I could have done without.  Whoever dreamed it up must have been in a stupor.  The songs seem to have been chosen to please composer friends rather than make a good album.  Very few of the selections appealed to me although the singing and orchestrations were okay.  Love Jack Jones hate this album.  POOR CHOICE OF MATERIAL.  The Kapp recordings were the best.  Only a few of the early RCA albums appealed to me. Jack`s great recordings were already behind him when he signed on with RCA.

I'm reasonably certain of the recording\/record match, but it's on a best guesstime based on date of recording matching the record release a few weeks\/months later.\n\nAll the tracks on this Lp are electrical recordings (post-March, 1925), excepting acoustic \"Wang Wang Blues\" from Whiteman's earliest sessions in late 1920.\n\nPer the liner notes, the musicians in the sessions include Bix Beiderbecke, the Rhythm Boys (Bing Crosby), Frankie Trumbauer, Jimmy Dorsey, Red Nichols, Bunny Berigan, Eddy Lang, and Jack Teagarden.  Mildred Bailey does vocals on \"Rockin' Chair\" and \"Stop the Sun Stop the Moon.\"\n\nLp has great liner notes, two full columns.  This Lp concentrates on Whiteman's later 1920s-early '30s jazzier material; \"Mississippi Mud\" is the most jazzy track on the album.  \"Wang Wang Blues\" ain't bad, from Whiteman's early period.\n\nI bought the Lp to get an example of Whiteman's recordings for Victor, after picking up a copy of a Potato Head Columbia Lp, CL 2820, and being informed by my shellac friend that Whiteman's best known hits were on Victor, not the Columbia cuts.  CD reissues of material this old tends to be legal boots (European expired copyrights) often taken from well-used private collections several (shellac transfer) generations down from the A&R masters, while I'm reasonably certain these two RCA Victor Vintage albums&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Paul-Whiteman-Volume-1-LP-Vintage-Series-1968\/dp\/B00124WUTW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Paul Whiteman Volume 1 LP Vintage Series 1968<\/a>&nbsp;are sourced from the original masters at Whiteman's original recording label when he was at the height of his commercial powers.

I was surprised, while playing these tracks, that I found them more jazz musically satisfying than Glenn Miller's slow romantic recordings (eh, boring would be the word), even accounting for the relatively staid dance beat and rinky-dinky '20s - early '30s arrangements.\n\nWhiteman's recording periods can be broken down as follows:\n\nVictor 1920 to mid-1925 acoustic recordings.\nVictor electrical recordings from mid-1925 (about 78s' series mid-19550 or so)\nColumbia \"Potato Head\" releases from mid-1928 to mid-1931 (Bing Crosby and Bix Beiderbecke at their peak)\nVictor 1931-36.\n\nRecord series for the 1931-36 period break down to the following approximate dates:\nVictor 22998 - June, 1932\nVictor 24089 - August, 1932\nVictor 24365 - September, 1933\nVictor 24455 - November, 1933\nVictor 25151 - November, 1935","4567":"super rarities,my type is getting old. we really need a cd!!!!","4568":"When I opened the case I saw everything was written in Chinese!!  Even the insert with the words to the songs -- Chinese!!  Then, I played the CD.  There are two songs that play twice.  If this isn't a bootleg CD I don't know what is!!  I'm totally disillusioned with Amazon for allowing this to be sold by them.  Oh, and I did not want to give this even one star, but unfortunately I was not able to get to this dialog box without giving it at least one star.  I guess I now know better than to buy CD's from Amazon!!","4569":"I bought this album when I was a poor, starving college student because music was always better than food.  Boy, did I feel ripped off.\n\nWhite Bird-a short, uninspired version of It's A Beautiful Day's greatest hit. It is only 4 minutes long and not that interesting. It is a pointless remake. It was only included so stupid fans like me would buy the album.\n\nHot Summer Day-another It's A Beautiful Day classic. This is a seven minute version, with a really interesting, spacy instrumental in the middle. It reminds of Pink Floyd's Echos. The singing isn't on par with the original version, but the music is more interesting.\n\nSwept Away is a jazz fusion instrumental similar to what Jean Luc Ponty or Michael Urbaniak would do. It is very nice, but not up there with the best of Ponty.\n\nEasy Woman is a lounge act song. It sounds like something Tom Jones would do or like the theme song to the Love Boat.\n\nThis Man is kind of disco a number.\n\nBaby Be Wise is like a combination of Easy Woman and This Man.\n\nSpirit of America sounds like something Kansas would do, with a little Bruce Springsteen and John Wayne thrown in.\n\nThis is really not an album worth getting, but if you do, you will get a nice, spacy Hot Summer Day.\nHal Wagnet, from the first It's A Beautiful Day album, plays bass on some of the tracks.\nThe back up singer is called Dominque DelaCroix. Her real name was Linda. She ended up marrying David LaFlamme, and became the second Linda LaFlamme. She is not to be confused with the first Linda LaFlamme. The first Linda was responsible for writing much of the great music on the first It's a Beautiful Day album. She also sang and played keyboards. She left the group, and David, after the first album.\nAfter the Linda split from David, David was not as successful at writing songs. After the first album, all the best It's A Beautiful Day songs were written by Fred Webb, who replace Linda on keyboards. Patty Santos replaced Linda on vocals, and It's A Beautiful Day recorded four more albums. For some reason, Santos was not on the first album even though she was an original member of the group.  On the last album, Today, David had left the group. Fred Webb and Patty Santos both died later.\n\nIt's A Beautiful Day has constantly been fueding with their original manager over the rights to the group's name and music. For this reason, the It's A Beautiful Day albums were taken off the market and have become very rare.  But, you can now get them and also some wonderful live albums.\n\nDavid and the second Linda stayed together and have been performing since the late seventies. Currently they are performing under the name David and Linda LaFlamme, IABD, formerly known as It's A Beautiful Day. Val Fuentes, the original drummer from It's A Beautiful Day is also in IABD.","4570":"It's just the artist playing on most selections. I have just seen her live in concert and was exciting about hearing more from Grace. But, I was disappointed. She is a young, exceptional artist who needs to get back up musicians to accompany her recordings. I would not recommend this CD at all!","4571":"You can never go wrong with Willcox and ASMF.  They have been a superior team for generations.  Always exacting in their recordings.","4572":"This is still the best performance of Vaughn Williams's Old One hundredth.  I only wish we could reassemble the musicians to make a contemporary recording using today's fine digital equipment.","4573":"This is not one for the Marine Band's best recording. The fidelity is not very good. The mic placement was awful.","4574":"She writes the songs and delivers them in a smoky sultry voice. Wonderful and personable live.\nDecidedly bossa nova infused, Hailing from the Twin Cities, she belongs in the heat of the limelight.","4575":"New songs sound good!!","4576":"I wasn't familiar with Izez Matthews when I bought this CD. Unfortunately there's not a biography included with the insert and I haven't had much luck finding a lot of information otherwise. Her voice is warm, rich and beautiful. She projects complete understanding of the music, the style in which it should be performed, and the power of simplistic interpretation and delivery. My favorite interpreters of Spirituals are by Marion Anderson, Leontyne Price, Shirley Verrett, Florence Quivar and Robert McFerrin, Sr. Inez Matthews is right on their heals.\n\nIt was a real pleasure to listen to the recording with one exception. \"Fix Me Jesus\" has a terrible echo and that must be the fault of the engineers who remastered this recording. Otherwise the sound of the voice is excellent. The piano is a bit distant but that's probably the fault of the original recording.\n\nIn all, outstanding performances of America's best authentic folk music. Call them what you like, negro spirituals, slave songs or African-American concert spirituals, the music  comes right from the gut and that's how it should be performed.","4577":"Love this group. Ww so excited to in a cd with this song. I wish they had more songs available on cd","4578":"Love it.made it my ring tone","4579":"I found this record at a thrift shop not really knowing anything about this artist. I was just excited to find a North Carolina native folk singer\/songwriter. This is a completely forgotten album that really has some great songs on it. The guitar playing style is unique and beautiful at times. The lyrics are simple and he does not take himself too seriously which is refreshing. Have not been able to find out any information about this artist online. If you run across this album , buy it! it is a hidden gem.","4580":"Hate it","4581":"This song is absolutely tear-jerking!

I want this version!","4588":"This album is example of putting all the perfect ingredients together and coming up with a less then spectacular result.\n\nThe material John choose covers some of Peter Allen's best songs and John's voice is pleasant.  What is missing is emotion.  There is absolutely nothing that brings one into the song's stories.  Peter Allen himself was not a terrific singer, but like many songwriters before him, usually has the listener identify with what he wrote.  It feels as if John is trying to be too technically correct and as a result, delivers a nicely gift wrapped box with nothing in side.","4589":"Slow it down.... humans barely have time to catch a breath!","4590":"The tempo is way too fast, and it really is not very usable. Dynamics are virtually non existent.","4591":"Ouch.","4592":"I wasn't able to use this music, as I felt that the tempo was too fast for this particular song, and it lacked dynamics.","4593":"vaya, raza fo christ!  ud. no tienen variedad en tu music.  el unico canto bueno es \"verdades descubiertas\", los demas son algo aburridos, aunque la letra es chilero.  pero da dolor de cabeza escucharlo por mucho tiempo.\n\nud. traten demaciado duro ser como los demas, y la sena q aquel hace con su mano en the cover no tiene nada de bueno","4594":"Outstanding mix of songs.","4595":"This is a beautiful song and quite frankly, I cannot get enough of this enormously talented singer and her work!","4596":"Real good tune","4597":"Old School, \"folky\" blues tune  - guitar playing along the lines of Mississippi John Hurt.  I'd forgotten all about this recording until working on  a tax return for a couple who had just separated....","4598":"\"Monsters From the Id,\" like The Coffin Daggers eponymous debut, takes Neo-Surf to a new level.  Until recently, their albums were only available in MP3, but this one is available again on CD.\n\nPersonnel:  Victor Dominicis aka Viktor Venom (guitar, theremin, echoplex); Eudocia Rodzinak (guitar, piano, organ); Peter Klarnet (bass); David Varriale (drums).\n\nOne of the best tracks is the cover of \"A Shot in the Dark\" from the Blake Edwards film of the same name.  The Coffin Daggers would be a natural for soundtracks for films like \"Pulp Fiction.\"  The songs sometimes start off with a simple riff you've heard before, then take off in a completely different direction.  By the time you're halfway into it, you don't know where it's all going to wind up.  There's a lot of talent here.\n\nIf you download MP3s, download legal MP3s.  Illegal downloads can kill a band like this.  The Coffin Daggers have some videos on YouTube--shoestring productions, but they're interesting.\n\nI hope this band achieves the success it deserves, and \"Monsters From the Id\" isn't the last we hear from them.","4599":"Heard this on WGBH & loved it!","4600":"Nice head bobbin music.","4601":"This seems to be in the wrong category.

Exactly as was expected.","4605":"Well after watching this song sung live in Germany today (6\/17\/2011).....the crowd's reaction pretty much went EXACTLY along with my feelings on this song.  They cut to a girl's face and she was mid yawn.  Ya, this song is terrible....it doesn't even remotely sound like the Incubus we know and love.  Sounds like a Top 40 pop song made so my 55 year old mom could enjoy herself a little smooth listening.  The only difference is this song will NEVER break the Top 100.  I'm a 10+ year Incubus fan that's met the band and been to 5-6 concerts.  This song is a HUGE disappointment.  The rest of the CD is reported to sound very very similar.  After listening to the new Foo Fighters CD today I just had to have it.  Classic music by an amazing band.....I'm not even a huge fan of theirs.  What I do respect is sticking to their roots and producing a sound they knew their fans would enjoy.  Maybe Incubus needs to take a page out of their book.","4606":"It's an ok song but what happened to Incubus ?\nThey're becoming top 40 adult pop or something.\nI hope the remainder of this album is ALOT better as I pre-ordered it based some of on my other Incubus albums.

I'm not super religious, but I like how the song could have a double meaning and could trick people into thinking it's about one thing when it's really about something else.\n\nThis song then brought me to the entire Torches album and I thought it was just brilliant and now I can't get enough of the band and the rest is history.\n\nOther songs to check out by FOP:\n\nPumped Up Kicks\nHelena\nHoudini\nLife on the Nickel","4615":"great song","4616":"Good listening :)","4617":"WHEN THE MUSIC WON'T DOWNLOAD I WONDER WHY I PAID FOR A MUSIC DOWNLOAD.

I'm now in my fifties and it's amazing how many of his routine still applies to current day problems.","4636":"nice","4637":"In the summer of 2011, I took my first trip to Nashville, TN. As a huge country music fan, I had heard of the legendary Bluebird Cafe. Upon arriving early afternoon and settling my things into the hotel room, my traveling companion and I saw a couple of things downtown, had lunch, and then ventured out to the Bluebird Cafe.\n\nThere were 4 songwriters in the round. Among them was a beautiful young lady with a radiance about her that immediately captivated me before I heard her sing. The first song she sang was Ruby Red. Any song that references the classic film The Wizard of Oz is ok in my book. I was hooked instantly. This young artist was Jessica Rae.\n\nUpon her second round, she unleashed a powerhouse song of sorrow, redemption, grace, and hope called 24 Hour Church in Memphis. My companion and I stood there jaws agape at this beautiful song. We were fortunate enough to hear several other songs from this artist and when it was over, we purchased both CDs that she had available.\n\nThis CD is raw, poignant, real, stirring, playful, and is still frequently played here. There isn't a single bad track on the album. From the first song (24 Hour Church) to the closing track, this album took this listener on a journey through both the simplicities and complications that life has to offer. Jessica Rae has a way of coining a lyric and then vocally delivering a song in a way that is reminiscent of  Rodney Crowell, Emmylou Harris, Rosanne Cash, and Buddy Miller.\n\nJessica Rae is no ingenue. She is a seasoned and superbly talented artist who could easily stand equal among more seasoned veterans. This CD should be a part of any collection belonging to fans of country music as well as fans of singer\/songwriters. She also blends in hints of rock and roll, folk, and gospel and pulls off each track with soaring confidence and immeasurable vocal control.\n\nI was fortunate to be part of her Kickstarter campaign for her new release, Freedom Avenue. I received my copy shortly before the first of the year and it instantly became one of my Best of 2013 selections for my own collection. While some of the magic from the self-titled CD seems to be missing, the lyrics are strong and the delivery is impeccable. I enjoy all the songs on Freedom Avenue and it's a good, solid CD. Jessica Rae hits all the marks. I will not be surprised when a national record exec realizes what a superb talent she has and makes her a nationally renowned artist. She clearly has the chops and her music deserves to be heard on a much larger scale.\n\nDo yourself a favor, pick up this CD and Freedom Avenue when it becomes available. I guarantee you will have no regrets.","4638":"Not the \"Clean\" version, as the album title would have you believe. \"B!tch I'm a Star\" is still very much in the song.","4639":"I really like Jason derulo. And I love watching this music video. I think anybody who likes upbeat songs to dance to would love it.","4640":"Listened to the samples and it all seemed good. But of course they are only seconds long. Was excited to received the cd - settled in to listen and was so disappointed with the \"tiny\" sound coming from the Bose sound system. The notes are \"sour\", off and our wind chimes sound better than this. Will be giving this away or selling it on ebay.","4641":"The recording ends abruptly and was incomplete. Some of it was ifficult to understand. I would love to listen to a better and longer version.","4642":"The men of Max Q are some of the best singers in the entire Barbershop world.  They all hail from vocal excellence in The Vocal Majority.  They all have gold medals from their many many appearances in championship quartets and choirs.  WHY THE HELL DID SOME LOSER IDIOT PRODUCER INSIST ON USING AUTO TUNE!  For example, at the end of Steppin\" Out With My Baby, the pathetic pitch correction makes these giants of the harmonic 7th world, sound like mice.  It's flat out sickening.  I just can't listen to this mess, especially when I know that they would have sounded just fine without resorting to the crutches used by the rest of the \"musical\" world. Perhaps it was prophecy when in 2007, they sang \"This time we almost sang our songs in tune.\"  Many of these tracks sound like these simply spoke the words, and let the audio engineers bend them into harmony.\n\nC'mon guys, you can do better.\n\nTwo stars because some of the arrangements are great, too bad we didn't get to hear anyone sing them.","4643":"it is simply amazing what 99 cents will buy these days in the way of amazing music on Amazon!!!  Just fantastic ... over 8 minutes of sheer joy ... if you like classical music and if you don't think you do ... maybe try this ... very relaxing .. and yet stimulating.  This one might have been in one of the Godfather movies .. what do you think?","4644":"Excellent album.\n\nWhat I love about Sky Architect is that they clearly know when to amp up the rocking, and when to chill out.\nThe first song on the album is slower, but serves as mood-setting for the next, and so on.  The climax occurs at \"The Breach,\" which couldn't get better.","4645":"I NEVERED ORDERED THIS ITEM, NEVERED GOT IT I HOPE I WAS CHARGED FOR IT.\n  LYDIA","4646":"A bit misleading--I thought Iwas receiving the entire album on vinyl. Bummer.","4647":"I am an advent listener and supporter of Gospel Rap and Holy Hip Hop and have long been a fan of Fedel.  Now, I thought \"Get Live\" was hot, but on the real, this cd is not hot...it is straight FIRE!!!!! I am already on track 9 of 13 and I have not skipped one track and have enjoyed each one! Each track just seems to flow into the other increasing the intensity.  If you like those hard Southern Bangers, this is truly the cd for you, but more importantly, this is Jesus music and God is being glorified and praised in every track! Godly lyrics, banging beats, flawless flows, great features and nice hooks; what more can you want from in my opinon, a 5 Star album!!!! This cd will be in constant rotation!!! Keep the movement going Fedel!! All I can say now is \"Hale, Hale..Hale, Hale..now Work It Out\" and get this cd!","4648":"Al Harris's song \"The Ballad of Kate Shelley\" is passable as far as old backwoods folk songs go. Harris's singing is very monotone and the songwriting sounds more like he's reciting the text of the story as opposed to singing about a legend, aka. Woody Guthrie's rendition of \"John Henry\"\nScott and Michelle Dalziel's interpretation of the Kate Shelley legend is far superior and more enjoyable to listen to.","4649":"Is not what I expected","4650":"This is my very first Father's Day and I just requested this wonderful song to be played on the local public folk music show. I heard it years ago and it stuck in my head and heart forever, and the connections run so deep for me. In a powerful, warm voice like a timeless sage, John McCutchen recalls his dad, of Pittsburgh steelworker, and lover of the Pirates. I lost my dad in '02 and think about him every day, and he loved the Pirates, Roberto Clemente and Steelers so much, and never moved from the small Western Pa. town where he was born and became a pillar of the community. Thanks John McCutchen for this classic! My little boy is only three months old, but I just filmed him in his little crib with this song playing in the background. He's remember his grandfather and namesake this way, and then his own dad who plans to take him to many more baseball games. God Bless!","4651":"This is mediocre at best and a ripoff of Scooter's track, witch just sounds better overall.","4652":"Starts into the song very fast. No prelude. As soon as cd starts there is no warning. Starts with \" i will not drown in shallow water \"\n  No music.","4653":"It's pretty slow and not very melodic. I should have kept looking. I think they were trying to make it sound like they were using period instruments. It didn't work out so good.","4654":"This album has a lot of really good tracks on it. One Little Christmas Tree is another good one and their version of Run Rudolph Run is really good, too. This album is fun and interesting, not sad and serious like some other Christmas albums.","4655":"Not what I thought I was getting.  Should have read the review before I purchased.  This is not done by Cee  Lo Green and it is not satisfactory.","4656":"Didn't realize this was a Cee Lo \"Tribute\".  It doesn't even sound good.  Listened to ten seconds, and that was about it.  Not even worth the .99 cents I paid.","4657":"its another solid album by Poorsport! Over time, I have heard a lot of different music by many different artists, and I have to say Poorsport is one of the best bands I've ever heard. Their lyrics are clean, and the music will be stuck in your head a lot. (which is a good thing) I would have to say they are pros at writing lyrics, and the music itself.\n\nSo here you are, looking at this album, wondering if you should buy it or not. The answer? YES! This is one of their best albums. If you want to get into Punk music but don't know where to start, you should get this first. End of story.","4658":"I love it","4659":"shes my favorite Italian singer of all time","4660":"The volume is really low and you have to turn laptop volume up fully and the it is still a real low volume. The quality of the recording is very poor. Scratch an distorted all the way through. Definitely do not buy this one. I am looking for a better recording elsewhere. It was only .99 cents us so it wasn't about the wasted dollar. I just didn't  get anything but junk for my money","4661":"batman sega retros songs. slightly edited.","4662":"There are about five really good songs on the total album. Overall, it feels a bit drab & depressed. I'm not sure what the audio artist was going though when writing, but the majority of the songs offer little hope or happiness.\n\nI give it 4-stars, still, because those five tunes are so groovy and easy to dance & daydream to. Plus, I believe taste is subjective at best and those other tunes weren't that bad from a logical perspective, just an emotional one.","4663":"Beethoven's music is in classical period with well defined structures and tempos. The play tries very hard to romanticize the pieces. Too much rubato. Stops are too long and arbitrary.","4664":"Beautifully played, this version is top notch!","4665":"Great track, but doesn't play but the first 1 min 20 seconds on the amazon player for Android through the cloud.\nWish amazon would fix their stuff..","4666":"I choose a five star because a friend turned me on to young jeezy by way of my Amazon's Mp3 player today. Great recommendation (Gangsta Music) it's lyrically exotica.  Jeezy had me bobbing my head, and then gifted it to my badass son Zane.  By the way kindled audio kicks.","4667":"Thought it was a different song","4668":"This version of \"Dust in the Wind\" is even better than Kansas' original version.  The vocals aren't quite as crisp (as is typical of \"live\" versions), but the strings from the symphony more than make up for it.  Give it a listen!","4669":"Great jam.","4670":"The official remaster of Deserter's Songs is AWESOME.  Even if you already own the record the re-mastering job is good enough to warrant a new purchase.  However I wish this was included as bonus tracks and not a full priced release.\n\nThis is the album without vocals.  Not remixed, nor re-balanced.  Just the album minus vocals.  I get the idea of why they would do this, as there are so many beautiful things happening on this record.  But they also did a lot of panning and balancing of the instrumental tracks to fit around the vocals.  With the vocals gone these elements should have been re-balanced to stand on its own as an instrumental release.  As they are charging full price this seems completely reasonable.  It is a shame, as the opportunity to hear all of the amazing orchestrations on songs like \"Opus 40\" and \"Tonite it Shows\" are such a treat.","4671":"I really enjoy David's playing. Reflections of Themes is a much more polished production than his first cd, True Intent. His tone is very nice and his playing is fluid. If you're a fan of instrumental rock guitar in the vein of Satriani you should check out David Stockden. This cd also features Stu Hamm on bass on one track which is killer.","4672":"No one like him. His vocals, his writing, his arrangements, it's all unmistakably Drew. So good to know his health issues have subsided and let him get back to his obvious love of music. Keep it up Drew.","4673":"this is a great song. I especially enjoy it when riding my mountain bike through the trails. It's very motivational.","4674":"I ordered this item specifically for the cover art to add to my collection. It arrived in a plain white paper sleeve. Not what I wanted at all, caveat emptor I guess. It was cheap so I'm not that bothered. But I wish I had the artwork...","4675":"Just get the bassnectar version the others are garbage.","4676":"Did not care for these remixes....","4677":"Repetitive. Too new age to be appropriate for hymns.","4678":"The usual great songwriting from James McMurtry.","4679":"I have vol 1 which is the same as this DVD except with more songs don't know why they call this Vol 2 as there is no new songs and it was the same concert very misleading!!","4680":"Great movie as advertised. The annimation was fantastic and the plot was unique. Everyone loves the music.","4681":"Great album, very similar to Bonobo and\/or Modeselektor in sound, great from start to finish. Very pleased with this purchase.","4682":"Discovered this artist on Pandora and had to buy the album. It's rare that I like every song on a CD, but this one is the exception. Great album I love it","4683":"This is a great album, I thoroughly enjoyed listening to it. Similar to 'Still Life', Kodomo managed to make each song catchy and energetic while maintaining the airy ambiance that makes it so soothing to listen to. It's one of those rare albums that you can listen to when you're falling asleep at night and also when you're trying to wake up in the morning. Great stuff! (:","4684":"More like slipping on a big, fat juicy goober.","4685":"The wings of the great bird, always cooled by the wind up there. The sound of the great bird up there, searching for lonely people to devour. I love this song. It reminds me that tonight there will be less lonely people in the world than there were last night.","4686":"Simply amazing. Reminiscent of French composer, Satie's rhythmic progressive work. IMHO.","4687":"Could help you catch a cold.","4688":"Everyone always say \"I love GLEE but ...\". Well, I now understand why. This recording is so poor that I've already deleted it. I cannot imagine what they must have been thinking with this poorly conceived recording. This sounds like a confusing mess with no stand out melody or hook. I must admit that there have been a few other songs by the members of GLEE that I didn't care for but never to the extent of deleting them.","4689":"I have been meditating and doing self guided meditation for years, and have listened to more than a few meditation\/hypnosis recordings. Many of them are crap, but this one fills the whole toilet full of crap! I say that because Bruce Goldberg has made a career out of billing himself as a hypnotherapist and has become very famous after being promoted on shows like Coast to Coast AM. I have purchased several of his books and found some of the evidence for past lives intriguing, especially when combined with the evidence presented by other reincarnation researchers. He portrays himself as a very credible guy.\n\nWith that impression of him in my mind I decided that I would try one of his hypnosis audios. I went to his website first, and that should have been my first clue that this dude is a charlatan. His website was probably built in the late 90's or early 2000's. His proof videos are poor quality VHS recordings from 90's daytime TV shows of him \"regressing\" people. He's offering tapes and CD's. No digital downloads. Interestingly he provides the script for many of his self hypnosis tapes and I read a few of them. All of them start with a short induction about imagining a white light filling your body. Relaxing the tension in your feet, thighs, back, etc. (standard hypnotic induction) \"Play New Age Music for 2 minutes\" Then more script pronouncing that as he counts from 1 to 5 you will ascend to meet your Superconscious Self. So it's that easy, huh? I decided to give this guy a try, but I wasn't about to fork out $65 for a CD! I found an audio on Amazon for .99 cents.\n\nI chose Overcome Procrastination, because I was honestly too embarrassed to pick one like, Make Contact with Aliens. I sat in my favorite mediation chair, put in my headphones and pressed Play. Immediately the crap began. There was no soft music introduction, no calm voice telling me to sit in a comfortable position, take a few deep breaths, some explanation as to the process of induction....just \"Sit back, relax, imagine a warm feeling moving into your toes and feet..take a deep breath etc. (and before I could even take a deep breath), imagine this warm feeling moving into your ankles etc. (and before I could take a deep breath)..same script about moving this feeling into your thighs, hands, back, etc. This process was rushed, and it was obvious he was just reading from the same script that was on his website. The audio quality is horrible. It sounds like he recorded it by placing a microphone next to the speaker on his TV that was playing a worn out VHS tape. Seriously.\n\nI was so annoyed by the crappy induction by this so-called world renowned hypnotherapist that I wasn't even relaxed as the \"New Age Music\" started playing to get me into a deeper state. The \"music\" sounded like it was from the same VHS tape, only it was louder than the voice audio (so if I had been relaxed it would have jolted me out of it),and I think someone's kid was playing the xylophone with warbled piano music in the background. I'm assuming that this \"music\" was from the early 80's and what once constituted New Age Music (little hint Bruce: Update your stuff). Once that torture ended, there was obvious pasted audio of a different session of Bruce telling me to imagine myself going up in a hot air balloon. As he counted from 1 to 5 I would magically ascend to meet my Higher Self. Why didn't I think of that! Is it really that easy? And BAM! There I was, suddenly in contact with the entire Universe! Not eve close. By now I was pissed that I was wasting my time with this low quality, not relaxing, hypnosis session.\n\nAfter more crappy music Bruce came on and quickly read a script about how I would now finish tasks, etc. I literally heard the pages turn as he was reading! No emotion, no empathy, just quickly reading from a script. All I was thinking was, \"What a great way to make money! Pronounce yourself a hypnotherapist, write a BS script, play some crappy music, tell me that I'm now in the 5th dimension, I'm awesome, all my problems are solved, etc., then count from 1 to 5 and I'm back in my body with all that progress.\"\n\nI never write reviews, and because of this fake I've already wasted too much of my life listening to his recording and writing this review, but this guy should not make one more dime selling his cheap, rehashed, 1980's crap!\n\nDON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY (unless you want to either laugh or be aggravated beyond belief)","4690":"Disappointing version. I can't find the Glee Version I like. 2 guys were singing.","4691":"While most tracks here are slower in tempo than most techno ( a blessing and certainly what diffentiates this from the rest), they seem to my ears a little dull, yet, again miles above the standard.\nWhat irritaes me most in techno is the tropes and everyone sounds the same. Very predictable with fast beats and boring, boring, boring major note or chord progressions.\nNot so much so with Grouch, though he does delve into this stereotype, he doesn't wallow in it.\nThere is the dub (The Orb) and maybe a little jazz( Leftfield ). Yet...\nIt is that heavy,heavy bass riff and anarchic topping, slightly unpredictable tghat makes this a joy.\nTop tracks to me are Octophlange, Monster, and Minimila.\nGrouch has major PO.","4692":"It was easy for me to hear the sincerity behind Brother lg's convictions and love for Christ in this song.","4693":"Just to echo what some others have said here--do not take this album as representative of Fields' other fantastic work.  This album takes his wonderful vocals and craps all over them with house-esque beats and bad production.  Every single one of his other albums is better than this one.","4694":"Lee Fields should stick with the arrangements and instrumentation that he knows.  This album is a poorly executed attempt at updating Mr. Fields sound to something more like modern R&B and it fails miserably.  There's not a single song that is memorable and Mr. Fields' vocals sound terribly out of place.  The lyrics are trite.  The music is a horrible panache of differing styles and even the addition of some real keyboards and wah guitar on the last few songs can't elevate this album out of the morass of crapitude it exists in.\n\nPrior to hearing this album, I would have said that I love Mr. Fields' work; now I have to say that I love most of his work.  This album is terrible and will get absolutely no more listening time from me; once was enough.\n\n(I even removed it from my iTunes immediately after my post-rip listening session.)","4695":"In 1976 Eric Burdon recorded an album of new material with a reformed original Animals line-up.  Legal issues saw the collection shelved for two years so Burdon decided to return to a solo career.  Recruiting an all-star cast of friends and associates including Alex Korner and Zoot Money (who co-wrote the bulk of the album with Burdon), he went into London's Advision Studios, recording 1978's \"Survivor\" with former Animal Chas Chandler handling production chores.  Surrounded by a crew of this caliber and talent, you would have hoped for something inspirational from Burdon.  Didn't happen.  Instead the album showcased Burdon clearly looking for direction - was he a pop star ?  An R&B act ?  A rocker ?  Burdon clearly didn't know which way to turn.  The end result was a mishmash of an album that ended up pleasing nobody.  That was unfortunate since the collection exhibit flashes of true talent; especially when Burdon seemed to relax and let go of the 'tough guy' image he seemed so attached to.  Check out his performances on 'Hook of Holland' and 'P.O. Box 500' ...  fun and way more entertaining than anything else on the album.\n\n- 'Rocky' was a surprisingly decent slice of conventional rock with Burdon finding a key that was both comfortable and attractive.  Picture the kind of stuff bands like Slade and Status Quo were churning out in the mid-1970s and you'll have a feel for this likable number.  rating: *** stars  YouTube has a clip of Burdon lip-synching the song on the German television program PopRock (love the enthusiastic German audience):[...]\n- In contrast, the atmospheric ballad 'Woman of the Ring' was a more typical performance in that it aptly reflected the damage done to Burdon's voice.  Quite a pretty track, the main problem with this one was Burdon's frog croak of a voice.  You were left to wonder if he was actually going to make it through the whole song.  Kicking in at the end of the song, Maggie Bell's shrieky voice didn't help the track.  rating: *** stars\n- Another Burdon-Money composition, 'The Kid' was another likeable mid-tempo rocker that again featured a Burdon talk-sing performance. P.P. Arnold added her shrill backing vocals to the mix and hearing the pair of them trying to out-yell one another was actually kind of fun.  rating: ** stars\n- 'The Tomb of the Unknown Singer' found Burdon trying to do country-blues number...  Pompous and overblown, this one was just plain painful to sit through.  I never thought I'd catch myself saying something like this, but I'd rather hear a Kris Kristofferson LP any day of the week.  rating: * star\n- 'Famous Flames' could have been a decent blues-rocker, but producer Chandler seemingly felt obligated to bury Burdon under waves of shrill female backing singers and an overly busy arrangement.  Oh well, this one was at least listenable.  rating: ** stars\n- Hollywood Woman' was a catchy enough song, but some horrible lyrics and another strangled vocal wiped out whatever momentum was generated.  Taken from the same German television appearance referenced above, YouTube had a performance clip of the song: [...]  rating: ** stars\n- Judging by the lyrics including the classic couplet \"she has a calculator up her red dress ...\" I'm guessing Burdon's affection for Amsterdam didn't have anything to do with the city's museums.  Giving credit where due, this was easily the album's stand out tune.  Burdon actually sounded engaged and as if he were having fun spitting this one out.  rating: **** stars\n- Yeah, Burdon's always enjoyed his reputation as a blues singer, but to my ears his barebones acoustic cover of 'I Was Born To Live the Blues' was simply dull and plodding.  rating: * stars\n- After the last blues number, virtually anything would have sounded good. 'Highway Dealer'' certainly wasn't any great shakes, but luckily the song included a tasty, jazz-tinged lead guitar solo.  rating: ** stars\n- At least to my ears Burdon's always sounded better when he simply relaxed and didn't try too hard.  That was definitively the case on the closer 'P.O. Box 500'.  A rollicking rocker, Burdon sounded like he was having fun on this one and the results were one of the album's best performances.  rating: **** stars\n\n\"Survivor\" track listing\n(side 1)\n1.)

Great album :-)","4698":"well it doesn't sound any good on vinyl. way too distorted.","4699":"This Vaccines was a big album in the eyes of many a few years ago.  Let's listen to it.\n\n\"Wreckin' Bar\" is a nice anthemic punk song.  Well it sure sounds like it's in the punk spirit.  Whether it's technically punk or not I haven't a clue!  It's catchy enough.  \"If You Wanna\" has equally aggressive drumming and a pounding rhythm.  It's really catchy and enjoyable.  \"But if you wanna come back it's alright it's alright, it's alright if you wanna come back!\"  That's actually  not the best part- the verse melody is the thing I mostly like about this tune.  \"Well I don't want to wake up in the morning but I've got to face the day, that's what all the friends I do not like as much as you say!\"\n\n\"A Lack of Understanding\" has an excellent verse melody.  Really familiar too.  The chorus is pretty good \"I've got too much time on my hands, but you don't understand or you won't understand\".  \"Blow It Up\" is fairly forgettable since the vocals get wishy washy, but there's enough melody taking place to make it pretty good.  \"Wetsuit\" opens with hymn-like vocals.  The singer reminds me of the guy from Coldplay here.  The \"ah ah ah\" sounds like the 60's song by Dusty Springfield \"I Only Want to Be With You\".  Pretty decent melody either way.  \"You want to do things differently, you'll do them independently\".  I love the part \"Put a wetsuit on, come on come on, grow you hair out long come on, put a t-shirt on do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong!\"\n\n\"Norgaard\" is fast-paced memorable anthem rock.  \"Her mind's made up she don't want to go steady she's only seventeen so she's probably not ready!\" is a funny line.  \"Post Break-Up Sex\" is another memorable rocker.  \"Leave it 'til the guilt consumes, I found you in the nearest room, all our friends were unaware, most had just passed out downstairs\"  is a good lyric.  This song carries the same rhythm and melody the whole way through but it's a good one.  This band has a lot of talent because not just anyone can write a song like this and make it memorable.  Top notch songwriting puts this song in a higher category than most commercial-sounding bands who write music like this.  \"Post break up sex that helps you forget your ex, what did you expect from post break up sex?\"  VERY clever lyrics!\n\n\"Under Your Thumb\" is pretty decent pop\/rock.  \"I don't mind about taking it slow, I'm perfectly aware of what I'm yet to know, mutually assumed utterly consumed, totally adored, Eleanor!\"  A quieter song but still pretty good.  Love the \"Eleanor\" part in particular.  \"All In White\" opens predictably with the chugging bass similar to so many alternative rock bands nowadays, but these guys... well they know how to make it better than most due to strong vocal melody talents.  The melody starts out quiet but picks up the second time around when the guitars comes in.  Really good song, and the lead singer proves he can sing honest melodies.  The way he carries out certain words contains a lot of feeling.\n\n\"Wolf Pack\" is perhaps the only song I'm not fond of.  It has a fast-moving pace but it feels like it's missing a strong enough melody to really grab me.  \"Family Friend\" is a relaxing tune with a much better melody.  Really good lyrics too. \"You wanna get young but you're just getting older, and you had a fun summer but it's suddenly colder, if you want a bit of love put your head on my shoulder it's cool\"  Also love the line afterwards \"Half baked girl hey I'm hardly surprised, snake eyes disguise everybody's lies, faded nail marks on pale thighs and an awkward secret that someone denies, and now you're trying to get yourself back in, come on in\".\n\nThe hidden track, \"Somebody Else's Child\" is a short piano ballad of sorts.  I like how the piano gallops at times.  Touching moment of the album and drastically different from the faster punk\/pop rock stuff.  This album deserves credit for the tight songwriting and strong lyrics.  It's a 5-star album alright.","4700":"The original disc has 11. Apparently, whomever decided to issue this, took only the first 6 off the album. Not good.","4701":"I am a huge fan of Christian rap.  I listen to guys like Lecrae, Trip. Tedashii, Flame, and more like them.  These guys however seems a little more \"street\".  I can't really describe what I meant by that, but either way this album is great!  If you like Christian rap, I would definitively give these guys a try!","4702":"I was very young when Honey was popular, but I remember my Dad playing this album many times.  The song brought back some good memories of my childhood.","4703":"This CD wouldn't play in my laptop.  It finally played off my PC and I don't know what to tell you.....it's definitely NOT Mac Miller's song Get Up ... Sounds techno.  Eck.....NOT HAPPY","4704":"I bought this MP3 so that I could practice singing along with it so that I can sing this song at church.  I don't know that the quality would be there to play live over a sound system-because I didn't try it.\n\nIt's a great thing to have so that you can see if you are compatible with the range of the song before buying the actual CD for performance use.","4705":"After purchesing and downloading we realized that parts of the song were missing and it was identical the Laura Story's version on the radio. We ended up buying another soundtract at our local Family Christian Bookstore.  The good thing was it cost only .99","4706":"I love Tiger Army and Nick 13 ... thanks for having this so I could hear his gorgeous voice! TAND","4707":"I do not remember getting this song. So don't take my rating too serious. I am just trying to get the item off of my needs to be reviewed list...lol.","4708":"Awesome and Powerful song","4709":"This song is wonderful, uplifting, and powerful.  It is music at its finest.  It might just be my all-time favorite.","4710":"This was my first attempt at ordering music from amazon. It was easier than I thought it would be. I'm satisfied.","4711":"Good","4712":"works","4713":"if you like old time country, she is it.","4714":"ok","4715":"\"Blue Star\" by Seapony has a simple, pretty sound, but something about it just didn't sit entirely right with me.  Maybe I don't like the way the vocals seem to be buried under the music, especially the guitar.  I enjoyed the guitar bit, but I don't like it when the musical instruments in a song overpower the vocals like this.  It feels backwards, inside-out, unsettling, and makes it hard to follow the lyrics.  When I listen to a song, I prefer to know what it's about!  It's not a bad song, however, and I may well hang onto it.  Those who are less lyrically-oriented than I am in their enjoyment of music might actually enjoy it very much.","4716":"This song by Seapony has a slightly blurred female vocal accompanied by a surf-ish solo electric guitar against a fuzzy layer of J&MC-ish electric guitar and bass noise.  As a group, their sound on \"Blue Star\" reminds me of a lighter version of the Breeders.  Anyway, setting aside all of the references for a moment, this tune is good enough to make me want to hear the full album.","4717":"I love this song.","4718":"Sadly, the 4U EP was great pop music.  The track with Flo Rida should have been huge, and the followup, would have been a great follow up.  Sadly, they fell like a thud.  Here, we have CS with a deeper voice, and more of a techno sound.  Not good, not even memorable.  I am thinking Atlantic will drop him before they give give proper backing.  He actually has a stronger voice than the other BOY, but it doesn't matter, if the material is this weak.","4719":"The best version of this song.","4720":"This song, \"Forgive Me John,\" was missing from my Jean Shepard album, so it is nice to be able to buy one or two songs rather than a complete album.","4721":"it's not the original and no one seems to carry it in MP3 format. The singer isn't as good as the original artist so...","4722":"Great song.","4723":"I was never able to download this song. I don't think I'll use amazon.com to purchase music again. I don't know if it was operator error or what, but it won't download to my mp3 player, iPhone or iPad.","4724":"She is unfathomably gorgeous,' and she kept female rap alive when there were no others standing. This woman is amazing and I adore her. This song is awesome. If you like it, check out her New mixtape Diamond's Are Forever.","4725":"Beautiful recording","4726":"Years ago i had broke my copy of this cd and i wanted to listen to the songs again but no matter how much i tried neither youtube or google helped me. This cd is so cute and i love it. Great for kids and for people like me who aren't ashamed to sing along to old kid cds","4727":"I was disappointed.  This record seems to be a \"young\" Ella-- before she developed the smokey undertones and range of expression  that made her so enchanting.  I played this and then some of my others, and it didn't seem to be the same singer! I guess these are \"from whence she came\" and might be of interest to a historian of Ella-lore.  But me-- I just like the music...","4728":"The packaging and description of this product are misleading. The description implies that this album contains both De Meij's Lord of the Rings Symphony AND Mahler Symphony 5. When you look on the back of the CD case, it shows \"Volume 1\" as being the complete De Meij , the Sorcerer's Apprentice (for some reason) and only the first movement of Mahler 5. \"Volume 2\" is where you are supposed to find the rest of the Mahler, however THERE IS ONLY ONE DISC! You don't get \"Volume 2\" when you buy this CD.","4729":"Cheap cd won't work on an ordinary CD player had to use my computer.","4730":"Hypnotic helps u fall asleep to wake up and eat!","4731":"this cd helped me a lot.  I used it with other cds and books, and all of them together, worked for me very well.","4732":"The audio version of this disk didn't download onto my I-Touch so I have yet to be able to listen to it or use it.  So far it's a zero in my book because it didn't download so I pain for nothing.","4733":"Highs in this file sound poor and squeaky.  Other MP3 files are OK so it is a problem with this transfer.","4734":"The 101 Strings have gathered a great instrumental collection that will recall those warm, sunny, and breezy days at the Cape, Key West, or Malibu. It is an interesting collection and one is sure to hear some tune(s) that will jog the memory to some breezy summer rememberance.","4735":"The music is Maggie--the sounds of feeling blue, sad and kinda angry.  Maggie's comments make it all the more personal.","4736":"This is a lovely performance. Fedoseyev maintains a light touch, especially in the Andante and the Scherzo, which results in an almost playful feeling to the work; the somewhat brisker tempos contribute to that, no doubt.\n\nThe orchestra plays well and the sound is quite nice. This is taken from a live performance as there is a little audience noise apparent but nothing objectionable.\n\nRefreshing to hear a performance that ventures something a bit different from the frequently staid and serious approach to Bruckner.","4737":"Purchased 'Don't Look Back (Fug Remix') after hearing it on Pandora and I haven't looked back! Nice vocals with an underlying beat which, to me at least, makes for great listening. Sounds super on a strong system with plenty of volume!","4738":"Great redneck remix","4739":"Oops! Fooled Again! Yes, you probably know the story--you hear an excerpt of an mp3 on amazon.com but the excerpt is the best part of the entire song. Then you trash the song, which is what I did. \"DELETE\".","4740":"The case said Gatlin Brothers but the cd was something else entirely.","4741":"This was not even the Gatlin Brothers. It was some other group singing songs I had never heard. I have ordered a lot of things from Amazon and have been pleased - but this was big-big disappointment!!","4742":"Stumbled on the Tribute to Nujabes from Last.fm and checked out Kondor's tracks. Great style. Catchy, head-nodding loops. Fantastic. I just listened to the album twice in a row at work and it saved me from punching the wall at least 3 times.","4743":"Memories, swinging through the ages of my mind.....Love Jamie Owens Collins and this is her song at her wedding and she permitted us to sing it at our wedding, changing the names of course!","4744":"I first heard the song at the Dollar General store in our little town. It is the radio version of the slightly slower, but still great, original. I recommend it to anyone who likes this type of music.","4745":"This aint no Rappin 4 Tay... don't know what he was thinking.. this is trash.. stay away from this sounds like all the crap out today... go back to your roots bra","4746":"Love rappin 4 tay... but i think he needs to listen to his old albums to remember his own sound.  don't fight the feelin and off parole were some damn good albums.  i don't know what to say about this stuff, other than it being POP.  if you like pop, buy this album.  if you want rap, look elsewhere.","4747":"Great music - thank you for what you do!!","4748":"Duwende did themselves proud on these arrangements of MJ songs.  Any accapella fan will enjoy the sounds this group has chosen to use in both the harmonies and beatbox.  Very nice job!","4749":"worthless in my opinion, I'd like to see the dog it relaxes.\nDogs do not like high pitched sounds and this has more than its share or needs","4750":"I like all the song and love it ,,","4751":"Rigamortis: A Zombie Love Story is a movie musical about a zombie apocalypse yet it's also a love story.  The music is written by Greg Szydlowski & Dave Dewes and is funny, a little zany (\"..flesh & chips and baby's feet...\"), and also touching when it needs to be.  It's mostly rock\/pop style with some good horror stings.  There are some memorable songs in it that are ringing in my head.  I see the movie already won one independent film award and I can see why from some of the music.  If you like funny, zany, and touching music, get the soundtrack.","4752":"the sample made it sound like it was really close to the song created for the trailer but after listening to it after download it was really off same flow of music but the intensity in some parts were much more toned down compared to the original and just was not what I was hoping it to be.","4753":"Another very overlooked song this reminds me of classic TB with kind of  A Twist, great song","4754":"Made a mistake purchasing music by this Arthur Brown - introverted and weird - really sick stuff IMO - there is beautiful music out there - this ain't it - avoid like the plague\n\nIf you want cutting edge music try Thomas Bergersen - Ocean Princess or That's a Wrap","4755":"I have enjoyed this duo so much that I have downloaded more of their music.","4756":"I've studies the Reno Brothers history and this song tells the story from Sim Reno's perspective. Well done! There is more to the story here: legendofthrenobrothers.com","4757":"I'm not a big fan of this album in its entirety, not because there's anything wrong with the performances, but because frequently, the arrangements seem ordinary.  The exception is The Heather On The Hill.  The song itself isn't special; just a straight-up Lerner & Lowe song from the 1947 musical Brigadoon.  What is special is this arrangement, which starts with a pulsing 16 bar intro (8 bars of solo bass, followed by 8 more bars of bass and piano).  Suddenly, the original syrupy love duet becomes a driving jazz instrumental with a pizzicato bass line that keeps an eighth-note pulse running for the full 4:20.  Very danceable.","4758":"Beautiful work from these two musicians whose talent are apparent throughout this album.  I would have loved to seen it released on a Compact Disc, Vinyl or a High-Resolution file format in stead of MP4.","4759":"A super great song from Joe!  I think he has come full circle in his career and is \"satisfied at last\"!","4760":"Blessed and highly favored","4761":"lookin good smers as good!!\nmsg in da house!!\nthis cd will make all your other cd's in the case stinky like a red eye!\nchina town husruh!","4762":"I bought this CD in Marini Music Store in Alhambra Ca.  It was a great find with original western music just like the old movies.  It brought back a lot of memories and was very well done.  I often travel from my home in the Bay Area to Southern California and the music fits so well into the traveling scenery I see on good old Interstate 5.  The music is just great.","4763":"I found this version of \"Hushabye Mountain\" by mistake, and I'm so glad I did. I love Stacey's voice and the simple, yet unique way she sings this classic song. I hope to play it for my baby someday. It's so soothing.","4764":"Love his voice. Can relate to this song. Makes me all teary-eyed. Really wish I can meet him someday. Doesn't live that far from me.","4765":"I saw Danen at a work camp over the summer and had to buy the CD. It is well worth every penny.","4766":"Love this song because I'm a Phenomenal woman.","4767":"If you were at the King Biscuit Blues Fest you will find many of your favorites on this CD. Blues, soul combined with gospel all have the Ruthie touch....you feel right there with her in her expressive style.\nOne of my favorites....shared it with many.","4768":"My favorite female singer from 75 years ago.","4769":"I have loved this singer's voice since I saw her on The Voice. She has a great soulful sound and plenty of grit when she needs it. Definitely a road trip or travel album. Can't wait for a long distance car ride so I can put it on repeat!","4770":"Very solid version of an old \"chestnut\". I listened to a hundred artists and more before picking this groups clean rendition of \"Bluesette\". All players are super: The guitarist has a delicious bell-like tone that I would like to emulate if I knew how. The sax wore \"bop-velvet\" all the way through - very tasty. (Bop-Velvet . . Might be a good new group name). .  Would like to have heard a bit more percussion in the mix, but I am not a drum expert and so will leave that to these pros. Sounds like they actually have something to say, which is not a foregone accomplishment in an often played tune. I downloaded a couple more of their songs after hearing this one.","4771":"I purchased the song but wasn't able to download it.","4772":"I find the sound of this recording flat, unexciting & miked far away.  The sound is not very clear in some places & even boxy & muffled at times.  The tempo is on the slow side.  To my ear it shows hesitation, not depth.  I am very surprised at the praise made be some critics or the public about these performances.  Could this huge difference be the result of live recordings ??  Perhaps those people still hear the sound of actual concert they had attended !!  Here are a few comparisons.  The Heifetz recordings certainly do not justify his performances due to the thin sound.  Otherwise they are wonderful.  The Oistrakh or Pamela Frank have their own personality & worth hearing  from time to time.  But the  performances (of all the 10 sonatas) which I would very highly recommend are by Arthur Grumiaux & Clara Haskil, recorded in 1956-1957  & recently re-issued on Brilliant Classics.  They are superb with excellent attention to detail, great tempos & wonderful sound, as if they were recorded last year.  Deeply compelling & satisfying.","4773":"My fiance from Scotland says it's brilliant! Using it for her ringtone on my new phone, now I never miss her calls...","4774":"This 2009 UK charity CD single benefits the BBC's Children in Need, and features artists like Peter Gabriel, Bryan Ferry (Roxy Music), Bill Wyman (The Rolling Stones), Nick Mason (Pink Floyd), Brian May (Queen), Midge Ure (Ultravox), Sharon Corr (The Coors), and a number of other musicians that you may or may not know of in North America (but have reasonable popularity in the UK). This Beatles cover tune was partially recorded at Abbey Road Studios in England (with other parts,  like Peter Gabriel's bit, done elsewhere). Like most \"all-star charity singles\" the rendition of the tune is not amazing. Of course, its less about the music and more about the cause in this case, and it is certainly a worthy charity. So, while I didn't love the song, I can at least know that the proceeds of my single went to a good cause.","4775":"kocham ten glos,relaksujaca muzyka","4776":"I remember listening to this song around the time I was watching Roy Rogers and Dale Evans on TV in my younger years. Nostalgia at it's best.","4777":"it didn't have the songs i thought it would have","4778":"This version skips at 2:48 in, it was encoded that way. Purchase a different version.","4779":"This is not jazz. It's crap.","4780":"new to me...had to buy after sampling","4781":"The wonderful CD, \"Partendo con il cuore,\" by talented artist Andrea Andrei, is bursting with delightful Pop music. This album contains musical songs that are like a blast from the past as Andrei brings back the Pop musicality of the 1990's. \"Besame (feat. Iva Hajnova),\" has a catchy beat, strong and solid vocals, and bright percussive drums. Another song, \"Malinconia (feat. Pavel Roth),\" has a nice, easy flowing beat that grooves around the smooth and emotive vocals. Andrei takes a great classic song, \"Sognando la California,\" (California Dreaming) and spins his own lovely version of it. This song moves with a vibrant beat as Andrei sings the melodic lyrics with a strong emotional intensity. If you are a fan of Pop music that is reminiscent of the `90's, then you will like the excellent Pop album, \"Partendo con il cuore.\" Diane and the RadioIndy.com Reviewer Team [...]","4782":"The ssouns is no good","4783":"This CD must have been recorded by an amateur from China. There are sudden stops in the middle of a melody, followed by awkward pauses that make you think the CD has stopped. It runs from fast to slow with syncopated beats that are not helpful in massage sessions. Furthermore, Amazon, your charges for returns and shipping are ridiculous, as this is how I ended up with this monstrosity. It is not likely I will be buying from you again.","4784":"This is a \"home-made\" cd","4785":"It was on time and beautiful!","4786":"It's very pretty. Just ok.","4787":"None of them were good at all. would not recommend them to no one.

El precio del Cd es tan alto como $23.00 incluyendo el envio,por lo que yo esperava un Cd Original o si bien avia sido transferido de un Lp esta bien pero que fuera original el Cd. Por sierto si la persona que lo esta vendiendo lee esta review y le gustaria, Yo con mucho gusto se lo regreso para atras regalado solo que pague los gastos de envio,Yo no acostumbro coleccionar piraterias esto deberia ser ilegal. Yo creo que es una verguenza que atravez de una tienda de tan alto prestigio como lo es AMAZON,se esten vendiendo Cd's piratas, pero en fin si ati te gustaria pagar $23.00 o mas incluyendo envio,por un Cd que no es original,adelante este es. Quiero por ultimo agregar que las canciones,o el audio de este Cd no se que calidad tenga porque no lo escuche, al mirar que el Cd es pirata me senti defraudado por AMAZON porque yo tengo mucho tiempo comprando cosas en esta gran Tienda y aunque yo se que quien lo esta vendiendo no es AMAZON si no es que es una persona que no deberia estar asiendo esto,no lo quise escuchar.","4793":"I debated giving it 5 stars because it is sooo terrible.","4794":"i've been to Rappa Nui and remember the enchantment of that island.

That showed when so many people started to compare her to Madonna when she did Born This Way. Unfortunately, I really began to feel she wasn't being making original music to call her own. For her latest song from Born This Way, Fashion Of His Love, she takes that feeling of trying to be like Whitney Houston, by sampling her classic #1 smash I Wanna Dance With Somebody. It didn't feel like it was driven from Lady Gaga, whom claimed Whitney Houston inspired her to make Born This Way at the Grammys earlier this year. Sadly, it felt like Gaga really lost her mojo. I think she should try and make more original songs, than copycats feeling like they've less taste than she does. I will definitely pass up Gaga's Fashion, because it wasn't worth his or Whitney's love to deliver with.\n\nSong: D 1\/2-","4798":"There is no question that Lady Gaga has shown to be more like a throwback in her music, by showing that she has been a Madonna knockoff with her music with and style. It is unfortunate that she didn't deliver it. For her latest single, Fashion Of His Love, the single from the extended version of Born This Way, takes a page from Whitney Houston's classic I Wanna Dance With Somebody in the tone. Gaga claimed that Whitney Houston inspired her song Born This Way at the Grammys earlier this year, but yet when anyone tries to sample a great song, it feels more like it is the pits sampled, especially when anyone tries to do a Whitney song. I think Gaga needs to find more original music to call her own, not take on someone who showed she wanted to dance with somebody.\n\nSong: D","4799":"ready to see her live","4800":"ross meek and wale killed this song plus crazy hook","4801":"Love it!","4802":"Unbelievably...BAD!!!

Playel's output is no exception. Relentless, soulless patterns repeated over and over again, with no particular emotional meaning leave you screaming of boredom and frustration. I must give the credit to  Mr. Gallois for trying to infuse this absolutely terrible music with some soul, and bearable moments.  Thank you for trying. By no means these recordings will bring anything new to neither educational nor scholar fields. The only thing they might achieve is to steer people away.","4806":"not sure why this song is so enjoyable to listen to, but Mindless Self Indulgence have really found the \"X\" factor in this song.

Good work","4808":"Excellent Top shelf music !!!!!!","4809":"After viewing the tv show I decided to purchase a few of her songs.  Let's just say, I was verry pleased with the purchase.","4810":"The extensive NAXOS series on Sousa marches on with this current entry.  The interesting difference here is a new band.  No longer do we have Keith Brion leading the Royal Artillery Band of the UK.  Instead we have the Royal Norwegian Navy Band.  Why the change?  I suspect it has something to do with the new idiotic policies of the Ministry of Defense (The MoD) in London.  These bureaucrats, who seem intent on destroying what remains of British military music have instituted new rules restricting how their bands can record and perform on oversees tours.  The result is that we are likely to see fewer CDs in the immediate future of British military bands.\n\nThat said the Royal Norwegian Navy band certainly does a good enough job here.  The band while less known in the recording circuit performs well despite its slight numbers.  The recording quality of this series has improved steadily over the years.  Earlier on there was a thin, tinny sound to these recordings which has been corrected in recent editions.\n\nThe great thing about a series like this which mixes Sousa's marches along with his other music is that you get a complete band concert out of it.  There are enough marches on each CD to satisfy the march connesseur like myself, along with lesser known works by Sousa.  These numerous novelty items, Overtures and selections from his Opperettas show just how talented and varied Sousa was as a composer.  He could really do it all.  As such he stands as perhaps one of America's greatest composers in terms of quality and output.  Sadly much of this music is forgotten today as it was very much of its time.\n\nThere are a plethora of CDs out there playing the same 10 or 15 greatest march hits of Sousa over and over again.  The beauty of this series is that it promises to eventually cover all or most of his music, including the lesser known works and marches.  Each CD manages to have several well known marches on it.  Here we have \"From Maine to Oregon\"  and the ever popular \"US Field Artillery March\"  featuring the famous \"Caisson Song\"  which has morphed its way into becoming the generic US Army song.  Funny how the US Army has no desire to have a march for each element, and prefers to just lump it all in with this single tune.  This is one of the things that makes the US Army a bland entity in my humble opinion.  Having a march for each part of the army, i.e.  Infantry, Armour, Artillery, etc.  might create a greater espirit-de-corps but I guess we forgot about that some where along the way.\n\nAnyway, I digress here.  The overture \"Dwellers of the Western World\"  is one of Sousa's larger works and deserves mention.  Modern day listeners might find the music for the Red Man and the Black Man to be a bit stereo-typed, but this was how they were seen in Sousa's time.  We should not pass judgement on it.\n\nThis is a great series that NAXOS has embarked on over the years and the new band, while perhaps lesser known than its predessor does a fine job under the capable baton of Keith Brion.","4811":"Reno Moisio used to be my parents' neighbor -- he recently passed away.  He had a beautiful voice -- I had to have this album as a keepsake!","4812":"Loved it","4813":"It's a great CD, especially if you're a fan.

As I installed this album into iTunes I was appalled that many (at least half or more) are not credited and are titled \"various artists\". I already know that this album is comprised of various artists, I'd like to know who made each individual song I just purchased. I'm guessing this is the only compilation album in the world that doesn't credit the artists songs.

But, if you turn it up so he can hear the quiet songs, the loud ones (like the first one on this compilation) are too loud.\n\nCompare the first and second songs...way too much difference.","4832":"He's got the grungy cigar smokin blues voice.

Easy way to familiarize yourself with Mozart's work without spending a bundle, and once you've found the pieces you like especially well, you can then invest in the higher priced recordings dedicated specifically to the works you enjoy most.","4840":"Very confused by the description.  I thought I was getting several songs, but there was a little over a minute of music and only one of the Improvisations and I'm not sure which one.  Granted the $1.29 price tag was very low, but this item needs a better description.","4841":"that sucked","4842":"All the re-issues and recompilations of the original Penguin Cafe Orchestra have been altered, or rather bastardized, by Arthur Jeffres, son of the originl composer Simon Jeffre.  Simon's songs were unique and seemed to come out of a completely unknown place when they emerged in the 1970s. Horridly, after Simon died young from a brain tumor, his son took over the copyright, which meant that the entire orchestra could no longer play under the original name. They called themselves the Anteater's for a while - before the Internet there was no way to save the band. Then they grew old and most gave up music. The orginal CD's from forty years ago are a revelation. The phenomenal but understated dynamics of the original are altered and lost now that the son and his band have recorded weak, bland rewrites of Simon Jeffres compositions under the same song titles - selling commercially and to a supposedly brass-eared younger crowd. Some of us have the original CD's and LPs. Nothing like this bland, somnolent, idiocy. What a foolish turn of events. I urge you to quest after the original recordings and compositions.","4843":"I wish they would sell this artist's music in the U.S. online.  That would rock!  Could only get one song here, but it was awesome!","4844":"1994 Metal Reign Music\nTrack Listing:\n1. If You Find It\n2. Working The Room\n3. Damned If I Do\n4. Soul WIthout A Name\n5.

Even if you usually don't go for more modern sounding rock songs like you find on most indie labels these days, you might like this one.  I first heard this as the soundtrack to an MMD music video on Youtube.  Fell in love with the song right away.  Makes good use of Miku's \"voice\" from the Vocaloid software.  While the beat is not exactly the most \"dance-able\", it does sound addictive.  I put this on my MP3 player and love to put this song on repeat while lounging outside in the shade on a sunny & breezy late afternoon.  Good music to relax and kill stress with.  Or even chill in the backseat of a car while your friend cruises along the shore on a late afternoon.","4846":"There are no doubt better pop songs done by Luka, but this one isn't too bad.  I'm not the best at categorizing different styles of pop, but the best way I can describe it is that its style and tone is most closely like that of \"High End City\" by Rin Kagamine (google it or look it up on Youtube).  It has a fun and upbeat sound, so if that's what you're in the mood for you can give this one a try.","4847":"Slappin this since it came iut YAY AREAAAAAAAAAAAA SLAPPET RITE HERE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU IN THE WHIP WIT THE BASS","4848":"Great!","4849":"Thought it was a DVD of the tour, NOT!! Cd good but momma not happy!\nPaid way too much for a o.k. Cd.","4850":"was expecting the DVD to be of the actually tour live on stage....the container was cracked on arrival...thank goodness the cd was OK...my daughter already had the CD... I purchased it thinking I was getting the DVD she wanted","4851":"This was not the song I wanted - I was however given a refund","4852":"beautifully rendered performance.","4853":"It's bland. This is not dubstep. This is the kind of electronic music you listen to when you're relaxing on a lawn or beach or something, definitely not made for excitement.","4854":"im sorry to say but this wasn't really a dubstep, just more of a remix, there where no bass drops, i was very upset by it","4855":"I don't fully understand the market for old vinyl. I buy certain records because I want a particular performance that is not available on any other medium - I then transcribe it to digital and the disk goes back in the cupboard. I also believe that some people see the vinyl object itself as a collectable (like an old book or pocket watch)  because of its historical significance even though a better remastered version of the same performance may be available in some other form.\n\nSo why would anyone want to buy this? It is true that this recording has never been remastered or reissued so if you want to listen to what Schulze and the Telemann Society make of this work, then this is the only way you can. It is also true that in 1962 when this was issued, this may have been the first and - for some time - the only recording of the Dettingen in the catalogue.\n\nHowever, to offset these two reasons for buying there is one overwhelming reason why you shouldn't. This is without doubt the worst performance of the work I have ever heard. Instruments are laughably out of tune, the chorus sounds like ther local bowling club trying it for the first time, none of the soloists are up to par with the alto sounding like a toothache-suffering sheep. Recording quality is not terrible but is poorly balanced with undue prominence given to the wind instruments.\n\nThis, of course could all be a good reason to buy the disk. It certainly is a memorable performance albeit for all the wrong reasons.","4856":"They gave me two songbooks, on in English and one in Japanese. Which I thought was pretty neat. The CD was in great quality as well.","4857":"Lame.  Not sure if they were trying to resurrect themselves as Heavy Metal, but NR failed with this one.  Lame.  Screaming-like vocals.  Pitiful lyrics.  Didn't even keep it and it was free.","4858":"Excellent!  Thanx!!","4859":"Did not care for it.","4860":"I thought it was hard to listen to. Just to distorted or vocals to choked out by distortion.","4861":"The song and video rock,, I never heard it before,,until I saw it on facebook the other day,,Gary's flashback friday!!!!!!!!!!!!","4862":"I don't remember this song, so it probably sucks.","4863":"The song itself is great.  They do a version that is different, yet very similar to the original Damn Yankees version.  The extended solo in the middle featuring  a mix of Nugent's \"Stranglehold\" solo is pretty inventive and actually fits nicely.  So, in that sense, the song itself is well worth the download.  But, and this is a BIG but, the downloaded song is only 128kbps.  That's unforgivable!  When paying to download a song, you expect it be 320kbps, or at the very least 256kbps.  When money is involved, the consumer should be given the best quality format available.  But to give it to you at 128kbps is inexcusable.  This is exactly why piracy exists.  When people legitimately pay to download a song only to find they're given low-end quality in return, it only strengthens the illegal forms of distribution.  And that's a shame.","4864":"One of the most epic soundtracks is back! This is the original soundtrack with the helicopter intro.","4865":"If you liked the show when it was on TV and could get a laugh out of life's problems ( sometimes tears too ), then \"Roseanne's opening song will draw you in. Downloaded it and put it on my MP3. Nice change of listening now and then.","4866":"I love this song!...","4867":"This 10 cd set is a great addition to any Jazz Collectors. It has some very rare songs not a ton of rare stuff, but enough to recommend it to anyone who loves Jazz.","4868":"This seemed to be a pirated CD! Songs were scratched, and the song titles and album cover displayed when played on a media player were either wrong or just \"Track 1, 2, etc\" popped up. Amazon, how do you endorse this! Contacted seller for a refund, did not even get a reply! All others, don't buy from this seller! Total rip off! One of the main reasons I purchased, other than the music, was to get the song titles. There went $25 down the drain.","4869":"I earned a almost free download from some purchases I made on Amazon while preparing for my wedding so I decided to download this song. It's catchy and fun and the video is too. I had nothing but problems being a first time Amazon music user. I still do not know where this song is or isn't. I'm not sure if its \"lost\" on my computer or was never successfully downloaded. Personally I think I will stick to i-tunes. I am really glad I spent less than 25 cents to get this song since I am unable to find and listen to it.","4870":"I bought this specifically for Schumann's violin concerto. And because the others had some mixed reviews, I bought this one because it had none! I won't do that again. Mixed is better than none.  Very disappointing. Mr. Blancher plays this concerto extremely timid and laid-back like a meek schoolboy  scared that the neighborhood bully is going to take his lunch money. The work requires audacity, bravado  ,  boldness. I would have given it 1 star, but I never listened to the rest of the numbers. I'm not taking any more chances with this artist. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.","4871":"que malo esta esto! no cabe la menor duda que se cagaron en la original de Alux... Me encanta la cancion original y estaba tratando de encontrarla en MP3 pero no descargaria esta version aunque me pagaran!","4872":"This is not the theme song from the tv show. It is a cover of it and you can definitely tell the difference. If you are looking for the actual song from the tv show, it is not on Amazon.","4873":"I love Ozzy, but surprisingly this is the first of his music that I  have purchased. My boyfriend and I heard it on sirius radio, ozzy's boneyard, and we were both taken aback as neither one of us had heard it before. It is a sweet, sad, hopeful and catchy song. It gets stuck in my head every time I hear it. And it makes me love his music even more.","4874":"The idea and voice are good.

His bass playing was solid and vocals on songs like \"It Makes No Difference\" and \"Across the Great Divide\" were terrific.  However, on most of his post-Band releases, there is a lack of energy that combined with his melancholy vocals just seem too dreary.  However, on this release from the soundboard at the Lone Star in Manhattan, Danko and his \"Band\"-mate Richard Manuel combine with Paul Butterfield to produce a lively, joyous extended set that is a tribute to both former Band members who died far too soon.  Obviously, Richard must have suffered mightily to take his own life and in his last years, Rick Danko, looked weighed down with pathos.  So it is bittersweet to have a recording such as this to remind lovers of Americana-type music that these two were gifted and vital.  Thanks to whoever arranged for the release of this album.  We miss Rick D. and are glad to have these additional performances to warm our home.","4887":"Awesome!","4888":"The Elves is a fabulous walk down a Wild Memory Lane of Psych Rock.

I am new to classical music, but fell in love with Gustav Mahler's compositions.","4893":"Awesome! m(_ _)m","4894":"I love this song, but the music came with several broken places. I could not even listen to it. don't waste your money buying this individual song unless they improve the quality.","4895":"I played it once then it would not play after that -- Please give me $.99 back.  The same thing happened with another one.  Why?","4896":"In the package for \"Just a Mood\" was a recording of \"Kiri Sings Gershwin\".  I have been reimbursed for the money I spent to buy the CD.\n I wish I could get a copy of \"Just a Mood\" the Red Norvo Small Bands.","4897":"Tommy Jarrell was great, but not when this was recorded. it's really poor.","4898":"love it.","4899":"Has more of a funk to it. Love some Buckethead.","4900":"love the single worth every cent i paid for it. i play it over and over again all day. JUST LOVE IT","4901":"This is a good, great song.  I love it.  The ORIGINAL is even better, on the original self titles album: \"Kim Carnes\" (1975 I believe).  She sings it solo.  It is the BEST, on that one album, but this version will do.","4902":"Just download this song and make a new tradition... Its sweet, inspirational and works for multiple children aka school setting, summer birthdays etc... I plan to play it for my little guy while also adding in his cousins names just for fun...\nReally, its perfect! I love it!\nIrene","4903":"Sound Quality was disappointing.. I was expecting a 192kbps quality at the least, when I am paying for it.. But it was only around 64kbps.. Bad quality sound..","4904":"I like the great sounding song, but I wish it would be able for everyone to buy. End other words where is the CD format???????? ,so you can physically have it and add it to your cd, cassette, a track and record collection.","4905":"Shania Twain has never seemed like a person who hangs out with other musicians, and this is a shame. It explains why she would make a bee-line for David Foster the second she was ready to make a \"come back.\" If she were my friend, I would beg her to steer clear of the David Foster machine which seems to have the unfortunate tendency to flatten out every artist under a sickly-sweet blanket of strings and uninspired piano arrangements. Anything that guy touches has \"cheese\" written all over it: predictable, soft-rock friendly, and catering to the same people who run out to buy the latest Josh Grobin record.\n\nShe should reach out to real musicians who write their own music and understand their craft. I would love to see her make a pared-down record that is clean and from the heart, as opposed to something that sounds as if it was churned out of a music vending machine. I know she has worked with Allison Krauss - I wonder how she would have approached this song. The way it sounds right now is pretty awful, in my opinion - it sounds as though it was recorded in an hour.\n\nIt will be a real shame if Shania Twain throws her talent away and leaves her songs in the hands of producers who will ruin her music and engineer her songs to fit a predictable radio format. It will only serve to reinforce the suspicion that she cannot make a record without being under the control of a powerful, male producer who ultimately makes all of the musical decisions for her.","4906":"best song he ever recorded!","4907":"This was supposed to be \"You Can Close Your Eyes.\"  Even though it's not what I ordered, as a song in general, this song sucks.  I wasted my money and can't figure out how to tell Amazon that they misled me into buying this song.","4908":"Wow thank you christian nazi conservatives for wasting my money. Love the fact that i finally find \"neo the one\" by slyder and you have to blast sum prick preaching.  Christianity has once again ruined something in my life. WASTE OF MONEY!!!","4909":"Of course, being recordings from the the 1940s, the quality is not up to twenty-first century standards.  However, what is missing in quality is more than made up in the shear joy of the music.  This album is just plain fun.","4910":"Didn't meet my expectations.","4911":"I love this version. Vocals sound a lot crisper and the slight instrumentalist changes really give this classic more flavor. Great for playing in my truck or at the barn.","4912":"yeah","4913":"Garbage \"live\" version. Of course Amazon doesn't tell you this. Nicely deceptive using a 1970's picture of mister Campbell.","4914":"This track does not play the intro music that is on the original recording. It starts just a few notes before the first verse, and is very hard sing with. The \"vocals\" are virtually nonexistent. This is a terrible soundtrack to a very beautiful and moving praise song.","4915":"Love it love it love it. I wish it were available on CD. It's more poppy, glossy and has piano and it adds great variation to her library. A must download even for CD collectors like myself.","4916":"Emish is a relatively new Celtic rock band. Their music is terrific!\nIf you like Irish music, try this band","4917":"Best quick buy for my MP3!","4918":"Love, love, love this band!  My favorite genre of music.

So compelling.","4935":"i thought it was a funny song so i decided to get i. it was a little confusing to get it into iTunes but i got it","4936":"I sang along with this while I rocked my son to sleep. Now I can go to sleep myself while listening to it.","4937":"Man am I impressed. I love her music.","4938":"Brilliant","4939":"I wish I could give these CDs no stars because they are God awful. I never listened to them as a kid I don't think, but I work with someone else's child (he has special needs) and these are all his mom wants him to listen to, even though he's technically an adult. Ughh it's so annoying. I don't even think he likes them! The CDs have multiple tracks that are the same. No variety! And the kids can't sing. Like, at all. It makes my brain feel like it's going to explode. And I have to deal with this trash for a 6 hours which is how long my shift is. I'm quitting because I can't take listening to the crap anymore (haha that was a little joke but seriously it's annoying). I don't have kids yet, but when I do we are not going to listen to this. Don't buy unless you like highly irritating songs being played over & over.","4940":"Well, they \"updated\" the original version of WeeSing that I loved as a child. If you know the original, you're probably with me on the following commentary. If you are new to Wee Sing you shouldn't comment because you have no sound basis of comparison.\n\nOn this new version you can look forward to:\n\n1. Children singing in every song. EVERY. SINGLE. SONG. And not talented children. No.  These are children obviously plucked from some random mall talent show or failed Disney audition. Half of the little cherubs sound as if they're a special combination of underwater and congested while the other half are just completely tone deaf.\n\n2. A creepy old man. But not just any creepy old man - this creepy old man sings a stunning version of \"What Did Delaware?\" that will become the voice that narrates your nightmares. Let your kid listen to it. I hear kids LOVE creepy\n\n3. New verses to old favorites. You know, because a song that has been around forever probably needed a dumb new verse no one knows.\n\n4. Every single other CD in the WeeSing series has been plagued by these same problems.\n\nIf someone knows where to get the old tapes (preferably NOT in tape form), I'd love to buy them.","4941":"This is so not the same one that I listened to as a kid.","4942":"Only one song on this CD is decent.","4943":"This is one of my favorite songs from \"Bye, Bye Birdie.\" I have used it as my ringtone! If you haven't heard it, give a listen!","4944":"The songs are great ,but  what  you click on to play is not what you will hear. When you want to hear your favorite song you have to wait until it is played.","4945":"I have been discovering Tirso Duarte with this album. After I had listen to the CD for the first time, I made some lookup on Tirso to find out his biography. Indeed, the result is there and it is no coincidence. This Timba is as good as Los Van Van's.

I love it!!","4957":"Great !","4958":"This is a super fun pretense-free record from a band I first discovered on MySpace. When I was listening to this album, I could smell gasoline, and taste whiskey burn in my throat. This is one of those bands that represents what rock music might be today if the hair bands never came along. there are not many true southern rock bands around today. there are pretenders, like Kid Rock. Dixie Hustler are the real deal. They will make you believers in Southern Rock again in the Mold of bands Like Lynyrd Skynyrd , Molly Hatchet, and more recently, The Regulators. If you like Biker Rock, Southern Rock, Whiskey Drinkin' Rock and just fun hard rock music full of energy and electricity, then Check these guys out on Chevy Sister and Homeward bound and tell me I'm wrong!!!!","4959":"The Lsu sports web site (amazon won't let me put the link in) has links to all of the band songs for free.

I thought the two items I purchased were CD's not 78 records, however, and in fairness, when I checked the listings again I saw in fine type \"vynle\". Too much bother to package and send back. Still, I'm very disappointed as I don't have record player and one of the items was a gift for a friend who also does not have a record player. There should be return stickers included in the packaging.","4964":"Rockpile was a rarity: a supergroup that didn't sound or act like one. It was the perfect 1980 band, combining love for and experience in the music of the past three decades ('50s, '60s, '70s) into its own perfect album and tours. Rockpile came into existence when one of the all-time great songwriters, Nick Lowe, joined a great guitarist with a notable history, Dave Edmunds, a great drummer, Terry Williams (soon-to-be of Dire Straits), and a fine guitarist in his own right, Billy Bremner. They got together to have fun, and they split up when the fun was over. Perfect.\n\n'Live at Montreux 1980' is their perfect live album. Tight, hot, wham-bam-ohCharlieonemoretime!-thank-you-ma'am, unbelievably lively. Reports are they got dropped from a tour with stablemate Bad Company because the guys made Paul Rodgers & Co. irrelevant; they left the stage with the audience in their pocket. I'm listening to 'Montreux' as I write this review, and there's no doubt why.\n\nMalcolm Dome wrote the liner notes to 'Montreux' with a similar sentiment to mine. A metalhead ('Kerrang!') liking rockabilly? Huh? Listen to this CD, and you'll hopefully see why.\n\nRockabilly isn't my favorite kind of music, either, but 'Live at Montreux 1980' should be on every rock fan's list of to-do's. Your honey might even thank you for it.","4965":"awesome and on time","4966":"I purchased this song through Amazon digital download a few months ago. I recently discovered they want me to purchase it again to download again. That's wrong..once you purchase a song you  shouldn't be charged to reinstall.","4967":"Gets you up to praise. The singers are excellent and they bring the feeling to your body and soul. Hallelujah","4968":"This was not the same recording that is featured on Amazon.com. It says made famous by J Moss, this is some one else singing. Not the recording with Hezikiah Walker. I was truly disappointed.","4969":"Th emotion in this rendition is immense. Mr. Lanza's singing is always intense, but this one seems even more so.","4970":"I found the CD hard to understand. this CD was not geared for the novice. I think the words should be spoken more slowly as well as broken into syllables for better comprehension.  This CD is geared as a refresher for anyone familiar with Italian and is not for the novice. I thought I would learn to speak conversational Italian for beginners. I could not understand how to pronounce some of the words. I would not recommend this CD for a beginner.","4971":"Wasn't very zen. Not good for my sleep as it has parts that are a bit rapid for a serene heartbeat. I'm disappointed, 'cause I'm still looking for something that fits what I want.","4972":"The music on this CD is just perfect to relax a person. If you have a stress filled day just play this cd and all is good!","4973":"This is NOT the Columbo theme song but rather the theme to one of his episodes, namely \"Murder, Smoke and Shadows\" which is part of the Columbo Mystery Movie Collection - 1989.\n\nAny Columbo fan will tell you that the theme of Columbo of almost EVERY episode is \"This Old Man\". However, the theme song to many Columbo episodes was the Mystery Movie theme by Henry Mancini.","4974":"it's only like 30 seconds long...","4975":"I guess I just don't get this album. I find it completely unlistenable. It doesn't even make good background music. This album originally stopped me from buying other Tangerine Dream albums. Definitely not for me.","4976":"warning:\nDO NOT PLAY THIS ALBUM AS A FRIDAY NIGHT KICK-STARTER!\n\nto say this album is SL-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-W would be an insult to slugs and snails.\n\nto say 'watching paint dry' would be 'more exciting' would be a clich&eacute;.\n\nto write another word would","4977":"couldn't get it downloaded","4978":"As a photographer, I spend long hours working on Photoshop, and this is great for concentration.  These \"99-Whatever\" packages may be a bit too much of a mix in some cases, but they can be edited and anything pre-1800 tends to enable a lot of alpha-brainwave concentration.  They're a great value and way better than listening to fractile programming and constant fund-raising on the local PBS classical station.","4979":"Not what i thought","4980":"I was looking for this song and heard the sample before purchasing. The original song is about 5 minutes long, but this was just a tiny bit of the actual song - 34 seconds. I felt ripped off. They should have mentioned it is only 34 seconds long.","4981":"great song","4982":"This is one of my favorite song, but the audio is not good enough","4983":"Not worth the price: this digital download was free!","4984":"I took a day in March and downloaded about 700 songs and some were bad, some were great, this one is bad, just a guy speaking","4985":"This is my personal favorite of theirs. The band is from Vancouver and features a female lead singer. Heavily influenced by the Queensryche EP.","4986":"This band is brilliant","4987":"I mistakenly thought these were from the Disney movies. Wish there was a way to return :)","4988":"Haunting.  Relaxing.","4989":"Got this to use as my ringtone. Love the theme song of Winnie The Pooh. Just makes me smile.","4990":"One of my favorites from Thieving Birds!  If you like southern style rock, give this a try!","4991":"KRIT is my favorite rapper this year.","4992":"Remember when you first heard Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik? Well that's how I felt listening to this...floored. I heard the hype about BK but damn this was sheer Ear Candy that was a great balance of insight and style. I have really been waiting for a truly epic album to drop and after hearing this and reading about his free mixtape \"Return to 4eva\" I am definitely waiting for his official LP to drop. I swear this dude came straight out of a time warp because these songs take me right back to when southern hip hop was so much more soulful. This was a real treat w\/ guests that compliment the artist perfectly [David Banner, Ludacris, Bun B, Chamillionaire & Etc.]. For that low price [$3.61] you really can't go wrong (Small risk, Big Reward).","4993":"As stated in my review of \"Candlelight and Romance\", this mp3file is part of the original recordings from READER'S DIGEST - MOOD MUSIC FOR LISTENING AND RELAXATION!  Loved it as a teenager, burned out the lps, got another one from Amazon, then saw these files in the \"mp3 music\" folder.  Was overjoyed, as I couldn't transfer the vinyl to cd's.  Glad it finally came out as mpe files - in fact all the lps(11)are mp3files for computer and ipod, ipad lovers!  These files take you back to the swaying palm trees, blue-green ocean and sandy beaches of Hawaii!!!","4994":"Great lyrics! Amazing voice! SO perfect in every way. I can't get enough. I list to it all the time.","4995":"Since the Amazon site does not allow it to stay up there long enough for me to download while i am here in Afghanistan i was not able to get it yet! I have not received ANY of the new things i purchased because the portal has already been closed. This is becoming impossible to purchase these programs for this reason. And i really like the programs. If you can get them to leave the portal open longer than 2 or 3 hrs that would be great.","4996":"do yourself a favor, listen to something else. There is much better music available than this garbage. Give another artist a try.","4997":"As far as video game soundtracks are concerned, L.A. Noire's is one of the best.  The Main Theme from this set is particularly good in how it sets the perfect mood with a soft, jazzy tone composed largely of trumpet, piano, and brush-drums.  The melody is slow and deliberate, just like the pacing of the game, and things pick up slightly later on when the piano does a bit of solo work on its own.\n\nIt may not be the most sophisticated song out there, but it's not supposed to be.  If you want something energetic or complicated, look elsewhere.  But if you're looking for pure atmosphere with a bit of mystery, or just want to mellow out to a relaxing song, then you can't do much better than this one.\n\nEasily worth the small price for the download.","4998":"I didn't realize it was the \"live\" version.  I don't care for live versions, there is always to much talking","4999":"It's not about the music which is fun.  It's the copy made.  Static through out.","5000":"I was expecting the movie sound track.","5001":"Insipid.","5002":"Cant get it out of my head, don't really have any bad points to me. wounder if the rest of his stuff is as good. If you like up bet alternative get this","5003":"This is probably one of the best live performances of these singer\/songwriters!","5004":"If you don't remember her you missed the very best!","5005":"Excellent.","5006":"I love the worship","5007":"I wondered why piracy was so popular, but this album makes you realize music is just not worth paying for anymore.","5008":"In an age of cookie-cutter music - when the pursuit of celebrity has too often overshadowed the perfection of sound, and when recording-studio magic is too frequently found in the technical enhancements of an engineer rather than the musical talents of the performers - The Albrights are different: They're soulful. They're versatile. They're real. Delivering pop-steeped indie rock in the tradition of The Beatles and The White Stripes, The Albrights are a genuine band that stokes your raw emotions, leaving you with that feeling of just having heard your favorite song.","5009":"Great.","5010":"You Were Meant For Me by Rose Murphy should lead anyone to enjoy this sweet lady.\n\nHer recording of \"Pennies From Heaven\" was used on the soundtrack of the otherwise-silent award-winning 2011 film The Artist.","5011":"Received it within a few days of ordering it wonderful packaging brand spanking new never opened price was right and I'm just thrilled to death","5012":"didnt let me download it, rip off. bought it then tried to download onto my phone, and it didn't work.  i will never buy my mp3s from amazon again.","5013":"Here is a wonderful collection of contemporary songs by a talented singer\/songwriter.  Sahffi Lynne is a professional musician, performing artist, international singer\/songwriter, vocalist, private teacher, coach and teaching artist. She spreads her message of Light & Love throughout the world through her heart-grabbing performances, songwriting, teachings and musicianship.\n\nHer album \"Expectations\" shows Sahffi's versatile musicianship and vocals.  One of my favorite tracks on the album is \"Ticktock Islands\" where Ms. Lynne's atmospheric whisperings lead to rising ethereal voices, and then back to the peaceful soft tones of her voice.  It is performed very well and showcases the creativity and skill of this talented artist.","5014":"I thought it was a mix of the original songs, but realized these songs are sung by no-name session singers.  It still works for some songs, but did NOT work for others, like Michael Jackson.\n\nThere are mega-mixes of the original disco songs. (Disco Party Megamix by Hustlers) I highly recommend sticking with those.","5015":"This is the only review I have ever written on Amazon simply due to my feeling of importance when it comes to this band.  If you want to hear some real music and not just a bunch of computerized sounds or you miss what music used to be...listen to Colour Revolt.  These guys would have been compared to Pink Floyd if they would have been 40 years before their present time.  By the way, they are absolutely flawless when watching them live.","5016":"If you can call mumbling singing then you can call the same guitar strokes over and over for 19 songs a melody!\n\nWhat a waste of money.","5017":"Colour Revolt's \"The Cradle\" is easily one of the best albums of the year. Heartfelt songwriting and strong harmonies make this band great. \"The Cradle\" is their latest and most mature album to date. \"Our Names\" is one of the best on the album along with the hard rocking \"8 years,\" defining the bands past and present. Buy it now! You won't be disappointed.","5018":"The Crusaders aka Jazz Crusaders have been a staple of \"new\" fusion at the time.  Larry Carlton lit the fire additionally when playing with them for a time.  A good educational point from that era, shows how playing and music have somewhat degraded into the 21st C.  A great listen anytime you want to be immersed in prodigious playing\/engineering of jazz\/rock\/funk\/fusion instrumental music.","5019":"SAME AS ALL THE REST JUST LET ME KNOW IF I CAN STILL DOWNLOAD AFTER PURCHASING PLEASE I'VE BEEN CRAVIN THESE SONGS.","5020":"my 14 yr old son has discovered how good rock is and this vinal as he calls it cements the fact","5021":"Bad pressing. Skips all over.","5022":"I just recently downloaded a ton of Afterlife -- such beautiful, kind of ambient music...I listen to it when I'm writing or to calm down the toddlers in the car! :) Speck of Gold is another of my favorites!","5023":"This song is from Randy Travis's 25th anniversary album.  All the songs are sung in duet with other great country singers...George Jones, Carrie Underwood, and others.  This is classic...especially with such lines as \"can't fall off the floor\"","5024":"The opening acapella of Dave Gahan's voice adds a mystery only to be lost 22 seconds into the song with a scratching of a record and a beat (along with record static) that belongs more with a rap song than with this song. Don't worry the scratching comes in and out throughout the song, so if you're worried that you might have missed the background vocals of \"No Doubt\" that is re-played somewhere in the middle of the song. If this is your cup of tea, more power to you!","5025":"One of the best albums you'll ever hear.","5026":"J Boog, good stuff. What more can be said about it. Feel good music for the mood. Would recommend it to anyone looking for the island feel,","5027":"I didn't understand the language in any of these songs, but didn't have to.  I heard several cuts from this album on Sky FM's Soundtracks channel and had to purchase the whole album.  The music is emotional, and quite moving even with the cultural\/linguistic barriers..\nThis is NOT for the casual listener.. The music is quite sophisticated and requires the listener to THINK.  I strongly recommend this to anyone who is fond of stirring, complex harmonies.. I've never seen the movie, but if it ever comes my way, I will set aside time from my busy schedule..","5028":"I have been hoping to get this Soundtrack for quite some time now, but have not been able to find it without spending outrageous prices since it wasn't available anywhere.  Now that I was finally able to get it, I can't tell you how pleased I am!  I already own the movie and have enjoyed it for many years, the music is one of the great highlights of the film and I am so pleased to now own a copy of this Soundtrack for myself.  There are some great African \"spiritual\" type songs on here, with my personal favorite being the Southland Concerto.  If you like this movie, if you like African music, if you have a good ear for good music in general, then I highly recommend this movie!","5029":"I don't remember this song, so it probably sucks.","5030":"Straight to the dump bin that's the direction","5031":"Great song","5032":"I don't own the Sims Medieval, but have been playing a Crusader Kings II&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Crusader-Kings-II-Download\/dp\/B006ULENFG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Crusader Kings II [Download<\/a>] quite a bit.

I give this a 1star because I don't think they sound that good together. Miranda Cosgrove is maybe too high pitched and I don't think Miranda Cosgrove has the right voice for this song.","5034":"I am happy with the soundtrack and I had no problem purchasing. I give this a 2 star because I just don't think Victoria and Miranda are a good pair. They are both on different pitches. I want a refund please!!!!:(","5035":"I did not receive this song.  I purchased it for my granddaugher the same day I purchased Elvis and the Beatles songs.","5036":"Hank Jr to the UN please... ASAP...  what a voice!  what a message!  Don't miss the video version of this song on Youtube!","5037":"The recording quality of this song is really bad, not sure how the recording quality of the rest of the album is.","5038":"very nice","5039":"Love it song","5040":"Pandora and Boy and Bear took me to the Woods. What a bad ass driving song!!!!! Oh, don't tell me you've not heard of Boy and Bear!!! Thanks a bunch for this one, Pandora.","5041":"I am lucky to have heard drop it low by kat de luna many times on both Pandora and iheartradio, with the pitbull radio station being where I most recently heard this song.  Drop it low to me symbolizes dancing and having a good time in life. Additionally, drop it low by kat de luna combines salsa, club, and dancehall sounds. Kat De luna is also known for the catchy whine up song  that featured elephant man.","5042":"ok","5043":"I can only review this song, as I have not listened to the rest of the album, but I have to say it kind of grew on me.  The first time I heard it, I thought it was too slow, but now I actually really enjoy it.\n\nIt has a laid back\/calming vibe and I've used it as a cool down song after a spinning class.  Kind of makes me feel, \"Aaaaaaaaah.\"  It reminded me of Radiohead's Talk Show Host.  It has that same vibe.  Great song to chill out to and one to add to your playlist.","5044":"Thought it was Carrie Underwood - misleading not much more to say than that! I'll pay more attention on the next order.","5045":"\"Clutching Stems\" by Ladybug Transistor is a fun romp into pop splendor at 3:21 minutes.  The song is a simple tune that will brighten any one's mood with its simple melody with somewhat ambiguous and poetic lyrics.  The band has been around for some time but their sound is as fresh as ever with this song that resonates with the past as well as with the present.  There is a bit of The The and Belle and Sebastian within the vocals and a synthesis of beat and rhythm of Owl City.  But regardless of one's musical interests, \"Clutching Stems\" is worthy of more than one listen.","5046":"This band lost their drummer shortly before the recording of this song and unfortunately it shows.  This song actually has potential, but replacing a live drummer with a simplistic and droning drum machine beat leaves it a little stale. Too bad, unless the song was written so that you would actually miss their drummer .. in which case they succeed ... but the song suffers as a result and the lilting background violins can not compensate.","5047":"One of my favorite songs by Paramore.","5048":"I don't remember this song, so it probably sucks.","5049":"This \"Listen Up ya Honkey\" song is one big excuse for D.E to be racist. If your a First Degree The DE fan & your white & not ignorant, you won't like him anymore. He is getting desperate for attention, he's falling off, not that he was up on anything anyway. He never has any quality content & he never talks about anything that matters, just random bull$#!% talking about nothing. He finally got fed up with being wack & got careless & did this Honkey song. And at the beginning of the song he tries to justify it not being racist, but if you fall for it, your pretty dumb yourself. Don't buy this album, don't support a washed up, random, wack \"rapper\". He don't deserve to make money off this wack bull$#!%. Super Racist.","5050":"Every Day is a family drama starring Liev Schreiber and Helen Hunt. The film revolves around a family in day to day life and pretty much explores life and everything that comes with it. For the score Jeanine Tesori composes a wonderful small score that has all the right beats but misses being a grand arcing piece. Now you may say that the film is about hitting small moments and such, but any film with a score release that is only 16 minutes clearly isn't letting the score do its job.\n\nWhat we have here are simple little melodies that while good don't do much in terms of crafting emotional depth. The central motif is quite beautiful and provides a wonderful anchoring point. The score is mostly piano, guitar and strings so the melodies are very strong and hit precisely. What the score does well is craft a warm feeling and then pulls it away so you get a sense of longing. Unfortunately due to the short track times and overall short running time the music doesn't have much of an effect. I absolutely love the last track and it's a great finishing point but it wasn't until that last track that I became completely immersed with the emotions that the music was communicating.\n\nThe end result feels like a wonderful vision that wasn't allowed to spread its wings. When films don't let the score flow the way a score should the result is a choppy obstructed emotional arc. It's essentially cutting off the blood flow of the film.","5051":"I DID NOT ORDER THIS!!!","5052":"One of my kids bought this crap music.","5053":"This has been one of my favorite albums since originally released. Fantastic songwriting, fantastic drums. Nice job transferring it for Streaming and MP3.","5054":"I don't know why these guys weren't up there with the best.  Not enough airplay, I guess.","5055":"Great Song","5056":"The album \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Blow-Me-Away-Featuring-Valora-feat-Valora\/dp\/B005G681QS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Blow Me Away - Featuring Valora [feat. Valora<\/a>]\" is the EXACT same song minus the little intro that I don't care for.","5057":"Breaking Benjamin is one of my favorite bands, but this was an utter crap move.  Valora does nothing but detract from an otherwise very good song.  It was obvious she was simply mixed in, not singing with Ben, and her style of singing does not go well with this song.  In fact, this was an unauthorized mix (Ben was NOT responsible for this) and was partially responsible for two of its members being thrown out.","5058":"Bought by accident.  The person that sings this has a karaoke voice.","5059":"I was really disappointed when I listened to this and found that it was definitely not Carrie Underwood, the way the song is listed is very misleading.","5060":"I thought that it was actually the Carrie Underwood version, but it is not. It was not clear in the title that it was not the original version. Dont be fooled.","5061":"A few years ago I heard an amazing rendition of this classic Pretenders song. I wasn't surprised to learn it was the ever talented Carrie Underwood. Then and there I went on a search to add this MP3 to my collection. Heck, I would have even bought a CD to have it. I came across this in a search of Carrie Underwood and purchased it for $1.29...way more than I typically spend. I'll say this; it should have been advertised as \"in the style of Carrie Underwood\" or \"So and so artist singing the Carrie Underwood song\". It's not Carrie, and honestly it's not even close to the style she sang it. Highly disappointing purchase.","5062":"Not bad, but I thought I was downloading the real Carrie Underwood.  I have to look before you leap next time around","5063":"I give this version of oh Caarolina 2 stars...too slow and is not the original I thought it was. Sounds OK, but if you are looking for the original oh carolina by the Folkes brothers this is not it.","5064":"I'm not sure why another reviewer gave this 2 stars.  1 is being generous.  I have downloaded recordings from these albums that have the dark gray background with the apparent tree branches in the lower right side, much to my financial loss.  I thought the sound on sampling was only because of listening through the computer, but after downloading others that sound exactly like this sample, you can't believe how bad the sound is.  I got a used Nonesuch LP of this recording and transferred to CDR - much better, even with some LP surface noise.  I now avoid these dark gray albums with the tree in the lower right foreground like the plague.","5065":"I thought the poor quality of the preview was simply due to heavier compression for samples.  Nope.  The treble and bass are desperately weak, lending the the music a terrible flat dullness.  I thought I heard a compression artifact in the first movement, even though the file reports as a 194 kbps VBR MP3 encoded with LAME 3.97.\n\nEither this is a very old performance remastered (poorly) from tape, or a recent performance with depressingly poor sound engineering.  Or perhaps it was overcompressed at some point and then upsampled to 194 kbps before being made available, though that would make no sense at all.\n\nA pity as I am quite content with the musicality.  Maybe I can play it in the car.","5066":"Listening to this single takes me back to the day I got the 3-song promo cassette of Draconian Times.  What a return to form!  I haven't heard THIS Paradise Lost since that time.  It has the desperate, sad feel to the songs, yet rocks, yet is melodic.  It has a more raw sound that PL hasn't really had since Draconian Times or actually even more like Icon (my personal favorite album by PL).  Excellent work by one of metaldom's most overlooked bands.  I can't wait to hear the rest of this album!","5067":"For the love of God, please keep that girl from ever singing another note. Horrible. My ears...They're burning! Make it stoooooop!","5068":"This song was already amazing! There was no need to ruin it with this womans horrible vocals. Benjamin Burnley's vocals are amazing on their own. The record company seriously screwed him over by letting this single happen. I believe in Ben's abilty to carry a song without the aid of background vocals and I believe that Ben would have never agreed to this \"remix\" by this group Valora. Has anyone seen them or even heard any of their work. The lead singer looks like a pornstar turned wannabe singer. So just don't waste your money on this single,stick to the original it is 100x better!","5069":"I don't know why Breaking Benjamin allowed a perfectly good song to be ruined, but a part of me likes to think that this was done without their knowledge. The piercing cat-in-heat vocals of the female adds nothing to this track... instead, it makes it sound like an abomination, the result of overzealous music producers trying to cash in on the \"hard alt-rock with female lead singers\" genre that has lead to such plagues like Skillet and Evanescence. They are the Creeds and Nickelbacks of the rock genre, bland bands that sound alike with no real distinction other than how much mascara the males in the band wear.\n\nBack to the song. The song was good when released. Made for a soundtrack, and served its purpose well. With the addition of a banshee yelling in the background off-key with no mixing other than volume levels, the song has the same quality one would expect from a child singing into a microphone to his\/her favorite Dora the Explorer song (but at least, it may be considered \"cute\" in that case). In this case, someone spent money to fly the poor, talentless child to a recording studio, sit her down and say, \"hey, here's a song that was popular among a niche group for a few months, give it a go and see if we can't spice things up!\", and then pay to have it released nationwide. It makes as much sense as spending money to have Rebecca Black make songs.\n\nCan one blame the female singer for doing this? Not really. As bad of a singer as she may be, if someone was offered money to sing something, they would take it, even knowing that they may sound like Oscar the Grouch on crystal meth and Red Bull. Perhaps, due to circumstances, one can blame Breaking Benjamin, assuming they hold all the rights to the song. However, blame can be applied to the \"composer\", \"mixer\", and distributor. Note that the first two are in quotation marks to emphasize sarcasm, as the distributor is the only one out of the three that knew how to do their job correctly, whilst the others had the ambition to their jobs right like Bonnie Grape had to lose weight (that is a reference to the book \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\", for those of you who don't know, or rather, the movie, for those who were born in the generation that promotes music like the one this review is about).\n\nDigressing back to the point of the review, if there is any slim chance that the Stop Online Piracy Act can somehow stop abortions like this from ever occurring ever again, then not only do I support it, I will bludgeon those who oppose it, feed them to iguanas, then take the fecal matter that is produced by those iguanas, load them into a rocket, and fire that rocket into the sun.","5070":"Why ruin a good song by allowing a subpar vocalist be \"featured\"? Her voice just doesn't go along with the music. Don't waste your money on this version - go pick up the original. One of the tracks on this album:<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Halo-2-Vol-1\/dp\/B00067RF6E\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Halo 2, Vol. 1<\/a>","5071":"This a \"band\" that is actually one guy who plays all the instruments, Maksim Ryanskiy. To me, this would compare to older Emperor as far as the vocals and the guitar tone. Songs are well written and structured -the production gives this release a \"thinner\" sound due to well, that's what black metal fans usually like! Black metal and death metal are polar opposites in the musical spectrum of metal in that true BM has a thinner, lo-fi sound while (good) death metal has a beefy, heavy and thicker production.  This some good stuff, I very much recommend this album.","5072":"Originally posted on my blog, Hip Hop Is Read (Nov. 8, 2009):\n\nThe fate of the Shaolin Temple was sealed by its leaders' refusal to open its doors to newcomers seeking to join their following. Had it not been for the monks' initial anti-proselytization policy; had they accepted all those who sought entrance, the Temple may never have been destroyed. This important lesson, often recounted by The RZA, is a perfect analogy for the Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture series. Released in 2005, volume one introduced a lineup of indie\/underground emcees whose form and style were so compatible with Wu-Tang that it made for one of the year's most thorough (and thoroughly enjoyable) albums. In 2009, a new chamber of cross-breeding music has been opened, this time introducing a whole new genre\/style to the Wu-Tang sound: Enter the Dubstep.\n\nDubstep originated earlier within the decade in the midst of the UK garage scene. A fusion of house, drum and bass, 2-step, and London's grime, with influence from dub reggae, dubstep is characterized by its dark, uptempo beats. While artists like Lady Sovereign and Dizzee Rascal have expounded definitely-British sounds to the United States' audience, the movement hasn't really caught on across the pond... or has it? This year alone, dubstep has made a significant leap into the consciousness of U.S. music fans, whether they knew it or not. Dubstep producers Chase and Status' smash track \"Eastern Jam\" was adopted and remixed by none other than Snoop Dogg on his promotional single \"Snoop Dogg Millionaire\". Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture Volume 2: Enter the Dubstep seeks to further familiarize this new audience.\n\nWhile volume one of the Indie Culture series brought along a roster of emcees, volume two is production-centric, highlighting the work of over a dozen dubstep producers. To the newfound dubstep listener - I'll admit, I'm one of them - Indie Culture Volume 2's mixes are either hit or miss; thankfully, they're mostly hit. Tracks like Chimpo's remix of the haunting \"Cinema\" by the GZA and his son are eerily intensified by the sinister keys and the dark and sparse soundscapes played throughout. In such instances, the production creates a brand new setting, providing the vocals an alternative meaning to the original; in others, they re-sample original beats, putting an emphasis on dub remixing rather than remaking. The Scuba Scythe remix to \"Street Corners\", for example, retools the great Jean Plum sample from the original, crafting a bubbling, new interpretation that's equally pleasing to the ears.\n\nUnlike the first entry in the Indie Culture series, Enter the Dubstep does not feature any new vocals. The album is a hodgepodge of verses and choruses from previously-released Wu-Tang and Wu-Tang affiliate albums like Raekwon and Icewater's Polluted Water, Lord Jamar's The 5% Album, Wisemen's Wisemen Approaching, GZA's Pro Tools, U-God's Dopium and more (including volume one of the series). While it would have been nice to hear some new lyrics - especially by the main members of the Clan - it works out better this way since this collection is intended to primarily highlight the producers; as such, it's gainful to compare and contrast the originals to the remixes.\n\nIt's worth noting that being a fan of Wu-Tang is not an assurance that you'll enjoy this album. Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture Volume 2: Enter the Dubstep is very much like Linkin Park's Reanimation in this regard. Open-mindedness is a pre-requisite, particularly for the untrained ear of the genre being tackled. Nineteen tracks deep, unless you're a dubstep fan you may find yourself pressing the fast-forward button once every few or so tracks. But like Reanimation, the core content is still intact despite the altered sounds and backdrops. Overall you'll find that there's plenty of common ground to be shared and enjoyed when you Enter the Dubstep.","5073":"Beautiful and simple tune.","5074":"I need more Matt Nathanson. So much more.","5075":"Great","5076":"Move to groove- choreographers delight with some hot, creative collaboration with terrific electonica- many thanks for the ride!  Cheryl Clark  CC","5077":"Don't like it","5078":"ok","5079":"So, take very generous portions of the Pixies' \"Where Is My Mind\", then add some of Status Quo's \"Pictures of Matchstick Men\", then throw some Garbage into it, get Rick Rubin to engineer the drums, and you pretty much get VV's \"The Future Will Destroy You\". The sources under slavish imitation are tasty enough. The end result is certainly not unpleasant, but more than anything, this makes you want to listen to the Pixies and Status Quo and that first Garbage album.","5080":"This is terrible! People should not listen to this stuff because it pollutes our brains. It is not the best and it is not good for us. Our souls blead when we listen to this stuff. But for the artists sake, I would listen to you if you had some positive songs with good lyrics because you have a good voice and a way with music. I did not like this at all, but that is just my opinion.","5081":"Very satisfied","5082":"'Lie to Me' is the 2nd single from Bret Michaels new album \"Custom Built\", very cool track, the song features 2 versions including the radio version and the uncensored version.","5083":"Unfortunately, this is my second 1-star review on Amazon.  So this is an 18 minute \"song\" with a man speaking German over top of a chill out beat.  I \"Shazam'd\" the beat in a restaurant  ( at the time, there was no German).\nSo in essence, the background beat is really nice but the guy speaking German over top of it isn't.","5084":"Bad vinyl rip, stay away!","5085":"Perfect condition.","5086":"Not even close to the original singers. EVERYONE noticed too... Embarrassing...","5087":"Some hard to find songs...Really like the 12 inch version of the Montreal Sound song Music. At Midnight be T-Connection is mighty fine!","5088":"The ONLY song I want here is Peter Brown's \"Crank It Up\".  NO WAY am I buying the entire album for one song!","5089":"Mark Heards Short but prolific life was more than as a great sonwriter and recording artist. He was also a brilliant Thinker and Philosopher. Pairing with the likes of  Producer  Tbone Burnett, many of his tunes were covered by period artists like Randy Stonehill, Leslie (Sam) Phillips, Phil Keaggy, and I believe Amy Grant. Heards writing in Christian Philosophy leaned toward the darker side, never losing grasp of the hope contained in that Truth. He associated with Francis Schaeffer in Switzerland, and would be a hard one to debate on Theology. His best and last offering, \"Dry Bones Dance\", showed his musical versatility as well as humor, we lost a real innovator in the person of Mark Heard.","5090":"I'm pissed because it's not the 9 minute 12 inch mix. Not happy","5091":"not original artist","5092":"This recording is calm enough to play at a funeral (the reason I downloaded it) yet lively enough to capture the lightheartedness and sweetness of the song.","5093":"Great song writing, amazing musicianship and talent. Is it possible to have a modern album of Hank Williams with even parts of Dwight Yoakam? Indeed and it sounds great.","5094":"Grandkids really enjoy the music.","5095":"It's a toe tapper!","5096":"This is not the Skatalites version.  The tune and beat are similar, but this version has an annoying voice over not unlike the guy who tells everyone in the cinema wha's going on  on the screen.","5097":"Great Ragtime tune","5098":"Will always stand the test of time. Take Five is traditional jazz, smooth jazz, always makes me smile, AND feel cool even after all this time. A true gem.","5099":"The lyrics are derogatory.  Don't let your children buy this, it will influence them negatively and will be badly perceived if they repeat the words.","5100":"I bought this on my android app. I love KevJumba and this song, downloaded\/paid for it, my phone ended up resetting. So, I went back to the app to reclaim the songs, and after signing in, couldn't get them back :( Any idea how to help?","5101":"Deep and moving song","5102":"my kind of music....","5103":"This is the Japanese Edition of \"Inside Out\" by Kat DeLuna.\n\nKat went all out with this album. The album is filled with upbeat dance\/pop tracks. It's sad that the album was only released in Belgium, France, & Japan. The Japanese Edition is the only version of this album to include the songs \"Drop It Low\" \"Boom Boom (Tequila)\" & \"Can You Love Me\". Some of my fav tracks are Drop It Low, Boom Boom (Tequila), Party O'Clock & Be There.\n\nTracklist:\n1. Push Push (feat. Akon)\n2. Dancing Tonight (feat. Fo Onassis)\n4. Drop It Low (featuring Fatman Scoop)\n5. Oh Yeah (La La La) (featuring Elephant Man)\n6. Party OClock\n7. One Foot Out of the Door\n8. Be There\n9. Rock the House\n10.

Be There (Ballad Version)","5104":"Another great reggae gospel song love the words and the rhythm!","5105":"Love love love!!!","5106":"Complete garbage! I was excited when I first bought the product. After a month it started skipping then it started working intermittently.  Finally, it stopped working altogether after 3 months of use every other week. I contacted the company directly and they expeditiously sent another wand without a problem. I received my brand new replacement wand about a month ago and it has already stopped working. In addition to it malfunctioning, the flimsy \"neck\" makes a loud noise when you apply pressure and the material of the wand is irritating to the skin. I would not buy this product again and I definitely do not recommend it for purchase.  I have no idea what to buy next.","5107":"At first I was very happy with this product, although it was very loud, but had enough power to make it worth it. The head is a bit large, and the material as very aggravating to my skin so I had to cover it for use. Aside from is the product started acting up within a few weeks. Pressing on the 'flexible' neck caused it to be even louder, and then it started stuttering and could not always reach full power. I've tried to contact their customer service, since the product is supposed to have a one year warranty, however they've never responded. Very disappointed since this is the most expensive toy I've purchased so far and I had high hopes. Will probably try the hitachi next.","5108":"I bought this for my wife because her 3 year old hitachi wand's age was showing. I threw that wand away (even though it was still in great working condition even after so much use) and decided to buy this one. At first it worked fine, she said the speed was comparable to the hitachi, but the neck was so flimsy when she added any pressure the thing would make a terrible loud noise so she avoided doing that. One thing to add though, the wand was just as loud as the hitachi at full speed, so we were a bit both disappointed about that. She used the wand about once a week since we bought it, and for about 10 minute sessions, sometimes less. After the 3rd use the wand start making a horrible burning smell. Some things really can ruin a mood when all you smell is burning metal and plastic. By the 4th and 5th use the fumes were just unbearable, and you could hear the motor inside speeding up and slowing down, speeding up and slowing down. It was like an old broken motor boat. I didn't understand how this month old wand could break so quickly since she hardly used it and we were for the most part gentle with it. Fortunately after my problems with this faulty product, I contacted Amazon and they refunded my money, so I feel bad giving this just 1 star, but after all reviews should be based on the product not customer service, at least not from a non-involved party in this case since it's sold by a 3rd party company and not Amazon. At this point I wish we would have kept the old wand, but with the refund money we're going back to ol' faithful and buying hitachi again!","5109":"I bought my body Wand and got it today. I have had a Hitachi magic wand and loved that and just got rid of my Adam and eve massager and was looking for something that was less noisy and more powerful. This product is less powerful and noisy. Don't get it if your looking for jaw dropping pleasure like form the Hitachi or adam and eve. The thing sounds like it is about to die when you put any sort of pressure on the head part. Never again will I by this product.","5110":"Body Wand is lighter than Hitachi.  Body Wand is louder than advertised.  The massage head is large.  Not what I was looking for at all.","5111":"Cant go wrong with Bloodshot records  esp at that price!","5112":"I was never able to listen to it!  I tried several times and then gave up!","5113":"good songs","5114":"Yes, it's true, ALL CBS Mastersound Half-Speed Mastered LPs are low-resolution16 bit\/ 44.1kHz digitally remastered recordings as detailed in-depth on the insert that comes with the LPs. So you may as well buy a true analog original pressing if you want true analog sound. Or if you want digital music, save your money and buy the CD instead, it's going to be the same... but with no surface noise.","5115":"I didn't mean to order this.  I'm not a real big fan of old time blues.","5116":"I have an acquaintence named Flo, and the title seemed to fit her perfectly . . . I wasn't thrilled, but, since it was free, it was woth the price . . .","5117":"great music","5118":"This CD has some cute tunes that gave me a smile.  I don't know if I recommend it for everyone but for those that like some whimsy in their life, give it a listen and decide for yourself.  Foul Mouthed Flo will appreciate it ;-)","5119":"I don't remember ordering this.","5120":"never got","5121":"Ok","5122":"This song is by an artist I am not familiar with, but I really like this particular song.\nI am not familiar with this record company","5123":"this album is a breath of fresh air. it is perfect, i loved it. i recommend it to anyone who wants a real hip hop album","5124":"This album is crazy nice.  Grimy ... lyrical ... production...socially conscious.\n\nCOME ON!!!\n\nK R S  - ONE\n\nDA BEST!!!!!","5125":"While not as ornately textured as their very best contemporaries, The Ultrasonics' formula of simple electropop melody and catchy beats make for consistent entertainment throughout this debut LP.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone who can count Client, Emmon, Marsheaux, or Parralox on their favorite playlists.","5126":"I.m not sure what this song was.","5127":"Stupid","5128":"this is not a review about the product - this is a review about the service - - - - is that all there is blew me out when i heard it on the radio in 1980; when i saw it was available to buy as a download recently, i was as thrilled now as then. then i was informed i can't buy it because i don't live in the usa. whatever happened to free enterprise?","5129":"I don't remember this song, so it probably sucks.","5130":"So you can get this song for free.  Big Deal!\n\nThis song does not have the style of music that Thievery Corporation in know for.  The 'rapping' is not that good, but I'll give you that the lyrics try to be relevant.\n\nThe laid back vibe is totally missing on this song and does not represent the rest of the album, which is quite good.  Go and listen to some of the other music from this.  Why did they release this??\n\nHeaven Is Going To Burn Your Eyes Out or Holographic Universe are songs that truly represent the sound of this amazing duo.  Go find the earlier albums rather then get this free song.\n\nI just hope that this is not the beggining of the end for them.","5131":"My favorite instrument and one of my favorite tunes. ( I \"collect\" versions of Spain)  What would Miles Davis think!","5132":"Amazing artist with superb technique and interpretive clarity. I appreciate how she performs modern pieces alongside of those associated with the more standard cello repertoire. I am a fan of her music.","5133":"I got a lot of songs off of Amazon that were free and I didn't like any of them, including this song.  I guess it was worth the price.","5134":"It's all personal taste, of course. If you generally like music from Thievery Corp, you will probably love this one.","5135":"This may be one of a handful of reviews I've ever written on here, but I just had to. I'm listening to the album now, and it's very clear, that this is a special band. Still listening, but already shades of LCD Soundsystem, The Cure & David Bowie are coming to mind. Great production and instruments\/sounds in each track. Definitely a rarity in this day to hear albums like this. I'm continuing to be amazed as I type.","5136":"I ordered this track from the album mondo mambo.  this one is crap!!!!!!!","5137":"worst decision of my life when I was young","5138":"If you think artists like Ke$ha or Britney are bad, then prepare yourself for a whole new level of awful. The music is too simple and sounds like it could have been created by a 10 year old with a casio keyboard. The lyrics are trashier than Ke$ha and Rihanna (and that's saying something) and just as direct and simple as the music. I love how reviewers on here genuinely think this is good and treat it like it's a masterpiece or has some musical credibility - let's be honest, it doesn't.","5139":"I would rate this no stars. My sister has all of this monstrosity of a band's albums and their lead singer dahvi is about as pleasant to listen to as a choir of Vuvuzelas looped for a few minutes. That and they have the worst lyricism i have EVER heard combines to make a serious atrocity. This band will NEVER be anything more than a niche band with a niche fanbase.  BTW the lead singer should rename himself Vuvezela.","5140":"Great product. Arrived a few weeks ago now and in perfect condition. Thank you","5141":"I love this song.  I saw the music video and fell in love. It was not at all what I expected as it sounds like an emo boy band.... But as a child of the 90's I have a strange love for teeny bopper pop sounding songs.","5142":"I bought this song on December 1st and I was unable to download it. Even though this is my first time purchasing this song it says I already downloaded it. I can stream it, but I can't listen to streaming music since my internet connection isn't stable enough. That's why I bought it to download so I can listen to it offline! There doesn't seem to be a way to download a song after Amazon Music THINKS  you've already downloaded it. I had to go buy it again on iTunes so I could actually download it and I'm happy with my iTunes purchase. This is a great song that I really enjoy because it's such a happy and upbeat song. I just wish this purchase would have gone more smoothly. I didn't have this problem with any of the other songs I purchased through Amazon, but now that I know this issue can happen I'm going to be more careful in the future.","5143":"the drum sounds like a remo frame drum with very consistent resonance. What I prefer is the organic resonance that comes with a natural skin frame drum.","5144":"Good music","5145":"the beat is not so bad, and she has a great voice, but the lyrics suck. like a 10 year old girl wrote them.","5146":"The twinkling sounds and the gentle volume create a safe atmosphere to enjoy life in! I like simple music that doesn't lose its momentum!","5147":"ok i work hard i know it but at same time you need music to make you work but allso think as you work do i twist the steel hear do i reheat the tang how would this sword sound wistling in the air","5148":"I feel this music to the core of my being.","5149":"Few things in life have left me holding my breath waiting for the next track, word, note, thing to happen like this recording did. I love this artists voice, interpretation and presentation of the music he chose for this release. I recommend this and all his work highly!","5150":"We have Home Church and this great hymn is excellent for us to sing by.  Verses remain in my mind to sing.","5151":"WOW... This song is SOOoooo good!  Make sure to check out the video of this song wtih Josh Garrels.  His vocals are so INCREDIBLE and beautiful.  The lyrics are beautiful, and the music has a little bit of an island feel... beautiful, happy, everything you need to feel joyful and beautiful.\nThis is one of those songs you might not want to stop listening to... it's beautiful and catchy and just takes you away and away.  It's spiritual and\ncatchy and beautiful all at the same time.  Thank you, Josh Garrels for this lovely music.","5152":"I purchased this looking for very specific songs, once I got it, all the songs were not form the album the cover or description stated.","5153":"Best","5154":"I've said before that I don't understand the point in giving away a remix as the Free MP3 of the Day.  I don't know Amon Tobin's \"Surge\" in the first place, so why would I want to hear it remixed?  Such were my thoughts as I waited for this track to download.\n\nThen I actually listened to it, and all rational thought ceased - and I came to a new understanding.  No, I didn't figure out why Amazon would choose to call special attention to a remix of a song most of us have never heard.  What I figured out was why this is called the \"Two Fingers Remix.\"  I believe it's because this is what you would hear in your head if you stuck two fingers into an electrical socket.  Indeed, the sound of this piece can best be described as \"the experience of electrocution in slow motion,\" though \"cats mating in a video arcade, c. 1990\" comes close.\n\nDear readers, I have had days when I was feeling stressed out and not really in the mood to write a review.  I have had days when my sensitive soul was so battered by unfriendly feedback as to tempt me to retreat quietly into a corner to lick my wounds.  But never in all the time I have been reviewing the Free MP3 of the Day have I come this close to skipping a day altogether - because this song had barely started before I found myself painfully eager to turn it off, and I can't in good conscience write a review of a song I haven't listened to all the way through.  I sucked it up and toughed it out - several times in fact - just because I could never live with myself if I didn't warn you what you were getting into if you clicked that oh-so-innocuous \"Download\" button.\n\nHit that button at your own risk.  And don't ever say I never did anything for you.","5155":"Great.","5156":"LOVE it!  GREAT song that you can listen to over & over again. :-)  Seems like a classic that will last a long time, unlike some other pop-y songs that just annoy you after a bit.","5157":"Record skips in places.","5158":"I've listened and I have to agree with the 1-star reviewer.\n\nI too became a music lover in the late '60s and the '70s.\nIt seems to me that music should have musical instruments,\nsuch as a guitar, piano, bass, drum, saxophone, horn, or organ.\n\nNone of which I hear here.\nI don't hear anything that qualifies this as music as I've known it.","5159":"If this annoying collection of electronic noise pollution is considered to be music,\nthen so is my car horn and telephone ringer.","5160":"Absolutely one of the most intense and groovin' tracks I have ever heard.  DO NOT pass this one up....instant classic!!!  Doesn't start getting really good until about two minutes in which makes the sound sample pretty much worthless.","5161":"Her voice is therapeutic.  What a unique voice!  I really like her and hope she continues to expanded her covers.","5162":"Just used the product and was very satisfied, just as advertised. Would recommend this product to others.","5163":"Amazing voice that brought me to tears.","5164":"I love her","5165":"Best Nessun Dorma i ever heard,except Pavoratti","5166":"Listening to this little girl sing Nessum Dorma is stunning to say the least.  I find it hard to fathom how so much voice comes from such a young girl.","5167":"Great song","5168":"I use this song to teach linking in Spanish pronunciation, following the site by Barbara K. Nelson.  Using an Mp3 version can be opened by all users.","5169":"Good mid classical period music.","5170":"I ment to download the original version. The new version isn't so good","5171":"Hated this version. Listen before buying!","5172":"Never thought I'd give a BLUETECH recording a negative review, but this one qualifies. It is pretentious, ponderous, and not as enjoyable as the previous CD's In My Opinion. The female singers are both annoying. Ms. Blackstone tries WAY too hard, forcing those hellacious high notes, and cracking the glass within My head. .The Poetic Female \"Singer\" on two songs is over-elucidating silly lyrics that are snarky in their uselessness. Like a stoned Hippie grabbing for meaningful words, it is painful to listen to. Hope BLUETECH gets back on track. He creates some of the most scintillating Music out there. For Me, not on this CD though.","5173":"Meh, Dolly Parton is better.  This one doesn't have the same ah what's the word I'm looking for...eh...character to it.  Close..but no cigar.  Or shall I say close but no Parton.","5174":"Was looking for harmony with a higher soprano voice harmonizing, but this one had such a beautiful voice blend that I decided on it.","5175":"Ordered Please Forgive Me Performance Tracks by mistake, I thought I was ordering a single by J D Somers band.","5176":"The track was great. I just don't understand why my performance, using this track, can't be streamed without paying them again. They sold it to me so I could sing a performance. Someone must have paid off some judge.","5177":"It should've had cd vinyl with remixes of watching you.","5178":"This track is not useful for a solo artist. Starts high and then goes lower.","5179":"I have to say that the song Sanctuary caught my attention first and then when I heard the music I was instantly hooked. I can't wait to see them in the United States touring.","5180":"awesome","5181":"I love Highland music but this just did not live up to the standards of other CD's.  Would love to return it.","5182":"Scratched... skips a lot!","5183":"I thought I was getting a different song very dissappointed","5184":"What a great CD!\nI bought it for a family member and I listen to it often.  Personally, I do not recognize the hymns b\/c there are no lyrics; the instrumentals are fantastic.  I would have never come across this CD if I hadn't purchased it for someone else b\/c I have never purchased religious genre music.\nThere is such an eclectic selection of worldly instrumentals.  Some songs have become daily favorites, especially for de-stressing, meditating, yoga, or falling asleep.\nAlso, many of these instrumentals are such a treasure to listen to because in some of these countries Christianity is banned and we would never naturally be able to listen to these songs otherwise.\nWe just LOVE THIS CD!","5185":"If you have never heard Matt Mason, PLEASE listen to this song.\nMatt won CMT's Next Superstar competition in 2011 and his career is taking off.\nHe is such a classic country artist and his song writing speaks to my soul.","5186":"Good MP3","5187":"I thought I was ordering a CD not a download --I don't even know how to download music. I don't have a ipod. Thank you","5188":"Didn't like it as much as I thought I would. Wish I had chosen something else. Not my kind of music","5189":"I only need\/want the Nonet by Fisher Tull not the entire album. I am not going to buy the entire album. Please make each track available individually.\n\nThanks","5190":"Perhaps more than any other, this song reminds me of the Scripture, \"It is better to listen to the rebuke of a wise man than for one to listen to the song of fools\" (Ecclesiastes 7:5).","5191":"More classic salsa.","5192":"I love salsa music I am  a new york rican. I love to dance this kind of music. I love tito rojas music I have all his cd and they are very good music. I would recommend this to anyone that likes salsa music to dance to.","5193":"I always like the way Robert sings.  I can feel the wordings of the songs whenever he sings.  Great job.","5194":"This song rocks on all levels more colaberations in the future plz the whole cd kicks ass must have on any I pod","5195":"These smooth traditional jazz tunes really have helped me lure the pigeons in. If you want some great jazz and share a love for pigeons like I do then this album is a must for every jazz\/pigeon connoisseur.","5196":"Asin is a legendary Filipino rock\/country group during the 70s and 80s with songs focused on the message of social transformation and strong love for country and the environment. This song in particular is one of their signature releases and glad that Amazon carries this album.","5197":"This was a great song, I could listen to it all day long. The download was quick and easy .","5198":"mexicans pwn blacks","5199":"She has potential but these songs are just too dull. There is nothing interesting about it. It's pretty much garbage.","5200":"Mal porducido, mal escrito, pero sobre todo mal cantado. El mismo estilo de pop barato que intenta pasar por pop de calidad, la voz es demasiado aguda y a la tercera cancin cansa. Un disco plano, sin concepto, sin sonidos novedosos... Un desperdicio de dinero","5201":"Beautiful song.  My Grand daughter can't go to sleep without it.","5202":"the best thin lizzy album. the songs are very relatable and timeless.","5203":"Heard this damn song on the last episode of Breaking In season 1. F***ing thing was stuck in my head.","5204":"Amazon should be ashamed of itself for allowing this piece of junk onto the net.\n\nShame.....\n\nThe sound quality is terrible... as if it were recorded underwater, over a telephone line.","5205":"Oscar Peterson is by head and shoulders my favorite classic jazz artist. I have a number of his albums on both CD and MP3, and all the others I've listened to sound great. I don't know how you achieve making Oscar Peterson sound bad, but whoever put this album together managed it.\n\nThe high notes are tinny. The bass is distorted and fuzzy. There are cracks and pops as if the source material was damaged vinyl. The price for 85 Peterson tunes sounds too good to be true, and the result fits that cliche. If you don't believe me, just listen to the track samples. The problems are evident in virtually every one of them.\n\nIf you like jazz, by all means listen to Oscar Peterson, but please, please, don't let this be your first experience. Oscar Peterson and his Trio are top flight talent. This album, which presents with all the acoustic quality of your average elementary school cafeteria, would sadly put you off from discovering his incredible talent on properly produced media.","5206":"This is not essential to anyone, unless you are looking for 85 of the most poorly recorded monaural tracks in Oscar Peterson's career. The sound quality is atrocious, and every track that I've listened to so far (it's too painful to listen to more than 3 or 4 tracks at a time) are in mono. The louder dynamics from the piano break up. DO NOT BUY THIS.","5207":"i was disappointed with this because it is not the full song.... just the alapana at the beginning and even that was cut.","5208":"It gives me goose bumps, cause he is say n feeling what I feel n I thank God for his incredable voice.

Would buy again!","5211":"EVERYTHING I HOPED IT WOULD BE. VERY,VERY RELAXING.","5212":"Very soothing music to read\/relax \/nap or fall asleep too.  Great if you have hypertension or insomia I would think also.","5213":"Have used this for meditation and it is very powerful. The words are simple but the meanng is deep and can penetrate the heart if allowed.","5214":"Amazing album","5215":"Relaxing","5216":"The banging and pinging that was added to each of the passages is not only annoying, it won't help any toddler get to sleep or stay asleep.","5217":"Just cheap loops.","5218":"Its really nice and free with membership I think","5219":"this is elevator music not classical music, they have ruined some of the best music written.","5220":"Very calming music.

I have the original album and cd.  I'm so glad its all in one now.  I Love the Wagoneers, their sound is timeless.  Not a bad song on this cd, I would recommend this to anyone who loves the pure sound of country!!","5223":"I thought I was getting the actual CD to give as a Christmas gift.  I can't use the download.","5224":"Not what I wanted, has many songs that are not original, plus the CD's are not a good quality. hope will no happen again.","5225":"It will not operate on my classroom computer - other downloads have but not this one and I do not know how to return it. :C","5226":"Basic dance music, nothing special, good for work in front of a computer.  Worth the 1 dollar I paid for the song.","5227":"This compilation is a strange patchwork of many different styles, that don't really stick together. Is not what the title suggest: neither chillout (around the middle), or workout music (only in the beginning). In general, could better be qualified as relaxation music (although some songs are annoying).","5228":"Repeats, there is traffic noise in the background, looped.","5229":"This is the official 1st live record of this remarkable english band that reigned the Pop\/Rock charts during the 85-90 period, just before Grunge music takes over. The Mirrorball live set list includes a good selection of the band's early catalog with such anthems like Rock  Rock  (till you drop) & Foolin', among other highlights, besides there's 3 new songs (Undefeated, Kings of the world, It's about time) that flow in the Leppard's recenly musical vibe: more cool down because of the members new \"healthy way of life\". The \"more\" of this package is a DVD that chronicles the Sparkle Lounge Tour 2008-2009. A must See & Hear cd\/dvd combo.","5230":"This is the funniest album for Catholics in particular, and religious people in general.\nRon Carey's performance is truly inspired and hilarious to anyone who can see the humor in religion.\nThis humor never gets old and stands the test of time.\nPrepare thee for the laughing!\nAnd go in peace, prospering and seeing the light.","5231":"Great!","5232":"just amazing","5233":"Good sound. Satisfied with the purchase.","5234":"Didn't work","5235":"TThe music is great  by itself but they decided to add in all these sound effects --- ohing - ahhing - of people in the throes of passion. I wanted the music for relaxation and would only care to hear myself and my liover NOT others.....adding a soundtrack is distracting. A tterrible idea.","5236":"OMG I love Skylar Grey I listen to this song at least 20 times a day. She has god given talent unlike the rest of the mainstream hacks that the sheeple listen to.","5237":"Excellent rendition of Led Zeppelin classic. Done a lot heavier, yet close to original.","5238":"Soothing and relaxing variety of music coupled with the ocean.  Very nice if you like the sound of the ocean.","5239":"The given: effective relaxation music tends to be in the ear of the listener. Ordering on Kindle is hit and miss since one has only 30 seconds to listen before the cutoff to buy or pass. Over the years I've spent considerable money on CDs that gave no warning a cacophonous piano riff or other loud sound would erupt and pull me out of drowsy to full on awake. THE SECRET GARDEN is perfect! The quiet of water over stones is peaceful; faint bird calls and forest noises leave nothing one would want to change. I even love the name! :) Buy this one. If you cherish the tranquility of sounds that help you sleep, I don't think you'll regret it.","5240":"didn't cost alot , but wasn't exactly what i expected, if you like sexual noise its perfect for you and yourz","5241":"I'm sorry for the cruddity rude lingo but this album sucks and someone needs to say it straight up. It's just one guy playing one insturment on every track and some tracks are near identical, like a Wal-Mart Tai Chi album. No way; sample the tracks first and you'll see. What we're REALLY looking for is a 'beautiful music' orchestra that sounds like \"1000 Strings\", with or without female vocals. If anyone knows of such an album(s) pleez respond; so will I.","5242":"BORING!  I guess if you wanted to fall asleep this would be a great album.  Also, since I'm a teacher as well as a practitioner, it would be very nice if someone would put music in order...in other words: a slow centering song first, followed by music that goes with your practice and builds in intensity (as this album says \"Power Yoga\"...ha), then lowering the intensity until you add the last song for savasana (a very meditative type of song).\n\nVERY DISAPPOINTED!","5243":"Love Michael Posner...not Michael POSER. Bought this on accident because I was distracted while searching for \"Cooler than me.\" Didn't even notice the missing N.  It's some weird dance-club\/remix song that repeats the same line over and over...would not suggest!","5244":"Too many songs with Lyrics... I was looking for some Instrumental Chill","5245":"Great song to tell those \"one night\" girls how it really is. Just kidding of course, this song is very catchy.","5246":"This album is not really 40 different songs. Its about 5 songs with different names and track length, still good music though","5247":"Sample never would play.\n=o(","5248":"This is NOT the Andre Kostelanetz Orchestra. I have the original version from a vynil Columbia album and I thought this is the original version remastered.\nBut it is NOT !!","5249":"I first heard this LP in the early 1970's and was delighted to find it on compact disc on Amazon.  I was surprised that many of these recordings were from the mid to late 40's and yet the quality of the recordings are crystal clear.  These songs are arranged and scored in such a majestic manner with a large orchestra which does more than provide background music for each arrangement itself sounds like a suite, as it each track was by itself a production number.  All of the great composers of the 20th century, or at least many of them, are featured here and as someone who listens to a great deal of music, I enjoy this album very much and highly recommend it.","5250":"Looking for the radio edit? This is most definitely not it.","5251":"Nice recording, except that it's been created from a short sound effect and the edits, while smooth, change level.  I would prefer a continuous recording.","5252":"I bought this on a whim because I like some minimalist styles in music.  Sorry, but I did not like this one.  The sound at times was tiny like old  game music, very repetitive, and droning.  I would have liked it better if it was some good space music, or it was produced a bit better.","5253":"Perfect for what I needed it for.","5254":"great song and artist","5255":"Old school gold","5256":"I like the way this song makes me feel. a Warm Happy feeling.  The bridges in the song make the song.","5257":"Beautiful and romantic. I love that Simple Plan seems to have stepped back from their whiny annoying lyrics and into something more concrete.","5258":"stupid","5259":"Nevahurd comes in barrels BLAZING! If you sleep on  this, pray you don't wake up, cuz you're missing whats happening in HHH. Lyrically, production, its ALL top notch...stop being cheap and get that..","5260":"This is not muscular stress reduction on many areas of your body where it really counts and\/or HOW do do it properly. He should explain more. He says, \"tighten and relax\" the muscles. It's better, in my opinion to say \"expand and relax\" your muscles. Why? If you're stressed, they are already tight in the first place. I was hoping as a TV pro, he would be better but I've worked for psychs who have better techniques. Just my opinion. I found his mp3s seemed rushed, as if he was saying.....let me get this overwith. If you're going to sell relaxation audio, please do it better, Dr. L.\n\nYou may be wondering if I know so much, why did I bother buying it and another one. Two reasons. One: If you meditate, sometimes, it's nice to hear another voice to bring you to a differet level. Two, I was testing out whether I wanted to buy one of his books or not.....Not.","5261":"Bad","5262":"Just deep breathe when you're upset about anything. Free advice from me. No charge.\n\nHe says nhale on the count of five and exhale on the count of five which I think is too much deep breathing. Most relaxation tapes are inhale on three and exhale on three. By the way,  he doesn't say this but Inhale deeply and exhale very slowly and let it go, like a whisper......or you will probably cough and not relax. I saw him on Dr. Phil and thougth he was this great expert.......Not on relaxation breathing, he isn't......in my opinion. To each his own.","5263":"When downloaded the songs don't blend. Very unsatisfied.  Wish I could get a refund!","5264":"Sounds great, cd quality Fanfare for the Common Man (Version of Symphony No. 3, Fourth Movement)...\nLeonard Bernstein;New York Philharmonic","5265":"1.

I was cheated by an unscrupulous individual out to make a buck with no little tingling of a conscience to tell him to tell the truth and not sell the item for a premium price with a serious defect undisclosed.","5267":"Has nothing to do with Om Kolthoum.\nHonestly I would consider it a scam.\nWhen anyone buy for this singer it's about her voice and her music, I was excited it said non stop music.\nDon't waist you money","5268":"This product was so boring that I stayed awake waiting for something to change.  Even the sound of the ocean changes sometime!\nI finally turned it off and found the most boring audio book that I had stored.\nMaybe someday I will try another sound on this CD to see if it is interesting enough to soothe me into sleep.","5269":"Chirping birds don't help one to sleep :\/","5270":"Not Moonlight Sonata  it is Sonata Pathetique","5271":"I was looking for something in the 15-30 minute range as I wanted to use the didgeridoo track(s) to journey or meditate to. These tracks fit the bill. I also purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Didgeridoo-Meditation-An-Odyssey-Through-Consciousness\/dp\/B00370JAD8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Didgeridoo Meditation: An Odyssey Through Consciousness<\/a>. I didn't care for the water sounds for some reason so I only purchased the 3rd track off the album after listening to the samples. I feel the nature sounds really add to it and I like that it's just didgeridoo playing without a lot of new age\/digital enhancements. Playing the track makes me feel relaxed and yet energized and like I'm camping out sleeping under the stars. Recommended.","5272":"Nice","5273":"The most monumental sound I have ever heard in my entire life in the field of instrumental heavyness, I run out of superlatives to describe this magnificent release for these four germans, artwork seems to describe perfectly the vibe that RISE delivers, track after track you will find highly addictive and enjoyable tunes, im really looking forward for Tank86 sophomore effort , I WANT MORE!!!!!","5274":"I have heard better....","5275":"just ok","5276":"Item maybe fine but, Seriously, I don't want to use your player! If I download an MP3 it's on my terms not yours!","5277":"I like this selection for evening relaxation while getting ready for bed. The soundtrack is very close to actual nature sounds. I recommend this because of the authenticity of what a natural stream would sound like with just the right amount of accompaniment of sounds at a volume that sounds real, the sound of the bird is soft, more quiet as if it were in the distance. I have sampled and purchased other similar soundtracks that are trying to hard to mimic nature with over use of nature sounds and random placement that is not relaxing at all. Many a night I have drifted into wonderful sleep, this definitely helps me quiet my mind and relax.","5278":"started out good but got slowly worse not really good to work out to could have been a lot better for an Ibiza mix terrible","5279":"I do not own it yet, will have it soon, looks reall good, but got to save up money for my fire tablet that was stolen.","5280":"This is pretty relaxing...I do listen to it occasionally  to rest\/relax","5281":"This was disappointing. Listening to the short previews of the music, it seemed OK. But listening to the entire album made me realize how uninspired the accordion pieces were. The few piano selections were good.","5282":"too fast paced for massage therapy music.....","5283":"My favorite!","5284":"On this album, they decided to add some reverberation effect to try to mask the 2 second loop. The result is a space-age, other-worldly liquid sound that doesn't sound right to me.","5285":"Although this album does provide water effects, there isn't enough variety.  Too much \"heavy wave\" sounds with little \"babbling brook\" sounds.  Not the best water effect album.","5286":"I needed some music for our dinner party and knew I would not be able to use anything from my regular music collection because my tastes lean more to the progressive\/progressive metal side of the musical spectrum. I would have no problems eating dinner to Kamalot, Rush or King Crimson but My wife and our guests would not like it. I got this downloadable album just for dinner parties and it's great! It's not so sleepy that you fall face first in your food and It has a lively tempo that is still subtle enough to have conversations. the price is right. So you should get it. It also works great in playlists","5287":"Jill's old poetry style needs a lift. Getting off the subject --I believe that Amazon would receive much more feedback on the songs that customers have purchased if Amazon would not make it a requirement to submit an entire paragraph.  The world is busy enough trying to prevent a huge daily accumulation if emails in their mailbox. All of the songs that I purchased from Amazon.","5288":"Amazing song...very lovely. The lyrics capture the essence of the song and the beat is really wonderful. I recommend this product to everyone who loves the feel of old school and Jill Scott.","5289":"Jill, Jill, Jill!

My hometown native.","5292":"Didn't buy","5293":"Love these bird songs as I go to sleep or in the early morning. They are so natural - not loud - with only a little background \"white noise\". I'd like to wake up to this, but haven't figured out how to set my Mp3 player to do that!","5294":"This in fact in NOT the recording. The credits of the film say that one of the sopranos is Kiri Te Kanawa...that is true.\nThis recording is most obviously NOT Dame Kiri Te Kanawa.\nIf you want to buy that recording search for her on a recording conducted by Sir Georg Solti from the '80s.\nOr look here: http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mozart-Figaro-Kiri-Te-Kanawa\/dp\/B0000041OU\nThere you will find the beauty you are looking for.\nEnjoy.","5295":"the sound record is horrible,the sound record is horriblethe sound record is horriblethe sound record is horriblethe sound record is horrible","5296":"Classic 80's hip hop.

Music needs to be on computer for me to use in video...","5300":"The sound quality is awful. It seems like while recording someone was increasing and decreasing the volume every second. Creates terrible amount of sound pressure on the ears. To the extent that one can have an headache listening to this track. Save your money don't buy this piece of garbage.","5301":"wouldn't burn to the cd. Said there were errors or it wasn't complete or I don't own burning rights. What's the point of buying the mp3 if i don't have the rights???","5302":"I downloaded this sound intending to copy to a cd to play. It says there are errors and won't burn.","5303":"I love music with feeling! A little dark, but beautifully melodic. I love the range.","5304":"I have been looking everywhere for items of great prices that I can't buy in Australia and Amazon seems to have everything I'm after at a fraction of the cost. Very reliable and helpful site with excellent quality items. Thank you, Amazon!","5305":"As a huge collector of U.S. cd singles I was very excited to see a release of GaGa's Judas, that is until I read the fine print \"This product is manufactured on demand using CD-R recordable media\". So not only is this inferior to an actual record label release, it is also priced 4 to 6 dollars more. WHY? Contrary to what another reviewer stated, the U.S. cd single is far from dead. Last year it had it's first increase in total sales in more than 15 years & that trend is continuing in 2011. Anybody who keeps close tabs on the Billboard charts would know that. There are more titles available as cd singles on the HOT 100 than there has been in years. The difference now is that many are exclusives. Last year WalMart led the way with 17 exclusives & some of their stores even started promoting cd singles. Other stores like Justice, Target, Hot Topic & Borders & independent record stores have had exclusives & even some artist websites like Taylor Swift are selling them. Some of the bigger titles released were California Girls by Katy Perry, F**k you by Cee Lo Green, Nothin' On You by B.o. B., Pretty Good At Drinkin' Beer by Billy Currington, Stuck Like Glue by Sugarland, DJ Got Us Falling in Love\/OMG by Usher, Misery by Maroon 5, What The Hell by Avril Lavigne, Black & Yellow\/Roll Up by Whiz Khalifa, Honey Bee by Blake Shelton, Just A Kiss by Lady Antebellum, Mean & The Story Of Us by Taylor Swift & Super Bass by Nicki Minaj as well as a bunch by Lady Gaga.","5306":"Really have no comment.

Waiting to see if he will put out more music.","5310":"Wish I read the reviews before purchasing this. I gave it as a gift and was so embarrassed to find out the songs on the CD were sung by rip off artists. :-(","5311":"Mediocre covers at best.  Don't buy this CD if you want the real thing.","5312":"These songs are not performed by the original performers.  They are done by a cover band.  Amazon does not give you any indication that this is so.  Avoid it if it matters to you.","5313":"great song- the words of 1Pet 5.6, but the quality of the recording is not even close to the quality of the original albumn.","5314":"Beware - beware - beware. This sound quality on this is absolutely dreadful. They've taken what was a well-recorded, mono recording and put it through some type of processor which now makes it sound worse than the original lp.\n\nAND - this is not the complete concert.","5315":"oh yeah","5316":"Cd  only had 2 1\/2 songs on it.","5317":"Why are all these songs live?

Bassist \/ vocalist \/ knob twiddler, Evan Brass, has certainly earned his bonus with a razor sharp production which effortlessly leaps out of the speakers, grabbing the listener by the collar, and demanding full, unwavering attention.\n\nEPs work brilliantly for new bands without a full album of songs to release, but equally there's absolutely no room for filler, and it's to the band's credit they understand completely the stipulations of the format. All five songs deliver maximum hooks and thrills, and it's obvious from the moment opening track \"Breaking Down Takes Two\" hits its chorus, we're in the hands of a band making the most of their opportunity.\n\nIf you've yet to discover them, now's the time - before they go mega.","5320":"This is truly a great selection of songs. I know I'm treading on thin ice here, doubly so because of both the singer and the songs sung on this set of mp3 selections.\n\nI only became aware of Al Jolson back in the late 1970's or early 1980's after seeing \"The Jolson Story\", and it wasn't really the star that impressed me so much as it was his voice and singing style along with the songs sung. People argue that he was one of those who sang in minstrel shows and in black-face which only served to further stereotype and denigrate African-Americans of the times, and to enjoy his music now only further serves to do the same. I can't speak to that. I wasn't there, but I know those were different times, and Jolson was playing to different audiences with different mindsets. My Parents listened to Foster's songs, which was how I grew to enjoy them, but hearing Jolson sing them was truly an enjoyable event. There was never a desire to see Jolson all dressed up in black-face, however. I don't admire the man that much!\n\nAs for this selection of mp3 downloads, I am not Jewish, so I can't speak to the few selections chosen that represent his religious upbringing, but, as I said, I have always enjoyed Stephen Collins Foster's songs, ever since I was a child in the late 1950's, when it was still politically correct to listen to them. And to combine the voice of Al Jolson with the tunes of Stephen Foster, even in these times when it may not be politically correct to listen or play such songs, I say is like a match made in heaven.\n\nFor those of you who like and admire this singer, these songs would make a great addition to your collection as they are much different that the usual show tunes you hear him sing, and only add to the bulk of his repertoire already existent.","5321":"The correct title of this recording is That Glory Day. It is the same song recorded by Una Mae Carlisle in 1944. Unfortunately, this hard-to-find version by Wingy on the Hallmark label is slightly better than transistor-radio quality. It is either a badly-done disc to mp3 transfer or a transfer from a really worn 78. This version for historical interest only.\n\nThere is a much more listenable version of the same recording available through another music service but it would have required downloading an unwanted storefront and player software just to purchase the track. Hopefully Amazon, in the future, will be able to offer a much better version of the recording than this one without purchasers having to jump through hoops to download it.","5322":"If you are an Ellington\/Strayhorn fan this 1960 album will grab you with some excellent renditions of Take the A Train and Do Nothing Until You Hear from Me that clearly have the Mingus touch.\n\nMingus had an unabashed admiration for Ellington, which probably culminated as a high point when he and Max Roach collaborated with Ellington on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Money-Jungle\/dp\/B000SZDMES\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Money Jungle<\/a>. Like that album, Max and Mingus are paired on this one. I must say that as much as I admire Max I prefer Dannie Richmond when paired with Mingus because the way Mingus and Richmond would stretch and compress time, almost telepathically, intrigues me. It also influences my own playing when I am with the right musicians. With Max none of that stuff happens.\n\nThe entire album is classic Mingus. Indeed, it was originally released as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Pre-Bird\/dp\/B000VRITJG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pre-Bird<\/a>, but in typical Mingus fashion it was repackaged. And, as if to underscore that, Mingus Fingus No. 2 on the original becomes Chazz Fingers No. 2 here.\n\nInstead of my trying to dissect the tracks, just give them a listen from the sound samples on this page. If you are a Mingus fan, chances are you will like what you hear. If so, instead of immediately pulling the trigger, first check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/5-Classic-Albums\/dp\/B0071XS3US\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">5 Classic Albums<\/a>, which is a value-priced set of Mingus albums and where I obtained my copy of this one.","5323":"This is my Christmas music this year.

He mentioned Machel Montano.  My roots is actually Tobago, Trinidad's sister island.  When I was a little girl, my parents took me to Trinidad & Tobago often to visit, hearing my family members and friends talk is hilarious.  \"Push Bumper\" is a really cool Soca song.  Don't feel guilty if you giggle while listening to it, that is actually the way the T&T accent sounds.  The Tobagonian radio stations in Tobago played it a lot while I was visiting my Dad's house, still under construction in Tobago between June 2011 and early August 2011.  I had fun.\nThere is a lot of specific organized drums and a tiny organ like sound in the background which riddles the song throughout, making it sweet-sounding.  Machel's voice is robust and demanding.  Enjoy!!!!","5337":"Good thing this download was only .89. While the cricket noise is pleasant (and what I was looking for)the very faint yapping dog in the background is not. Deleted it as soon as I heard the dog.","5338":"I bought this cd after listening to some clips of the songs. After I received it and listened to it a few more times I hated it. The singers voice is extremely annoying. Only 3 songs were actually tolerable and I ended up deleting those songs off my playlist eventually too.

Otherwise the song is nice and could be romantic, you could be getting into a nice groove with your partner and all of a sudden you hear the f*** and P*** words to take you right out of the mood!!! It's just unnecessary.","5341":"Bought a couple of songs that I like","5342":"I love Suzy Bogguss rendition of the old folk songs I learned as a child.  Im learning to play along with several of her songs on my ukelele.  I am however, disappointed that there is a flaw in the recording of the CD midway thru the song Sweet Betsy From Pike -  it just skips and skips and never continues with the song.  There is no visible scratch on the CD.  Oh well, all the other songs play beautifully.","5343":"What a wonderful gift to America and its music lovers.  These priceless songs are true gems of our country's history, so beautifully sung. I got the companion book which tells wonderful stories about each song too.","5344":"Great compilation of traditional tunes!","5345":"Neewer 3.5mm Hands Free Computer Clip on Mini Lapel MNeewer 3.5mm Hands Free Computer Clip on Mini Lapel Microphone (5X Lapel...icrophone (5X Lapel...","5346":"Disappointing.  We had a very old vinyl record with Emil Gilels playing, liked it so much better, more lyical, lighter touch, just more sensitive playing all around.  I don't think the Gilels is available any more.","5347":"A popular song refreshed by Dougie MacLean's rendition.","5348":"The best change up rock band ever. The lyrics are steeped with meaning. My favorite rock album.","5349":"Envi&oacute; vinilo rayado !!","5350":"Top disc. well pleased.","5351":"I have 'Home Sweet Home' and another of Alisa Jone's albums. I used them as cheerful 'filler' in my large iTunes library of mostly Country & Western and Western music.  Even thought I condisider them as a secondary selection I always enjoy when Jone's music plays.  Not flashy, just great and enjoyable music.\n\nListen to this album by itself and You will feel as you have lit a fireplace and an apple-cinnimon candle. Better yet: Light the fireplace and candle -and- play Jone's music.","5352":"no","5353":"Nothing special, good for basic workout, and light jogging, but not worth more than the 1$ I paid for it.","5354":"ok","5355":"I DJ and I wasn't too impressed by this mix. Step up your game Joe Chan and put some bangers on your mixes.","5356":"wonderful set, as described, thanks!","5357":"WAS TOLD IT WAS SHIPPED!! THEN AFTER 3-4 WEEKS WAS TOLD ITEM WAS NEVER SENT AND NEVER HAD THE ITEM IN THE FIRST PLACE!!","5358":"Buzzy Linhart is a great artist. I love his voice and his songwriting. I recommend his records highly. Buy it.","5359":"Excellent song\nTells a very profound story","5360":"If you like this album, you must make a beeline to \"Going Places\" from 1965. Recent;y I listened to them side by side. Both LPs are very adventurous within an easy-listening paradigm. Both are impeccably arranged. \"Fandango\" holds together better as a whole, perhaps because it was intended for the latin american market, while \"Going Places\" is a bit more \"over the map\" in its selections. \"Going Places\" hit number one on the Billboard charts while \"Fandango\" didn't, but that was not for the lack of critical acclaim. Listen to them both and you'll hear easy listening music at its best!","5361":"I think Herb Alpert is a gift from above to this earth to brighten my day.","5362":"love it","5363":"Just perfect for calm background music. I like falling asleep listening to it.","5364":"I loved it!!! Can't wait for the album to be released!!!","5365":"Great music, lousy MP3.  I was excited to download this rare find.  The MP3 is mediocre.  It clearly came from an LP on a turntable. In addition to some of the expected pops and hiss inherent to worn LP and stylus, there are moments of exceptional distortion. My old cassette copy sounds better.","5366":"This hard-to-find particular version is far-and-above the best in my opinion.  I had the original LP back in the late 70's but it got scratched\/lost, so I was blessed to find the MP3 version on-line here at Amazon (at a far lower price than the 1970's LP despite inflation :-)","5367":"Sounds like it was copied from an old LP.  Parts of songs have hiss and scratch sounds in it. Amazon should better quality standards!","5368":"Horrible recording overpowered by bad saxaphone.","5369":"This is not an album from Being in Him, though they use the name, Christian Relaxation & meditation on Scripture. Don't be confused.","5370":"This an awesome song! The beat is very upbeat! Makes you want to lift your hands and praise the Lord!","5371":"Careful with this one.  It's not the Kit Kats group. Instead it's an album made by the keyboard artist from the band.\nAll new and different recordings of their old songs with a few others mixed in. The songs you identify with the Kit Kats are completely different recordings done instrumentally. Karl Hausman sings on 3 songs that I don't recognize. The others are instrumentation produced electronically.","5372":"This is another song on my workout playlist. If you need a fast paced and upbeat song this is it. Machel doesn't disappoint.","5373":"Uncommon Valor: A Vietnam Story is quite possibly THE single best hip hop song I have ever heard in my entire life.  And I'm not the only one who thinks so.  May people argue, and I think justifiably so, that the second verse by Rugged Man is the best verse in hip hop ever.  Seriously, if someone ever asks you to demonstrate the difference between good hip hop and bad hip hop, first have them listen to Bedrock and them show them this.\n\nBut all that said, I can't seem to actually download it because of the new, non-intuitive cloud drive system thingy we have now because Amazon decided to fix something that wasn't broken.  For that reason, I can't give this five out of five stars.","5374":"I wanted to curl up and die when i heard this rancid cassette.. i wound up blowing chunks after heard the sorry excuses for singers for hours until i finally threw the tape on the floor and stomped it to pieces by jumping up and down on it like a deranged feces covered gorilla after digesting a bowl of Peruvian death peppers and hot black coffee!!! Never heard such crummy singers in my life!! They oughta be shaved bald and pelted with bowls of fermented oatmeal and donkey nuggets!! To say they morons stinks doesnt even to describe just how they truly truly suck!!!! Yaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!","5375":"I threw this imataton beach boys tape in the garbage. Lousy singers.","5376":"It was a mistake. I wanted to hear it beforehand n I recieved it automatically n want to exchange it but don't know how?","5377":"I picked this album up at a resale store several months back not knowing anything about this Artist\/Orchestra and I am SO happy I did;  I just played both records (2 album set) and it is amazing.  This is big band swing music at its best; full orchestra with solos by all different kinds of instruments...something that is lacking in music today.  The albums showcase songs as tributes to musical greats Glenn Miller, Counts Basie, Jimmy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey, Artie Shaw, and more included the fabulous Glen Gray and the Casa Loma Orchestra themselves.  Take a chance and buy this one, I bet you're going to love it.","5378":"Loved it!","5379":"So, I have been a fan of Julie's for quite a while. I think I wore out her last CD \"Men and Mascara\". This album is a solid follow-up to that album. I applaud Julie for trying to break out of the slow country ballad trap with some fun, up-tempo songs. But clearly, Julie's plaintive voice is most potent when she's singing about heartache. Just one listen to \"Whiskey and You\", \"One for the Road\" or \"Yesterday's Blue\", and you will be a fan. Although this is not as cohesive an album as her last, I still love her voice, and I would recommend it to any country music fan. I hope she continues to flourish and attract fans because she is a true undiscovered talent.","5380":"What did this soundtrack have anything to do with a Spider-Man narrative? Might as well call it \"generic Bono album.\"","5381":"Althought hearing the real thing is alwys better this helped let me pretend that I was there again. I enjoyed this musical and cd alot.","5382":"Dizzy Gillespie may be the greatest trumpet player in the history of jazz, and the listener will have some evidence of his genius on both sides of this scandalously \"under-documented\" recording.  Who knows where the music occurred and the names of the other musicians?  Any fan of Diz's artistry will have no difficulty distinguishing his trumpet among the cluttered sonics from which it emerges, but that's not enough reason to spend almost two dollars and the better part of an hour on a recording that merely demonstrates why a couple of anonymous, downloaded tracks are no substitute for the \"hard-copy CD.\"  Sure, it's not a lot of money, and it's Dizzy Gillespie (who moreover was once a perpetual Presidential candidate),  but I suspect I'm not the only one who recognizes a rip-off at any price.","5383":"I love this song but the audio quality sucks, It sucks on itunes also, I can't imagine the original recording at the\nstudio had the distortion that is in the mp3.\n\nI'm really sick of wasting money on these compressed and compromised audio files.\n\nA lossless version should always available, no one wants the hassle of dealing with CD's\nbut we want uncompressed music.\n\nOne star for killing a great song!","5384":"It's a beautiful song! Really gets my body moving, my head banging.","5385":"Never heard would like to","5386":"I purchased the least expensive version, but I was disappointed in the quality of the recording. It's still beautiful music!","5387":"This is an OLD recording and the audio is pretty bad.  I had to download a different version for use in the recital.","5388":"Sounded as if someone recorded it via their cell phone or worse. My community Orchestra simple recording sounds 10 times better, still it served it's purpose.. that was to expose me to the composition prior to rehearsing it with my home musical group. Not close to any professional recording quality.","5389":"\"Holy Ecstasy\" turely is what it's title says that it is: \"Holy Ecstasy\". It is truely awesome. I love to listen to it over and over in a meditative Spirit! The wonderful presence of God is felt in this atmosphere of worship and praise to our Holy God Almighty!!","5390":"Not the version junior used to play at arena","5391":"I was expecting the song \"Un Grand Amour\", the same recording as in my old vinyl, but it was not. This was the only reason I bought this album. I am disappointed.","5392":"This album has songs which were career makers for other singers all written by Buzz Linhart. I have had these tunes in my head for 40 years since I lived in New York and Buzzy was heard locally there. Thank you to the producers for allowing us to have these beautiful, soulful tunes as sung by Buzz.","5393":"It was alright.","5394":"this song is great for Zumba has a really good beat to it and I'd definitely love the lyrics","5395":"Great dance music - motivating for exercise, dancing, housework.","5396":"Great music for my party!","5397":"This is one of my favorite 'blow your ear drums out' (and your neighbor's) songs. Amazon has an amazing selection of music. I have never had a problem with downloads and they are very affordable.","5398":"Very poor quality mp3 rip.  I'm not sure if the original CD audio has the same amount of clipping, however, many new audio recordings do.  This is just one more example of poor mastering on CDs and even poorer mp3 encoding of CDA material.","5399":"Love this song to zumba to!  Glad there is clean version to it so I don't have issues with my kids when they hear it.","5400":"I love running to this upbeat tune.  The lyrics are rather nasty, depending upon your taste, but I don't mind.  I like Pitbull.","5401":"Good song","5402":"I don't actually like this song, and downloaded it on accident. I'm not sure why but it just sounds like \"typical Pitbull\" so while it's catchy, it's just.... okay.","5403":"I've heard earlier recordings by this artist that are wonderful and light and lyrical. You cannot hear the flirtaciousness our young sorrow anymore in the voice. It was nice of her to keep people employed by making this album, but she should have just re-released her best recordings.","5404":"Some tracks have gaps and other tracks cut off.","5405":"I listened to the clip on Amazon and really liked it.  What I didn't realize, is that it starts out with a mini interview.  Doesnt flow with a Christmas playlist.","5406":"Hardcore punk.  But very good and fun.  You can hear the early talent.","5407":"Actually the song is great. The problem is I just paid $10. for a cd with one song on it. What an F-ing rip off!","5408":"Simply a nice rhythm and it entire tune is good","5409":"This album is a disappointment. Most of the songs skip and jump. ","5410":"Top Notch!! Outstanding service!!","5411":"I love Jolie Holland's voice. She is so unique, there are no real comparisons. I guess one could liken her vocal earthiness to Lucinda Williams, if Lucinda sang the blues like Odetta. But really, you have to listen to this incredible woman and appreciate that she is unlike anyone else!","5412":"The musical setting of \"All Those Girls\" is pretty enough, but nothing special.  The lyrics, which speak of betrayal, are likewise nothing special, but they're not bad either.  I would have moderately enjoyed this song if not for one thing.\n\nJolie Holland's voice.\n\nI don't have a problem with deep and husky voices, per se.  It was just last week that I gave a five-star review to Marianne Faithfull's \"Why Did We Have to Part,\" and I've adored Julia Fordham for years.  However, there's something about Holland's voice that just grates on me.  Maybe it's the way she slurs her words sometimes so that it's hard to make out exactly what she's singing (did she go right to the recording studio after a root canal or something?).  Maybe it's that her heavy, breathy huskiness reminds me of the voice of a longtime cigarette smoker.  Perhaps it's her whiny tone, or the way she seems to be trying to swallow and sing at the same time, or just a feeling I have that she cares more about her affected delivery - I mean, her \"unique style\" - than what she's singing.\n\nWhatever it is, I don't like it.  It's not a terrible song, but I'd definitely recommend listening to the sample before you download.","5413":"Been following Jeff Wood since last year.  Live near San Antonio so my friends, family, and I are fortunate enough to see him live quite often.\nThis album is my second favorite by him (Come What May being my favorite).  A few of the songs that stand out are Little Outlaw (my girlfriends' favorite), Wyoming Skies, Heroes, and Cell Phone Junkies.  Borrowed Time is very good.\nThe beats in his music are sometimes slow tempo, sometimes fast.  He has a wide range which is one of the reasons everyone who hears his music ends up enjoying it.\nIf you are tired of the same old music being put out by mainstream and are looking for something with substance, heart, and overall great music, then try this album.  His music always brightens my day.\nAs he always jokingly says at his shows \"This album is highly recommended by the artist\".\nIt's also highly recommended by me.","5414":"This was an unexpected treasure found here.  I understand it's also available in Barnes & Noble now (12\/2013).  This CD contains several Bing Christmas recordings that have never been on CD before, the most exciting to me is the inclusion of Bing reciting \"Night Before Christmas\"!!  Also included is the rare original 45 \"Christmas Star\" and another one not on CD before is \"Away In the Manger\" taken from one of Bing's annual Christmas Eve Around The World broadcasts, this song includes his little woman singing along with Der Bingle.  Night Before Christmas & Away In Manger were both released only on a 45 just a couple years ago, but I didn't want to buy it on 45, I wanted it on CD.  So I was thrilled to see them finally now on CD.  OK, here's what you all want to know, \"What are the songs on this CD anyway???\"\nHere's the CD contents:\n1. Rudolph Red Nosed Reindeer\n\n2. Just What I Wanted For Christmas (Another great original 45 release from '60's)\n\n3. Secret of Christmas (from the movie \"Say One For Me\")\n\n4. Peace On Earth Little Drummer (can't stand this one, it's everywhere)\n\n5. White World of Winter (Wow, another original 45 only release)\n\n6. Let It Snow...\n\n7. It's Christmas Time Again (one of my favorite Bing Christmas songs from '60's)\n\n8. Marshmallow World w\/Ella Fitzgerald\n\n9. Good King Wenceslas\n\n10. Joy To The World\n\n11. Christmas Star (a great little original 45 release)\n\n12. Little Town of Bethlehem\n\n13. Away In A Manger (w\/Lady Kathryn)\n\n14. The Night Before Christmas (the real rare find for me the guy who already has everything Bing)","5415":"This is probaly good if your a racist bigot and you like to blame everyone else for your own decline. Don't waste your time.","5416":"If anyone is interested in joining a cult, this may be for you, if not, save your money.  He is very nice and appears to be spiritual, unless you disagree with him, then the dark side manifests itself.","5417":"OK, so I admit that I don't go to Mysore practice nearly enough times each week and that I don't know the finishing chant very well so maybe Madonna is operating on a plane way above my level of Ashtanga experience but...oh my god this work is awful.  Nothing like taking the Invocation to Patanjali and applying a jingly treatment to the lyrics and a bouncy Caribbean music track.  She definitely doesn't \"Vande Gurunam\" to the great sage.  I guess she was thinking \"if it feels good then I say do it, I don't know what you're waiting for\" about a decade ago.","5418":"LOVE IT","5419":"I could tell from the cover this was a reissue but it was not described as MONO.","5420":"This sounded like a vanity project, experimenting with different sounds and rhythms which may resonate with some fans of Electronica.  I couldn't get into it.  But I can and do recommend \"Deadline\" and, especially if you're new to Dave Perkins, \"Pistol City Holiness\" is -ALWAYS- on my Playlist.\nPerhaps Amazon could create audio samples from \"Sheeple\" that could help prospective buyers make draw their own conclusions.  Please don't write off Dave Perkins on the basis of this: I've been a fan since \"The Innocence\" came out back in 1987 and am eager to hear what he'll come out with next.","5421":"This isn't the version I was looking for lol\n\nI liked the 'hood version'. lol\n\nIt's still the same song for the most part though","5422":"Good CD","5423":"music is kind of just ok--boring","5424":"What a great band! Excellent New England Soithern Rock. Waiting for the reunion concert. Life quenching!","5425":"I had been looking for this record, yes record, for a very long time. It's for a friend's birthday. She dropped out of beauty school 30 some years ago, and it is kind of a running joke. She will love it!!!","5426":"Archie Brownlee, with the possible exception of Dorothy Love Coates, was the greatest gospel singer ever.  I know many of these songs from other records, and it's some first rate stuff.  Unfortunately, the disc they sent we was not finalized and won't play on my cd player, the computer doesn't even recognize it's existence.","5427":"I love this song and this artist.","5428":"Dottie West is always great.  Nice to have this 45 in my collection.  Thanks.","5429":"Possibly the worst song to ever chart, although anemically, in the UK. Meekly sung, no melody, and derivative. Lovelady, now an Uber driver, has dined out on this one recorded record ever since.","5430":"It's ok if you like synth music, the whole album is made up of it. I was looking for the hot main theme song, \"Let Go\" by Intimate Strangers.. I cannot find it anywhere on CD just vinyl.. so I just went ahead and bought the album, thinking it was on it since it was the main theme song of the movie, and you are buying the motion picture soundtrack.. but no disappointment, what a waste. Unfortunately at the time when I bought it, there wasn't a review listed  that the songs were not included on the soundtrack..so you are only buying instrumental music which the album wasn't bad but really had nothing to it.","5431":"if you like just music thats fine i guess, but i bought this cd awhile back and i thought it was the songs from the movie it wasn't, what a rip off.","5432":"This vendor is rude, unprofessional, has not ability to do the right thing. My husband died days after the purchase, I canceled the charge because of his unwillingness to do are turn. My husband was very ill when he ordered the record, no exception with this a-- hole. Steer clear of this ----","5433":"With a completely different cover, this 1978, 45 - 7\" single off Alice's 'From The Inside' album of his fourth sappy ballad \"How You Gonna See Me Now\" that looks to have been primarily released and available in Italy (at least when it first came out). I speculate this rare single would likely be tougher to find an actual copy of than the other single with a cover of Alice wearing no make-up.","5434":"This is an awesome vinyl record, arrived in perfect condition. It is awesome to have a live album that was never made digital. Would definitely buy from this seller again!","5435":"Bad espanol","5436":"Not a huge Fan. While the songs were familiar didn't really like the singing or the tempo of the cd. It's just ok","5437":"After three successful albums in the early 1980s and 7 R&B hit singles (one of them reaching #1, \"Lovelite\"), O'Bryan finally releases his fourth and final effort by the end of 1986.  Even at his peak in 1984, O'Bryan still struggled a bit to reach the same success as many other R&B hit makers and now as of 1986, the competition was a lot tougher with Anita Baker, Janet Jackson, Loose Ends, and Freddie Jackson dominating the R&B charts that year.  Hip-Hop\/rap music had already made a themselves a genre as nearly as equal to R&B and pop.  New Jack Swing music was slowly emerging by that point of which fused Hip-Hop and club oriented songs with R&B.\n\nSince 1984's Be My Lover success, O'Bryan spent nearly 3 years coming up with a good follow up that would adapt to the change of pop\/R&B music, but there was not much luck in those fields, however he managed to gain one last hit, \"Tenderoni\" (#35, R&B) that became a club hit in early 1987.  Unlike his previous albums, O'Bryan and Soul Train host, Don Cornelus didn't produce all of the songs.  O'Bryan recruited Jerry Knight (ex-Raydio member and ex-Ollie & Jerry fame) and Aaron Zigman to write and produce three of the 8 tracks that includes the slammin' \"Tenderoni\" and the sensitive and heartbreaking, \"You Have Got To Come To Me.\"  The latter didn't chart, but in my opinion it sounds better than The Jets' 1986 hit, \"You Got It All\" (also produced by Knight and Zigman).  I think the 7 inch edited single version was better because the album version just repeats the chorus (too redudant), plus the sound quality wasn't that great.  The best song on the album has to be \"What Goes Around\" which was also produced by Knight and Zigman and is a tuff dance track that should have been his second single, but Capitol records blindly chose the silly \"Driving Force\" as a single instead.  The only O'Bryan\/Cornelius produced song I enjoyed from this album would have to be \"Is This For Real\" of which is a sentimental and beautiful new jack ballad that was far longed overlooked.  Now that song is Surrender's best ballad.  Before someone sends their hate mail to me, I wasn't that fond of the ballad, \"Maria,\" but it wasn't his worst song.  The title track was a dissapointment (instrumental was a rip off of Luther Vandross' \"Give Me A Reason\") while \"Dreamin' Of You\" was musically and vocally \"way too busy and unappealing.\"\n\n\"Tenderoni,\" \"What Goes Around,\" and \"Is This For Real\" were the only highlights of the lp with \"You Have Got To Come To Me\" rating 3.9 out of 5 (mid light). It was great that O'Bryan shared production duties with 2 top R&B producers, but I think many of the songs suffered from the repetitive chorus lines and instrumentals.  I think the album was sabatoged just like O'Bryan's career was shortly after the album's release.  It didn't help that there were many nasty rumors about O'Bryan circulating around the black music media that rode the passenger side with Capitol's bad deals for the 25 year old singer.  His dissappointment with the music industry prompted him to go on a early retirement from the business. Other than appearing on Karyn White's first album in 1988 (see linear notes) and Paul Jackson Jr's 1988 album, I Came To Play, as a featured vocalist, O'Bryan was non existent until 2007's mp3 (later cd) release, F1rst.  Out of all his albums that should be reissued and remastered to itunes, Surrender wouldn't have been much worth it.  I think Surrender would've done better with the wonder works of Reggie Calloway, LA Reid & Babyface, Nick Martinelli, and better yet Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis because O'Bryan definitely had the vocals and energy for their type of music.","5438":"I like the overall sound and quality of the product.","5439":"This is Huey Lewis' BEST album.  7 of the 9 songs received airplay.  4 of them charted.  If you have an interest in Huey Lewis or are on a renaissance, this is where you start.  The expanded edition is a nice, little bonus.","5440":"Been a big fan of JBA. He's so underrated and this is a great album long over due to be remastered. So I was really looking forward to this. I am very disappointed. To advertise this by Escape Records as a remaster is a joke. It is obvious by the clicks & pops & sporadic distortion, it's not from master taped but a vinyl transfer. My vinyl transfer I did is seriously better than this. This isn't the first time and I'm sure won't be the last. The record companies that do this should be ashamed to mislead people. The one plus is the artwork and packaging is top notch.","5441":"The sound is just ok,sounds like it was recorded off a record.","5442":"Yes, I admit it. I'm a 40+ year old woman who loves this song! Not sure if it's the lyrics, the beat, or both, but I do know it's made a wonderful addition to my workout playlist. It definitely keeps me motivated and moving when I hear it!","5443":"This is a review of both Noah Aronson's album \"Left Side of the Page\" and \"Am I Awake\" - I listen to them all in one playlist.\n\nNoah Aronson's music is great for helping out new converts to Reform Judaism, or the interfaith partner of a Reform Jew, or just really anyone who wants to know what a Reform Jewish religious service sounds like (so long as they use the prayerbook I mention below - which so far in my experience, most do).  All with some of the most beautiful voices out there, and really gifted musical arrangements.  I believe that Noah Aronson composed the melodies in this album (not positive on that though).\n\nSeveral of the songs in Left Side of the Page and most of the songs in his other album, Am I Awake, follow along with one of the main Reform prayerbooks, Mishkan T'filah, which I personally find really beautiful in itself. When I was trying to find sources for Jewish service prayers and songs, almost all the prayers I could find were Orthodox or Consertative and didn't align to the services I was attending.  And many had (sorry to be judgmental, but this is music and it's hard not to notice!) really strident voices, too \"old opera-y\" voices, and\/or awful accents in their Hebrew (eg \"Adonoy\" with an emphasis on the oy!).\n\nThis was a really nice change of pace - a guitar, a light male voice (tenor?), an easy switch back and forth between Hebrew and English, a light accent (more Israeli than Ashkenazi), pretty duets with pretty-voiced cantors and musicians (including one really cool Nickel Creek sounding guitar arrangement) and nice melodies.  A really nice, respectful, enjoyable listen - and a great way to learn your way through a service.\n\nThat said, if you're trying to learn how to chant prayers (some songs can be put to whatever music, while others have to be chanted according to the little squiggles in the Torah - sorry don't know the name of them), you should Google \"Temple Habonim V'ahavta\" and learn for free from Cantor Jodi Blankstein, who has an incredible voice.","5444":"This is one helluva dance tune! Horns a'freakin',bassline a'thumpin' & a'pumping,and TOTALLY RELENTLESS BEAT make this a true CLASSIC!\nEvery DJ (like me) should have this booty shakin',crowd pleasin' SMOKER!--forget the Paul Hardcastle electrofunk\nB-side--it just doesn't cut it--just BUY this slice of wax & be amazed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This is A BRAND NEW BAG & James Brown\nshould be LOUD & PROUD!!!!!--enuff said!","5445":"Beautiful album.","5446":"I always have enjoyed Foreigners work, but didn't expect much from this 2011 revisiting of some of their greatest hits. I Was Wrong! Its excellent, and has been playing pretty much nonstop since I bought it. Very Pleased","5447":"These are re-recordings not originals. If I had known that I would have passed. I do like a couple of the acoustic versions, but does not justify the purchase.","5448":"If  you are expecting remastered songs with Lou Gramm singing you will be disappointed. All the old songs are sung by the new singer who does not have the vocal range of Lou.","5449":"This album soothes me like very few others. When I was working the most stressful job I'd ever had, I also had no rest at home, but I had one hour to myself on my lunch break and I would listen to this album. I have very good memories of sitting in the parking lot due to Kyte. It was probably better than medicine.\n\nI get the feeling of \"this is going to be on the radio soon,\" like I had with Owl City a few years ago.","5450":"I first heard Rob's music when I came across his twitter account about a year ago, \"Dilemma\" was the first song I heard and I was so awestruck by his voice, very talented for sure!  I just downloaded \"Know\" to my MP3 App on my phone and this is a song that I \"know\" will make someone smile...it sure made me smile!  Thanks Rob for a another fantastic song!","5451":"this guy is a hater and i bought the album by accident. pretty good singer though. very very very very","5452":"I've purchased many of Michael Gott's albums and enjoyed them all, but his latest creation is his best.  It's full of uplifting and beautiful songs -- many of his own creation.  This CD will lift your heart!","5453":"if the recording is by Caniglia, then don't show a picture of Tebaldi as Desdemona with the listing!!!!!","5454":"An acceptable mix of recent mid-pace mostly instrumental trance tracks.  There's nothing too extreme or attention-getting but solid none-the-less despite the lack of floor-filling tunes to flip this into the must-have category.","5455":"Who make you laugh so hard you will cry! Funny funny funny guy!","5456":"Best kept secret.... found this gem while listening to Pandora. Never heard of this brotha till now, and Oooooweee am I glad I did. Amazing!","5457":"I hate this song,I only got it to make fun of on my dj machine. This song stinks and has a old 1970s sound. Dont buy to like, buy to make fun of","5458":"Good music, what you'd expect from Hawkins & Webster . . .  Roy Eldridge sounds great too.\n\nBut look out! This version was mastered from a beatup vinyl record, not a master tape. Occasional surface noises are definitely noticeable on several tracks, including a scratch that makes an audible sound each time the turntable needle goes around and hits it again (on track 2).\n\nThis is a really weak move, and should have been mentioned in the album description.\n\nIt looks like the same material is available here on mp3 from another label as Ben Webster's YOUNG BEAN, and the previews there sound good as far as I can tell. You might want to spend a couple dollars more and get that recording rather than this one.","5459":"WOW!!! Every song was really good. I play it all the time on my Kindle Fire, thats why I am gave it 5 stars. I everyone will give this a try. Enjoy!!!","5460":"Walking down memory lane, and this ranked high. Good singing voice, words for the time and easy to strum on guitar.","5461":"I love the artistry of E.S. My one star rating is for the bad job of digitizing this song. The beginning of the song absent, then there is the sound of the record needle raking across the vinyl bands. Inexcusably poor job of digitizing this masterwork. Unusable.","5462":"The song starts on the 16th measure to the end! What happened with the measures 1 to 15? I'm so frustrated!!!","5463":"These tracks are all really low volume for some reason. I had to use a sound manipulation program (Audacity) to amplify them.\n\nAccording to a comprehensive online discography of Tommy Ladnier, there were six takes (not \"parts\") of \"Play That Thing\" --- a bluesy 1923 track with Jimmie Noone. This is the only mp3 source of takes 3 and 4 that I'm aware of. Each take is different enough that they are all interesting to me. You can search for mp3s and sort them all by length to separate out the different takes.\n\nIf you just want a decent collection of Tommy Ladnier, look elsewhere, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Tommy-Ladnier\/dp\/B001W9CVLO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tommy Ladnier<\/a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/1923-1939\/dp\/B00002791Y\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">1923-1939<\/a>.\n\nI highly recommend the tracks \"Play That Thing\" (esp. what is called here Part 1), \"Peepin' Blues,\" \"Muddy Water Blues\" (Jelly Roll Morton), \"Barrel House Blues\" (Ma Rainey), and the classic \"Really the Blues\" (Sidney Bechet), all of which contain Ladnier solos.\n\nIf you are seriously into Ladnier, there is a book and mp3 collection available on the same website as his discography.","5464":"Downloaded this tract which did have some scratches in it which was acceptable to me considering it was an old song; however, the first few lyrics were distorted which was totally unacceptable. I promptly notified Amazon of this and I had been given a refund. Thank you Amazon again. I don't recommend this tract to anyone unless a new replacement tract is offered.","5465":"Good sound.","5466":"Sound is horribly distorted. Not worth even four bucks.","5467":"This is a NICE trumpet date. Long time fav. Get the OJC Limited Edition, NOT this poorly remastered crap.","5468":"The lead singer introduced this song at a recent show being revealing that it was about their bass player reconnecting with an ex.  We've all done that, I guess.  Sweet and gentle, but clear-eyed and not overly sentimental.  Nice harmonies on this one.  Also nice to hear 'crick' used in a rock song :)","5469":"Here, we have 2 arranged songs and 3 soundtracks in 1.  Track 1 is an arrangement of ghouls n ghosts (daimakaimura).  Track 2 is an arrangement of MegaMan 2 (rockman 2) after that, we have the original arcade soundtracks of lost world (forgotten worlds), 1943, and daimakaimura (ghouls n ghosts).  The 1943 soundtrack is not the same version as the Nintendo version.  However, I believe this version of the game can be found on Capcom classics for PS2.  I think this is a great set of soundtracks worth every penny.  So, grab a copy quickly before the price goes up!!!","5470":"I received a Mariah Carey CD!!!  Don't make the same mistake I did.  If it seems a bit fishy and there are no reviews, be sure to verify with the merchant what you are actually purchasing.","5471":"I bought this because I think it's so hilariously terrible that I wanted to share it with friends and family.at Christmas.","5472":"I could not hear the song on my Kindle Fire.","5473":"Love Nona!  This is a great jam!!!","5474":"Passion and flavor flows through the album! Great album!","5475":"This is a wonderful CD .plays Oscar,  Just like the man himself. Lots of great music to listen too.fantastic.vincent is great pianist.","5476":"I bought this from Amazon because a recent email interaction with the snobs at Kranky put me off of doing any business with them at all - though this eventually trickles to them... the music on this album is great, but like ALL OTHER KRANKY albums I have bought in 15 years is full of dust and static knicks... I don't know who presses their vinyl, but gosh... can I be the only one in all these years who has such poor vinyl from Kranky?","5477":"UPDATE: 2017-03-28  Marvelio, the seller, sent me a new replacement record at no cost (kudos to Marvelio) however the same problems still exist. This time the record appeared clean, however the pops and click are almost nonstop. I've never had a problem like this for any new vinyl. And I have well used, poorly cared for, used vinyl that isn't as bad as this. It's really disappointing considering the music is quite good.\n\nBy it on CD, skip the vinyl.\n---\nOriginal Review:\n\nThe music is great however the vinyl comes loaded with dust and dirt. How a brand new vinyl can have so much dust and dirt, I don't know. As a result there's lots of pops and clicks which ruins the music since there are a lot of quite passages in the songs. Also the inner sleeve is too small for the record and it's torn on two edges before I've even removed the record.","5478":"When you click on \"Zac Brown\" it comes up with the Zac Brown from the country band, Zac Brown Band and all their albums, making you think that this is a recording with that Zac Brown.  Which it is not.  This should be fixed as fans of the country Zac Brown Band are being misled to think this is him.","5479":"In the annals of the One-Hit Wonder collection of musical artists, surely the group with the oddest band name was Q, a disco quartet in which all four contributed vocals as well as instruments (Robert Peckman bass, Don Garvin guitar, Bill Thomas keyboards and Bill Vogel drums). From Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, they met Mike Belkin and Carl Maduri of Cleveland who had just launched what was essentially a Disco music label, Sweet City, in the Cleveland suburb of Beachwood. This outfit had also worked out a distribution deal with Columbia's Epic subsidiary, and in 1977 they released this LP \"Dancin' Man\" (Epic 39641) containing: A1. Dancin' Man (2:38); A2. Do I Love You? (3:04); A3. Knee Deep In Love (3:08); A4. Feel It In Your Backbone, Got It In Your Feet (4:03); A5. Have I Sinned? (3:05); B1. Sweet Summertime (2:42); B2. If It Ain't One Thing, It's Another (3:17); B3. Feelin' That Rhythm To The Bone (2:41); B4. Make Us Once Again (r:17); B5. Jump For Joy (2:44).\n\nWhen it started its climb to a modest # 140 on Billboard's album charts, the single Dancin' Man was rushed out as Epic\/Sweet City 50335), eventually reaching # 23 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in late March\/early April 1977 b\/w Love Pollution (not part of the album). A later single from that album,  Sweet Summertime, topped out at # 108 Hot 100 Bubble Under in July b\/w If It Ain't One Thing It's Another (Epic\/Sweet City 50404), but in August, Feel It In Your Backbone, Got It In Your Feet b\/w Jump For Joy as Epic 50440 failed to make either chart.\n\nIt's probably unrealistic to think that a distributor would bother putting out a CD version of this album (perhaps Collector's Choice) in light of the fact they are such an obscure gathering, but it is surprising that their one big hit - and a # 23 wasn't a bad result considering the fact that over 450 songs made the Billboard Pop Hot 100 that year - has never even made its way into a multiple-artist compilation covering music of the Disco era. And there are a lot of them out there.","5480":"Streaming only. The sound quality on the streaming version of this magnificent recording is unspeakably awful.","5481":"I downloaded this song by mistake. I don't even remember purchasing it or what I thought it was because I don't think I would have downloaded Lionel Richie's song with the same name as this album either. Big mistake.","5482":"Bad Ass!","5483":"the og recordings are bad these versions are awful like all of pac's songs thjat's been remixed by whoever in charge of his catalog.","5484":"since I first heard SAIKI,I wanted to hear something else from LMFAO. While this song is not as cacthy as their debut song, I enjoyed it. If SAIKI is about a bacholor party, ONE NIGHT is a guy who misses his girl.","5485":"Did not know I ordered this!!","5486":"song","5487":"I love this Concerto, but my disc broke. I purchased this as a replacement, unfortunately the recording job is horrible. Lots of background static, the volume is too low in comparison with the norm, which is a shame since the orchestra sounds good. Guess I'll have to look over a few before I purchase this Concerto again.","5488":"A disappointing rendition of Ketelbey. Excessive variation in audio from very loud to very soft--so soft you can hardly hear it.","5489":"Just purchased this record to get a replacement sleeve for an existing have of this album. This is a very good Billy Vaughn recording. Even though there are others \"Summer Place\" is this oldest BV record I have in my collection. Dot's Ultra High Fidelity recording produced some of the very best stereo records I have ever heard and Biily Vaughn was certainly a very talented musician. The arrangements and studio mixing on these songs are first rate. Highly recommend if can find a very good or better used record. I happened to pick my copy at Goodwill for only one dollar. It only needed some cleaning. After that it has spinning regularly on my turntable.","5490":"only says it like two times in song.. Wasted my money on this song, and wouldnt recommed it to anyone.","5491":"I have thoroughly enjoyed this album.  I particularly liked the fact I could listen to tracks prior to purchasing.  It has provided many hours of soothing background for meditating and relaxation.","5492":"Greatest musician ever!","5493":"This is my favorite band as I was growing up, and to finally find this LP, is totally sweet. Plays great and not much wear and tear on this LP, recommend this to anyone that is a fan. Clearly a collectable and well worth having.","5494":"good thank you","5495":"I was so disappointed.  Much of the content was read from one of Dr. Hallowell's books, that I already had.  I thought the price was pretty high to begin with and then, after listening to the cd, felt really ripped off.\nIf you've never read his books, then you might like this.  The information is good.  I just felt like I had been 're-gifted' and paid WAY too much.","5496":"I love this song!  I first heard this song on \"Deadliest Catch.\"  It was used as a quite appropriate season closer when Captain Phil Harris passed.  This song has lyrics, melody, and building power that will grab you as a listener.\n\nIf you have read any of my other reviews (dexspinner) you know I purchase tons, yes tons, of music because I am a professional fitness instructor.  I have used this song in Yoga, Pilates, and as a cool down to almost every class.  It also is great for listening and I have shared it with countless friends and exercise participants.","5497":"I personally know Vince and have had an LP record of this from its original pressing,  But I no longer have a record player to play it.  So I went online and downloaded it to my Kindle so that I could listen to it again.  I am so glad that I can listen to his music at anytime I want.","5498":"It's the same orchestration as the original soundtrack, but it's played by a bad synthesizer instead of an orchestra. Listen to the preview, then purchase the original track or the London Music Works version for the same price.","5499":"ok","5500":"ok to sing to","5501":"ok to sing to","5502":"I have literally no complaints about this song. After hearing the song on YouTube, I felt like I needed to own a copy. Buying it was a breeze and now I'm introducing Black Violin to everyone I know. :)","5503":"great song by Robert Lamm, keyboard player and song writer for the group Chicago.","5504":"I love  traditional Gospel","5505":"there is nothing to dislike about the old gospel, true singing voices.  The words and beat simply amazing that me me just sing along, think about things and sometmes cry.  I wish I could give more stars","5506":"...#24, and kept the cd because Zacharias rarely ornaments in #24 and plays it as well as he can, at a B\/B- level I believe.  However, Leitner submits his third A+ #24 after five star versions with Kempff and Seemann, so that #24 deserves four stars overall.  I am guessing (only) that Leitner forbade CZ's customary intrusions. In #22 with Kord, though, he has free rein and,I believe, wrecks this great concerto (Mozart's third greatest after #s 24 and 25  I believe). The other movements are mutilated further. Both Brendel\/Marriner and Larrocha\/Segal and Davis employ ornamentation in their readings, and Brendel does very little of it in his fine version with Paul Angerer on Vox (see my review). However they are ascetic  compared to Zacharias. Of course\nthis is a subjective judgment, but even if the ornamentation here isn't annoying, other pianists perform the concerto\nmore effectively, including Brendel\/Marriner\/Philips, de Larrocha\/Segal\/Decca, Brendel\/Angerer\/Vox, Larrocha\/Davis\/RCA, Haebler\/Davis\/Philips, Kempff\/Klee\/DG, Annie Fischer\/Sawallisch\/EMI, Edwin Fischer\/EMI and Peter\nFrankl\/Szell\/You Tube.","5507":"It was a gift, but the receiver loved it!","5508":"I agree with the other reviewers regarding this set as a whole. I'll just add comments I made on a previous issue of ten of the symphonies on the Quadromania label in the middle of the last decade.\n\nErnest Bour conducts the SWF Radio Symphony Orchestra in ten Mozart symphonies, 25, 28, 29, 33, 35, 36, and 38-41. The recordings were done between 1964 and 1978, and released on Aurophon LPs. Membran licensed the tapes from Cascade, the owner, in 2004 for this set.\n\nI've listened to four of the symphonies, 25, 29, 35, and 39. The sound is dry and clear. Membran doesn't say when each work was recorded (another issue lists a recording date of January 1978 for 39 and 40), and they all clearly come from different sessions, but there's little difference between them. Bour's interpretations seem very straightforward in the best possible way. He doesn't dawdle in slow movements, he doesn't cover up wind and brass lines but he doesn't emphasize them, nothing sounds rushed.... it's hard to find something strikingly 'right' that Bour does, but that's because everything feels right as it is. I can hear the pitfalls he avoids, for example making the first movement of the Haffner ponderous - Bour's is 'crisp' like Szell, but warmer, less clipped. His 39 reminds me of Szell's as well, although gentler. (Szell was my \"imprint\" version, for what it's worth.) His 25 and 29 are good, and Bour avoids the temptation to be cloying in the latter symphony, but Marriner's early Phillips recordings get more out of these early works and are better recorded and played. Then again, Marriner's Academy Of St. Martins in the Fields is hardly \"big band\" Mozart, so it's not the best comparison to Bour.\n\nContinuing through the set, 40 receives a top-notch performance. 41, which I'm listening to now, is pretty good too, with some wonderfully hushed playing in the second movement. I've listened to 28, 40, 41, and 29 again since my initial comments, and my enthusiasm for this set grows. The sound is slightly boxy, but not to the point its annoying.\n\nCascade Media had a 40 CD Mozart box available a couple of years ago, which contained the Bour Symphonies from the Quadromania set and this X5 download, as well as the Magic Flute excerpts. I purchased that set for 20 bucks plus shipping, and if you can find it, get it, as it contains the Carmen Piazzini recordings of the piano concertos and piano sonatas, as well as a complete set of the violin concertos. This download is a good alternative if you can't get the Cascade set at a reasonable price.","5509":"This is a very good set of Mozart, and for the price is one of the best deals on Amazon's MP3 site. Germany's SWR (S&uuml;dwestrundfunk, or Southwestern Radio) Orchestra is a quality ensemble and the playing here is all very good to excellent.\n\nIt's refreshing that this isn't a \"best of Mozart\" set -- except for some \"Magic Flute\" excerpts, these are all full-length works. And although a number of very familiar pieces are included, such as the Sinfonia Concertante or the Jupiter Symphony, it is not a set of Mozart you've already heard a hundred times.\n\nI did hear an occasion or two where I thought some attacks were a little clumsy -- not intentionally fuzzy as in the Furtw&auml;ngler style, but just a bit muddled. But these were very few and far between and did not mar the set overall. While these are generally not performances that will beat the best out there, they are all highly competent and enjoyable. Very worthwhile as great music well played, and worth a very warm recommendation at the bargain price (right now $4.99, although I paid a little more).","5510":"Wow, what an absolute joy it was listening to this music.  The arrangements are really fresh, the musicians are really wonderful, and the lead singer has a very smooth, soulful and beautiful sound.  Love the lyrics.  Can't wait to hear more from Ms. Leigh.\n\nSunflower","5511":"I really like Sybreed, and I really like this specific song. It's really catchy and all around a great track. I love the vocal effects. I don't think the 3 remixes were really necessary, and if they were, they should have charged less for this EP. The remixes are all very similar in sound and feel: very heavily influenced by hip hop\/electronic music, with each remix having just some minor tweaks. I only ever listen to the original track","5512":"Do not think you are getting a cowboy poet, nothing could be further from the truth.","5513":"I wanted it in CD form.  I came as the supllier said it would.  Excellent variation in selection of songs.  Would recommend these CD's to anyone who likes smooth jazz","5514":"Great band.  Great music.  I ordered a used CD because I wasn't sure if I would like this group or not.  I was very pleased with my purchase.  The clarinet artist is awesome throughout. The CD was in excellent condition.","5515":"It did not download properly to my cell or pc!\nThanks , please help,\nDc","5516":"A CD of profound lyrics and soothing music to heal the soul. The songs speak of God's love and healing presence. Wanda's voice and the musical arrangements bring depth to the words.","5517":"most enjoyable selection of songs","5518":"Completing a collection of 'Angel Band' by various artists...just love this song & Porter does a nice job on it.","5519":"not good! everything is sung in Japanese & all the guitar notes are backwards! get the Chinese version instead, comes with a fortune cookie!","5520":"Well, I actually wrote the lyrics for one of the songs on this album, and I didn't find out till later that the 'producer' was even using it. Didn't even ask my permission at the time.","5521":"Awesome","5522":"Understand before you buy this that it is not the Cobalt 60 that Jean-Luc De Meyer is part of.  Though the CD is printed in Canada, the 'send info' address is in Boston.  Run-of-the-mill hard rock with its roots in the late 80's.","5523":"I love this song, could listen to it all day!

Absolutely!!!","5528":"I'm sure some like this song, it wasn't for me. My son is into sonic the hedgehog and music so i thought this was something we would be interested in,,,ooops","5529":"Every song on this album is catchy...I put this album on repeat! My two favorite songs are Heart-Inner Workings and Leaving Farrah. I can't wait for more releases from this group!!","5530":"This is one of the most moving songs and Bolton's voice just does it justice\nTake a listen  it great","5531":"This song is so beautiful, so inspirational, so encouraging.  It is one of the best duet songs of our day, and singing with Lara Fabian means the song will be golden.  The vocals are impressive for Bolton and Fabian, a song you can listen to again and again for many years to come.","5532":"For those moments of solitary enjoyent","5533":"It is one of 4 to make the 100... so only 25 in it. Not as advertised in my opinion.","5534":"Good music","5535":"The real thing. Truth.","5536":"I was not aware of the lyrical content, I deleted the song. I should have researched a little better and made a better choice.","5537":"The song was not Boom boom pow the Black eyed peas. I don't know what song it downloaded. Waist of money, had to song somewhere else.","5538":"Not the song I thought it was and don't care for the song.  Its not my taste of music.  Will delete from my music.","5539":"It's so odd hearing a famous, recognizable film star singing our hymns!","5540":"Powerful! please make more of these albums!","5541":"Well, cool sound, but its a creature growling, not a door slamming shut!","5542":"John Vanore has an ensemble called Abstract Truth that contains some of the more remarkable musicians before the public today.  This, his third album CONTAGIOUS WORDS, is just that - contagious.  Rarely has a big band ensemble demonstrated such cohesive communication while at the same time having each of the members be solo quality artists.  The album has eight remarkable tracks, six of them being compositions by John Dqvore and the other two are well known standards - 'You Go to My Head' and 'Neopolis'.\n\nThe performances are clean, well recorded and of the quality that burns on the mind long after each piece is played.  As Davore states 'It's all about storytelling - experiences that bring us deeper into understanding ourselves and those around us.  Music uniquely has the ability to touch us without the use of word or image...and in its abstract existence (the medium of sound) there is a truth in this means of conveying emotion and touching the spirit of the listener...CONTAGIOUS WORDS  collects many of these stories and experiences.'\n\nSo off and running is Abstract Truth with some of the most exciting 'big band' sounds around. The members are so important that they all deserve mentioning: John Davore, trumpet and flugelhorn, Michael Mee, alto an dsoprano sax and flute, Bob Howell, tenor and soprano sax\/bass clarinet\/flute, Joe Cataldo, Sean McAnally, Tony DeSantis, Bill Pusey, Kevin Rodgers - all on trumpet and flugelhorn, George Barnett, french horn, Fred  Scott and Larry Toft, trombone, Craig Thomas, acoustic and electric bass, Dan Monaghan, drums - with Ron Thomas, piano, Heather Fortune, flute, and Jim Daniels, bass trombone.  They are all stars, but the project that comes out to the listener is the gift of the very highly esteemed John Vanore.

Four of my absolute favorite hardcore bands! Thanks!","5545":"I love the idea of parody songs being covered. Or in some cases on this album, parodied. An uneven mix, the album contains 'Good Enough for Now' and 'Melanie,' two standouts which I enjoy in any format. An appropriate tribute to Al Yankovic should be, well, weird. Well done, Shael Riley and the Double Ice Backfire.","5546":"The acoustic version of this song  lacks forward momentum without the driving force of the bass line. What really turned me off was the sophomoric banter at the end which undermines the spirit of the song.  This version would have gotten more stars without the ad lib. I deleted the song.","5547":"This is an incredible display of songwriting, singing style and a gifted voice.  It is great to know that there are still singers who can carry the soulful torch of the greats such as Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight and Stephanie Mills.  I find myself playing this song several times a day.  Her talent must be in the genes!  Well, let's not overlook the significance of singing from the heart.\n\nDonnell White","5548":"The song is great, but playback is significantly distorted, particularly the percussion track in the background.  Have tried on a variety of devices and all show the same problem.  Perhaps the mp3 was encoded poorly.","5549":"I'm not a jazz connoisseur by any stretch of the imagination, but I do love great music and my collection stretches over many genres. Great music has a way of taking you places that mere words can't. This album is a shining example of that. It's magical in a way that it can take the frustration of the most hectic day and smooth it into a pillow of peace or it can play over a good meal and enhance the mindset of all the good things in life. Every collection should have this. I highly recommend it to all of my friends.","5550":"Something is wrong with this MP3... the last minute or two is scrambled, and is just digital noise.\n\nPLEASE FIX THIS, AMAZON!","5551":"Great cd!","5552":"Only to get the song Sunflower.","5553":"It was Ok! wish it was the longer mix.

I don't see the video or disc here at Amazon but maybe someday.","5556":"Volume II of the \"Desde La Cantina\" collection, is another great anthology to classic Mexican ballad style of \"Norteno\" music.

II include \"Flor de Capomo\" and \"Laurita Garza\". Flor the Capomo in particular is a cult classic and features vocalist Carlos Tierranegra from the legendary duo \"Carlos y Jose\"\nVolume II perhaps does not include as much depth as the initial Volume I release but still provides enough variety to make it a worthwhile add to the library.","5557":"This song is very well written and Bryan White does and excellent job in delivering it with great meaning.","5558":"Vocals are bad, Most are very strange arraignments that sound at best vaguely similar to original score. Would not recommend.","5559":"WireRose - From The End EP (Independent)\nCurrently causing a stir in their home state of Georgia, where their unsigned status is the source of considerable bewilderment, WireRose continue unfazed with the job in hand - making music. Their latest, the five-track \"From The End EP\" consolidates their ultra-hip modern rock sound, building upon 2009's \"Waiting\" album and securing their status as a band to look out for.\n\nThere's a hint of `epic' in what they do, in their lyrics and playing, the resulting sound might best be described as progressive, though we're talking the Radiohead \/ Mansun school of prog rather than the `70s version, with plenty of post-punk urgency, especially in the guitars, to dispel any thoughts of excess. Their scale is reflected in the length of their songs; the five tracks here spread out over 22 minutes, though there's hardly a second wasted.\n\nOpening track \"Trip Away\" is simultaneously effortless and abrasive, like classic psychedelia strained through a contemporary mesh. The title track dovetails `80s and `90s indie with right now, and again layers some wonderfully exciting guitar playing, the sort of thing that takes you back to the first time we heard Robert Smith or The Edge. \"Monster\" may lack a little of the intensity of other tracks but more than compensates with a chunky, choppy rhythm and the most insistent of choruses. If they're going to get on the radio, that's the one.","5560":"I've been searching for Dino's album, or any of his songs from his 24\/7 album and this is what I get.

Highly recommended - I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't listed here with Vol 3.\n\nVol. 3 is another good (but not great) compilation mixing album and live tracks from artists including Sarah McLachlan, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Alana Davis, Fastball and Barenaked Ladies. A few tracks are marked collector's edition including Fastball's \"The Way\" (acoustic) and Edwin McCain's \"Solitude.\" I'd give Volume Three 3 stars on it's own.","5563":"Poor sound quality","5564":"Fantastic version of this song! John Hammond is the man!","5565":"If you want to heard what is a nice latin jazz with a strong violin sound,  don't miss this.","5566":"Don't sleep!\nThis cat is nice....with heck of  a ear for production!!!","5567":"Love this song. It brings back old memories.","5568":"Eh","5569":"ex husband hacked into account and ordered them. No idea how it is working.","5570":"Way too melancholic and just no. Deleted. No style, no character, or personality, or something please?!","5571":"Got this as part of a free music sampler pack for participating in an Amazon survey somewhat recently, and was disappointed by its contents. This was one of them.","5572":"Like a cheap variation of Hope Sandoval & the Warm Inventions, Still Corners' `Endless Summer' comes of more boring and snooze-worthy than hypnotic and haunting.  The musicality seems stolen from better tracks and the whispered vocals don't emote the way that they should.  The song is trying desperately to encapsulate avant-garde but instead it feels pointless and insipid.  The song title also says a lot for the track itself, which comes across very long despite barely running over three minutes.  The lack of musical depth and the breathy vocals (which at times grate the eardrums) exasperate the track, making it feel as if it were running on and on.  It overstays its welcome rather quickly.\n\nI'm just glad this was free.","5573":"This is honestly really bad. Reminds me of Carlos Mencia mixed with Carrot Top.","5574":"Someone needs to talk to Cuck Metzger about how unfunny he is","5575":"The title of this is very misleading. I sat my daughter down to watch this film to gain an insight on sex. She later became a pill addict, got pregnant, and then shot herself. I really regret this purchase.","5576":"Love this guy and his humor and if you are not sure please sample his bits from tv or any where else.","5577":"This is a dreamy and haunting single album with an underlying feeling of tension.  Both songs are great and they leave me wanting more.  The music beckons from an obsessed mind while bending my mood like a minor chord.  Playing this over and over drifts me into a relaxing oblivion.  Balanced notes fall easy on the ears.  Not too dark, but I hear a calling.  The cover is harsh though the sounds melt like colored rain drops in slow motion.  A splash of love.  A pleasant surprise.","5578":"Very happy with my purchase.","5579":"An infectious tune that showcases O'Regan's talent as an artist.  It is a pleasure to hear fun electro-pop rock songs from DR instead of the mainstream bs that unfortunately wins recognition, sales and even Grammys.  Thanks John, for making music we enjoy!","5580":"Don't waste your money.  Although 'Banjo Special' is pictured, it is actually 'Banjoist' that is being sold. Don't get me wrong, 'Banjoist' is a wonderful CD and makes an excellent introduction to Buddy's Music.","5581":"This guy is so talented! I can't stop listening to his vocals. In a world of manufactured pop he really stands out for his originality. Plus, his songs are really fun! Can't wait for him to release more albums.","5582":"This song is definitely an example of perfection in its original form. To alter it would be (and was) blasphemy.","5583":"One of my favorite tango song.\nLove to dance with this song.\nAmazon player is not good. I downloaded the MP3 and put it on iPhone - it is great since","5584":"Very talented pianist, and for that the two stars were awarded.  The title is very misleading, however.  This is a classical album with jazz as played by a classical pianist.  Technique is marvelous, but jazz is absent.  If you love listening to classical piano and do not already have the selections on this album, you will enjoy it.  If you were hoping for a fresh new Jazz holiday CD, you will be greatly disappointed.","5585":"When I heard this while watching Madoka Magica I decided I loved it. It has a lof of interesting chord progressions sounds kinda sad and tense. It's a beautiful song.","5586":"Jeff Bates sounds so much like Conway Twitty, I like listening to everything he does.  He sounds so much like conway","5587":"Never heard of Nicki Minaj until I heard this song.\nGetting overplayed.","5588":"Love it","5589":"mad Bass!  ;)","5590":"Kalafina us amazing Japanese girl group that I love. When I heard Lacrimosa in Black Butler.  I had to have it. This song is amazing as my favorite show is Black Butler.  The killed it for the ending song.","5591":"I am very happy with the CD. I knew the artist personally many years ago, on the West Coast and I always enjoyed his music. The CD is inspirational and many of the songs have very special and prayerful messages. Very heartwarming,  I will recommend  this CD  to my friends!!!!!!.","5592":"Love this song","5593":"This was an MP3 download and was exactly what I was looking for. Great song & he has a great voice!","5594":"This was an MP3 download and it was exactly what I was looking for in a purchase. Love the song.","5595":"it's important to know the reissue of de la soul is dead on vinyl DOES NOT include 2 great songs, \"my brother's a basehead\" and \"afro connections...\", as well as the kicked out the house skit.  they were kept off to save money so the entire album could fit on 1 LP.  this is an incredible album and it bothers me it would be reissued with 2 songs cut.","5596":"There is nothing about this song that isn't beautiful and perfect.","5597":"Album cover rougher than expected.","5598":"Ended up not using this.  Had a better CD from a friend that we used.","5599":"I regret this purchase and DO NOT RECOMMEND. After buying This I found out there is an app for way less $ that is 100x better. This app tricked us into a few tourist traps, it had us turning around multiple times trying to find an obscure place that wasn't as great as other places. It is outdated and full of advertisements for places along the way. This cd made our trip a lot less amazing than it could have been, and is one of my only regrets about my trip to Maui","5600":"I like this tack. Took me a minute to find out the name, saw the video on BETJams channel","5601":"I really want these songs I should have gone to itunes I will never puchase music here again I xepect a refund","5602":"This song goes way too hard. I love the beat and the way Big Sean's voice sounds while he raps","5603":"Great song ! Instant classic","5604":"Thought I was getting a \"Best Of\" and didn't bother previewing the songs. These are all re-recorded versions of the songs that sound nothing like the original. They all sound like they've been disco-ized. Buyer beware!","5605":"Great download quality.","5606":"I DIDN'T ORDER THIS SONG!!!!! I PURCHASED MARVIN GAYE & CHARDONNAY.BUT YOU GAVE ME A SONG I ALREADY HAVE. WTF!!!!!!???????","5607":"I was really excited to get a few pregnancy meditation cd's.  I wish I had realized how short this one was before I spent $8.99 to buy the MP3's!  It is ok for a short meditation but if you are looking for something that lasts longer, skip this one! If you have any experience with guided meditation, I do not recommend this cd, it just doesn't have enough substance.","5608":"Liszt was possibly the great piano virtuoso of his day, in an era where technique was under constant exploration by the best of the best. Every technique that his rivals singly mastered, Liszt mastered as well. He was a rock star of the day's concerts, and the fact that there was no way to record his performances for later years leaves a hole in the universe.\n\nWe can, however, imagine the skill he displayed in performance by gauging the demands of his compositions. And his compositions are voluminous and filled with constant delights.\n\nHere we have 34 CDs full, a treasure trove of masterful performances of one of the brightest stars to ever shine on the field of piano composition. Hours of pleasure.","5609":"This is a great band, FINGERS CROSSED is one of my favorite songs of all time.","5610":"Excellent...I'm huge fan so I'm a tad bit biased....on the other hand the album was well done...excellent quality love, loved this!!! Thank you Doris for your gifts. Thank you Amazon!","5611":"Supposed to be clean version.  It is not.","5612":"great condition....for being so old...","5613":"I listened to this track about 6 times and it was 6 times too many. This nobody trying to get paid by dissin Hova! The hook is weak as is his attempt to steal the beat. This guy need to be put 6 feet under! Jay-Z is tha MAN! I haven't seen anyone besides Dr. Dre and Jay-Z be this influential in the game. Now you can put Eminem and 50 Cent in that category, but this was a complete waste of time to listen to. He only did it so he can try to sell records. He must not reallize that Hova has millions of fans worldwide that won't buy his garbage. Jada and 50 had a fun beef going with two talented spitters. This guy sux!","5614":"Not sure I how I got this in my playlist, but I like it.  Good KROQ kind of song.  Anthemy rock with a smidgen of understated pop.  I don't get sick of hearing it on my iPod.","5615":"good music.","5616":"I would recommend this songs to all of my friends. This song has been one of my all time favorites ever since i heard it.","5617":"This is a great song by a great band! I would love to see them in concert when and if they ever come to town! ;)","5618":"song","5619":"Great","5620":"It's Tom Scott, silly.","5621":"This is the first Earle song I'd heard. A good introduction thus far.","5622":"While converting part of my late uncle's collection of LPs to CD, I found Ernie's LP recording of Civil War Sngs of the North. One listen convinced me I had to have the companion recording of Songs of the South.  I was not disappointed.  These are truly outstanding albums in every way; song selection, performance, arrangements, and technical quality.  A a life long audio geek since the 50's I know of what I speak and these recordings by Capitol, released in 1961 cannot be beat.  BTW, the vinyl LP digital conversion and the MP3 download are esentially of equal quality.  Totally satisfied!","5623":"I like to purchase the complete cd not just this song","5624":"Nice picture vinyl, thanks.","5625":"This was not a 4-song record (Extender Play) as stated in posting, It was a single, one song each side.","5626":"I got to see them in concert in Auburn Indiana. Great band to listen to and to rock out to.","5627":"I love the group Pop Evil.  They have some really serious killer tunes.  I'm really picky and it has to rock and rock hard.  This group and this song fits the bill.","5628":"Perfect!!!!!","5629":"This was of course a unique situation, with Bernstein conducting Cav of all things. Those who complained that he was out of his element here had better check the score. By dusting off many traditional cobwebs, he brought this to life as if it were a new work he was trying to promote. Domingo had previously been scheduled for this production, but the labor problems which so delayed the '69, '70 season produced various temporary defections, including the young Spaniard's. Corelli took over, and did he take over! At that time, young Domingo could never have approached Corelli in this one, particularly in this form and cooperating fully with Bernstein. There's no doubt who's in charge, but Corelli much more than makes up for his relatively sloppy performance on his commercial set of Cav, where his scooping seriously mars the \"Addio\". This time, he delivers the best Turiddu I have ever heard. The Operatic Ear, anotheramerica.org","5630":"It is OK. It is too fast for me.\nI wish I could give it back because I have one that is better.","5631":"Pop Evil is a great band with a great energy. I have been so happy by most all of their songs.","5632":"I'm a little bit late to pick up on Pop Evil....but now that I've heard them, I'm sure they will be around for a good long time.  Solid rock riffs.","5633":"If you got here from the Putumayo:Africa link, be forewarned this is not the correct record.","5634":"This is an excellent song. It was very easy to purchase and download to my Kindle. Makes me comfortable ordering more.","5635":"needed it","5636":"love it","5637":"I like the monster","5638":"I love Bad Lip Reading, and this song never fails to crack me up. Also, congrats Amazon on dropping the DRM from your music!","5639":"My husband song he loved being in the Navy","5640":"My brother-in-Law was in the Navy, so I applied this ringtone to his and my sister's numbers, which makes it easier to identify who is calling without checking my phone.","5641":"Can't go wrong with a good navy song!  I used this song in a video rendition of my son entering the navy.....","5642":"love her voice","5643":"ex husband hacked into account and ordered them. No idea how it is working.","5644":"Smooth!","5645":"Great voice","5646":"The Great Romance is such a talented group of musicians and this is a great song! Great beat with beautiful lyrics.","5647":"This version of the song sounds like it was recorded in my friends garage studio.  Very hollow and echo'y (word?).  I would recommend waiting for her real album to come out. The AI version doesn't sound very good.","5648":"Thank you.","5649":"This is a great cd and I would highly recommend it to anyone who just loves all music genres.","5650":"LIke it.","5651":"A few minutes for .99 cents...what should I expect?","5652":"The guitar playing was to fast. They did not hold the notes the right length. Not good. Wish I did not buy","5653":"He is so talented. I listen to this song all the time. You should definitely buy it! You will love listening to him!","5654":"\"Classical Gas\" is an instrumental musical piece composed and originally performed by Mason Williams. Originally released in 1968 on the album The Mason Williams Phonograph Record.\nThere is a common misconception that \"Classical Gas\" was composed and performed by Eric Clapton. Clapton has never recorded a cover of the song. This misconception may possibly be attributed to the fact that Clapton was musical director of, and played much of the guitar music for, the feature film The Story of Us. The version of the song on the film's soundtrack is actually Williams's own solo-guitar re-recording of it, from his 1970 album Handmade.","5655":"so many great versions of the song, and this one is the worst I have heard yet.","5656":"This song is great.  THere is a continual beat going on that carries you along with Peter Bradley Adams voice and lyrics that also carry you.\nThe song is a journey in itself and it will take you to another dimension where you will feel more peaceful and find beauty and wisdom.  Peter Bradley Adams songs are amazing and insightful, and the music just takes you away.  Great lyrics, Great music, Great voice. Great Talent.","5657":"not my kind of music","5658":"ex husband hacked into account and ordered them. No idea how it is working.","5659":"A great song by a great classic rock band ...add this to your collection as well as, \"do you feel,\" and people will be impressed.","5660":"ex husband hacked into account and ordered them. No idea how it is working.","5661":"Not for guitarist Justin Johnson fans - Bad Techno","5662":"Not a very good cd","5663":"This is very strange re-issue I've ever seen.\nPoor LP miniature sleeve is made in Korea, Media Arte and the disc is made in ....\nThere's no country of release and record association.\nOf course, no license at all.\nBeware! This is pirate boot issue.\nSound quality? Don't even think about it!","5664":"Live performance and not good quality recording....would not have bought if I would have know. Wish I would selected another to have had the original recording","5665":"The song is actually a fun history lesson for horse lovers.  More importantly, as a bluegrass music fan who is totally in love with the banjo, I hope Steve Martin's involvement can increase awareness of this art form and bring Bluegrass more into the mainstream.","5666":"Great song!","5667":":D","5668":"james levine's performances of scott joplin are just okay. i'm not a fan of the tempos he uses or the lack of expression of the syncopation on this cassette.  I prefer dick hyman's performances because they are much more enthusiastic.","5669":"She likes Selena Gomez a lot, and this is one of her favorite songs.  Great, great sound!  The thing is that you have to download Amazon downloader, and once you have done it, it doesn't work, so I had to download the song manually.  Without Amazon downloader, you have to go song by song.","5670":"Really nice when she sings the slow parts. I think Selena is deeper than people give her credit for being.","5671":"song","5672":"I like this song. It's about going crazy in the nights where there's no one but your friends around and the day is over. Love it!","5673":"I didn't realize it was a \"live\" version, otherwise I wouldn't have bought it. I previewed it under the individual song listing and it sounded ok. The full version is terrible. I would like to take replace this with the real version, but without being able to preview the full song, I won't take any chances.","5674":"My Daughter loves the Fresh Beats so this song really gets her dancing. I cant wait to buy more of their songs","5675":"Not original artists.","5676":"Why would you make an album with non-original artists?  Not worth the money. Why doesn't Amazon have a button for music like they do for books? \"Accidentally purchased \"","5677":"It's great. Period. It's Prince doing what he did best back in the 80's, making good time music that makes you want to dance.","5678":"That's all. 18 more words required18 more words required18 more words required18 more words required18 more words required18 more words required","5679":"Greatest alive. World Boss. Special!!","5680":"was not what I was hoping for - do not care for his singing","5681":"The title of the song describes it song perfectly.","5682":"For newcomers: This is software-made music (synthetic) mostly made in Japan since 2007. Its fans normally are also fans of Japanese anime and culture. The blue hair girl on cover is Hatsune Miku, the most popular of these virtual singers and a real diva in Japan!\n\nThis trance and electronic songs has some energy and keeps Hatsune Miku's and Clean Clear in good standing for us, Miku fans!","5683":"My favorite aria and an interesting rendition y the artist.","5684":"Theory of a Deadman continues to put out great work.  This song is now on the top of my list!","5685":"Really enjoy Moncayo's Huapango. I bought several different versions of it, loved listening to all of them before I purchased.","5686":"The Treacherous Three: SPECIAL K, SUNSHINE, and KOOL MOE DEE. This is OLD SCHOOL RAP BABY. When Rap Music was fun, innovative and about something. Not a control mechanism used to hinder the creative juices of the new generation, and  on that killing, gangster rap crap. When I look at COOL MOE DEE on the cover of this album, I giggle (he's so skinny). This was before he started wearing the uniforms and big shades. Takes you back to the days of Mr. Magic, and Uncle Ralph (Video Music Box). When you know the rap game and you're down with The Old School, you're not down with the New Fools. We love the conscious, innovative rap records that paved the way, rap records that sounds good (old and new)and take us back in the day. Peace.","5687":"Funny song","5688":"a","5689":"wonderful song, a real rocker","5690":"Love here voice and music - annoying though one must pay for all her stuff! But anyway this specific tune is a fav!","5691":"I should have paid more attention. It's a DEMO not an actual performance track. SO disappointed!","5692":"Well done. It's easy to follow.","5693":"This is only a demo, not a performance track...","5694":"This is a Zumba song that was pretty hard to locate. Love it.","5695":"The instrumental tracks on this album were great.  It is hard to find \"instrumentals\" without anyone singing a bunch of words. The mp3 format was easy to use.","5696":"I love the official video for this song that Brandon Rhyder did, but this version isn't very good.","5697":"It was delivered on time. The music is wonderful!","5698":"The 45 was almost new condition was in jacket with original studio logo, gave it a spin on the old record player really good quality.\nCaptain Howdy is a demon mentioned in the original Exorcist by Lindas Blairs character . Sometimes there is a thrill that clicks with an activity and people are drawn in and hooked on unwholsome things. Some of this is spiritual.  A Wholesome life is just damage control, bad things are gonna get ya sooner or later. Demons want you discredited , destroyed and dead before you you can find Jesus.\nI bought this 45 to help \"Demonstrate\" the point to some youngsters in and around my life. It is collectable rock and roll and some of my daughters friends seem to like that and I can use it to make a point about how easy it is to invite things in that will destroy your life.  Earth is a self cleaning oven continually remaking its self through corruption. Salvation and purity through Jesus only.","5699":"Mattie Montgomery is a voice crying out in this generation. A generation that is dying to sexual immortality, greed, idolatry, suicide, etc.\n\nThis album (and book) is a powerful piece of spoken word that will awaken spirits for a revolution.\n\nGet it.","5700":"I'm not much of a volcaloid person but I absolutely love this song. Wish people make more tracks like this.","5701":"Fantastic","5702":"These guys are good but do like the new version of the group better.","5703":"Somebody had posted all of these songs on youtube as the \"Official Soundtrack to Prometheus.\" While not true, it was a great find. This album is so smart.","5704":"Good music but depicting God as a female is too objectionable for me.  I like a lot of Josh's works.  I can not recommend this one.","5705":"Best music of CARLOS Y JOSE...","5706":"nice song to listen to at any time.. =)","5707":"Excellent job yea good on songs but I was disappointed on galaxy tab charger I was sent the wrong one","5708":"I did not like the remix, I like the original song","5709":"I love tucka!!!","5710":"love the song......great condition","5711":"The dance floor loved it.  However, from a quality of audio standpoint, it lacks tremendously.  Whatever happened to non-compressed files?  Nothing against the orchestra that recorded this but I am certain they do not hear all of their playing the way they thought it would be heard.","5712":"TapWater - Too Dark To Blink (Independent)\nTapWater are a six-piece Americana group based in Portland, Oregon, slowly but surely building their reputation through a series of well received releases and a busy concert schedule. Such is their growing status, their latest album, \"Too Dark To Blink\" has attracted various high profile guest turns, including several members of Los Lobos. Indeed, Steve Berlin produces and plays saxophone and melotron. Not two instruments that are naturally associated with an Americana band, but when you consider that frontman Rudy Slizewski also contributes steel drums, xylophone, trombone and marimba, and other listed instruments include lap harp and flugelhorn, it's probably best to chuck those stereotypical expectations out of the window.\n\nThanks to Berlin's production (and the band's experience) it's somewhat remarkable that \"Too Dark To Blink\" doesn't ever feel cluttered or clumsy. The sound is full and rounded, and the variety of instruments is beautifully judged. When the steel drum makes an appearance on \"Drownin' Without Love\" it's a genuine moment of joy, and they repeat the trick on \"See Ya Maria\", though it's mixed gently with lead guitar. Tracks like \"Frankie Leigh\" and \"Big Belly Blues\" make comparisons with early Wilco and The Band fully justified and the short but very serious, almost classical, \"With My Curtains Closed\" indicates a band willing to take on anything, and able enough to prevail. Recommended.","5713":"One of your reviewers compared it to water boarding I agree and hope the CIA uses it along with a video of rappers on mute and this as the music track. Confusing?\nI gave it a one because I had to do something,right now I'm taking that one star back.","5714":"I concur with the previous review. Based on the sample its simply a repeating beat.. should get a lot of downloads from Guantanamo Bay though as it is a great alternative to water-boarding.","5715":"Maybe if I actually knew Federico Aubele's \"Bohemian Rhapsody in Blue,\" the song of which this is a remix, I would be able to appreciate this - but somehow I don't think so.  This remix consists of the same beat played over and over throughout, with some occasional other sounds in the background, and the same two snippets of vocals repeated in a faintly appealing arrangement that becomes tedious long, long before the three and a half minutes of this track are up.  I haven't known many folks who could manage to carry a tune while mumbling indifferently, but that seems to be Aubele's style.  Unless you're that persistent eccentric who has taken it as her personal mission to review the Amazon Free MP3 of the Day every day (and, lest there be any confusion in this regard, you're not), I can't think of a single good reason to listen to this dull exercise in cut-and-paste.","5716":"UK Hip hops most under-rated MC.  His new album Constant Dikestar is even better too.  GET THIS NOW!  He also has another new album due out by the end of 2012 so lookout.","5717":"I don't remember this song, so it probably sucks.","5718":"Didn't care for it.","5719":"I love tucka's music","5720":"Excellent!","5721":"didn't like mp3 version. ordered CD instead","5722":"With the computer generated mono-tone voice, you couldn't fall asleep faster reading it yourself. I thought it would be great, but poorly put together. The person in charge of this project has little to no real personal recovery. If they say they do ~ well we all know what being Dry is all about","5723":"These recordings are done with a computer generated voice that is not easy to listen to. I would not recommend purchasing this item.","5724":"DO NOT BUY the MP3.....I have tried 2 different music sites and the track just stops about mid way through.....Look else where....","5725":"I misread the add and did not know it was albums ans returned the item.","5726":"Another song I'd never heard before my mom chose it for her memorial service.  Full of hope and faith.","5727":"Shelbey has a wonderful voice. That is a beautiful rendition on John Ylvisaker's \"I Was There To Hear Your Borning Cry.\"  We have sung this hymn at our Lutheran Church for many years at baptisms, weddings, and funerals. Every time I hear it, it brings tears to my eyes. I disagree that it is too fast. She used the early version of the song. \"When you find someone...\"  was replaced by \"IF you find someone\". I will be listening to other cuts on her albums to download.","5728":"Was recommended as a good song, but although Ms Picek has a beautiful voice, it was wasted on that song. Listen to the preview before you spend money on this one.","5729":"Do not buy the track \"Do You Know The Way To San Jose\"...it stops midway through the track....","5730":"While I appreciate the attempt to recreate the song and all its ambiance, the vocalist just is not strong enough to pull off this song.  The underlying music is fairly accurately recreated, But with todays electronics that is to be expected.  What sets Enigma's music apart is their strong haunting vocals, expertly mixed and balanced with the music.\nSadly this just doesn't cut it.  Do yourself a favor and just download the real thing, listen to both and you will see just how pale this is in comparison.","5731":"There are no words to expalin this song...just simply wonderful, Praise GOD for the words of this song!!!!! a must get!","5732":"Not the original artist, these are other artists performing the songs and they sound horrible. Very misleading. If I wanted to hear a fake version I could've had my kids sing it for free. Not worth the money.","5733":"No NO NO NO NO. Mickey can do so much better than this. The hip hop Life is a Highway hurts to hear.  Somebody please get Mickey something to sing worthy of his voice.","5734":"I want to start by making one thing clear: Mickey Thomas is one of my all time favourite male rock vocalists and I love his work with Starship.\n\nSo, it's with a heavy heart I write this review. This is simly put a terrible album. His voice sounds great, but I don't want to hear an album with covers. The worst song without a doubt is the Hip Hop mix version of \"Life is a Highway\", closely followed by \"Money Talks\". No, no and NO. \"Hollywood Nights\" is the only song i find OK.\n\nI would love to see someone provide him with new melodic rock songs and make an album that makes his great voice justice. Come on Mickey, you can do better than this!","5735":"This is the greatest CD As always!! From my great friend Mickey Thomas!! This music takes me back to the 80's When I hear all his great songs!!! Mickey is the voice of a lot of major hits, I will always love his music and will cherish his friendship in the future years to come!!! This CD is in everyway the best!! Take a listen to the samples and you will see why his voice is the magic behind Jefferson Starship and Starship!!

Buy them all.  And buy their kid's album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Cake-for-Dinner\/dp\/B003VR889O\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cake for Dinner<\/a>&nbsp;(an album I listen to even when the kids are not around).  These guys have amazing talent and the ability to blend rock, folk, Irish-, Gypsy-, and Slavic- styles of music, with a wonderful blend of original pieces and classic favorites.  I first met them when they performed at my Alma Mater while they were in the area for an Irish Festival, and I've been hooked ever since.  Not since a good decade ago when I was in high school has a band earned such a coveted and nearly unmoved spot in my CD player!","5737":"First.  I don't write many musical reviews.  I prefer to spend my time either playing or listening.  Second.  A disclaimer: Yes I am A BW fan; however, I have not been shy about expressing my honest opinion about his various projects.  That said, I love these tracks.  I have always wondered what BW would sound like playing straight-ahead Jazz.  I can still hear elements of the \"Parliament days\" sound.  Those weird \"irks and quirks\" that are BW signatures.  As a matter of fact, I was expecting an all acoustic CD, but was surprised to hear those vintage electronic keyboard sounds.  My favorites are his versions of Take 5, and Watermelon Man. Both stick fairly close to the original melodies, but they are definitely BWs interpretation of the tunes.  I boil things down simply:  Would Herbie Hancock like BW's version of Watermelon Man?  I bet so.  Would Dave Brubeck like \"Take 5?\"  I bet.  Antonio Carlos Jobim would appreciate \"Agua de Beber\" ... and so on.  BW's whimsical approach to music reminds me of another one of my heroes: Thelonious Monk.  Both men seem to just hear what they hear, and play what they play.  So I'm thrilled BW is taking a minute to play Jazz.\n\nRespectfully Submitted;\n\nWTG","5738":"OK, it's official: I'm old. I MUST be old; all these people who were the firebrands of my youth are making these discs\/records\/recordings - whatever you call them nowadays - where they show that they are \"mature\" in some sort of way. What way is demonstrated on this one? Well, none really - if you judge it by the way it sounds. But Jazz, as a signifier, represents something like \"a more advanced, more reflexive musicianship\". I call BS - really! This is a Jazz record the way hearing the theme of Blowin' In The Wind over Muzak in a supermarket is Rock. The only thing that remains from the brilliance that Mr. Worrell demonstrated in the past is an enormous sensitivity to the vast tonal and emotional palette that \"keyboards\" are capable of - he really changed that game, especially in terms of how Pop producers used those instruments. This is audible here, for example, on You're My Thrill where both subtle and not - so - subtle shifts of vibrato function somewhat as they do in the tenor sax playing of a Ben Webster. There are some little pleasures like this to be found here. But they are far and few between. Most of the time, there is a plodding repetition of themes, toneless wanking substituting for improvisation...all of this accompanied by a crack team of top level Downtown New York Freelancers who were, I'm sure, constantly high - fiving each other in the studio between takes, telling each other how \"killing these tracks are\". Well, you can sleep the sleep of the just, henchmen; you did the best that you could do, given the dire circumstances. And, publicist, too, you did your job - NPR profile about how aging Funkmeister goes back to his Jazz roots, etc.,etc., ad nauseum, blah, blah, blah...It's not your fault either. Is it Bernie's fault? I don't want to denigrate the man who added so much genius to Flashlight, Funkentelechy, Chocolate City and so many other Funk Masterpieces. I'd rather just call it - sad. Weak and sad.","5739":"Rahsaan Patterson is phenomenal.. this is a must have for your music collection ..","5740":"This one I discovered through Bob Parlocha's list, and being a big band fan I had to give it a chance. In this recording the Gran Canaria Big Band pays homage to Broadway musicals with a unique big band sound - with several Gershwin musicals, and to the Count Basie Big Band.  I really enjoyed Laura Sim's singing, with lots of feeling and energy. Fawncy meeting you here and S'Wonderful are two of the highlights. These musicians really know what they are doing, just listen to the solos and big band unison in Spanky and really come out swinging full of energy. The Broadway touch and Laura Sim's singing really set it apart from many other big band recordings.","5741":"Do not purchase  this song it has a big voice over announcement halfway through the  song saying  this copy is for review  only i lost a doller thats a pp cent cheese burger","5742":"Obviously the soundtrack to the great Ilomilo Xbox live game.  The game was quirky and colorful and the soundtrack was just the same.  Fun and quirky music that you can just hear a story in.  I've played selected tracks at a friend's baby shower and will be playing a few tracks at my wedding this year as well!","5743":"Package presented was supposed to be \"A Flor de Piel\" but product was \"20 Boleros de Siempre\".  Very disappointed with this purchase.  Cannot comment on desired product as it did not arrive in its packaging.","5744":"Great, anointed talent!","5745":"So I just got back from the Midwest Banjo Camp and heard Mabus play this song during the staff concert.  He had us spellbound.  It was the highlight of the night. It ran close to 8 minutes I think and I would have been happy if he doubled that. What Mabus shows is that a few simple phrases are more powerfull than a wall of notes. Now he certainly played around with the standard melody but he was never unfair to it.  Well done Mabus.","5746":"I DJ at a large nightclub, this song was a request, ok but not my style - to slow for me","5747":"AWESOME MUSIC.  I have no idea why this music was never out there.  They are ridiculously good.  They remind me of Sevendust in an alternate universe. lol","5748":"Fantastic!  I only wish I could get a printoutof the lyrics.","5749":"It took me years to find this music from the Lullabye Lady.  There has never been better music for children and I was thrilled to be able to buy it at any price.","5750":"These Devaraja - Khmer empire songs do not have anything to do with Khmer music at all.  I preview the songs and they sounds more like some sort of head banger heavy metal with really loud distorted noise that you can't understand anything.  Maybe it is a mistake of the seller to upload the wrong files.  No Khmer words, not Khmer music, - no buy. Do do buy any of these thinking it's Khmer music.","5751":"Cant get it to play","5752":"Excellent beautiful voice","5753":"Out of all the CD's I've ordered from Amazon, there was only 1 song on here that was truly worth keeping. The rest I was completely disappointed with and should have just bought and downloaded that one song.","5754":"Cool jazz, I like it","5755":"I don't have it. I paid for the song but don't know where it is. I paid but can not listen to the music.","5756":"I prefer this version. The original is good too but this is much more melodious( no pun intended). The choir and I think the piano or whatever instrument that is giving off that funky tune. I really like it","5757":"I caught a snippet of this tune in the car and it sounded okay, so I bought it (actually, I think it was free).  It makes me think of those packs of ditzy junior-high girls who got mommy to dump them at the mall for the afternoon...kinda mindless and boring and empty and a little annoying.  It feels machine-generated (sometimes I think popular music is being written by software nowadays and this is a good example of that).  This would be suitable for inclusion on a playlist belonging to one of the aforementioned ditzy junior-high-schoolers.  (Disclaimer: grumpy old man here, way out of the demographic this was intended for.)","5758":"Great music from the 50's.","5759":"love it.","5760":"I love it.  It is great for studying or relaxing.  It mellows me out and prevents me from getting aggrverated","5761":"Was not able to download music after following all directions, also could not get online help. Regardless of pricing, if you can't get a product, it's worthless.","5762":"If you like FREE, Bad Company, or Paul Rodgers generally, you simply cannot go wrong with this dvd. Paul remains arguably the finest rock singer of all time, and is in quite excellent form here. Guest appearances abound, but in a good way! Yet squarely the attention lies on Rodgers, in terms of his palpable singing and rocking ability. Tremendous. Buy it.","5763":"Not nearly as good as the rest of the album.  They could have released the whole album without this and the only thing that would be negatively effected would be the mention of \"Glitter Freeze\" in the song \"Broken\".","5764":"what's not to love about this","5765":"What??? Someone took a vinyl recording and just plopped it up here on Amazon.com expecting, I don't know what. If you want to experience the \"joy\" of listening to a bad record player playing a worn and scratched album... this is your ticket to heaven. Seriously. The performance may have been fine live. But there is distortion, pops AND skips in the recording. I could go on... but there is not much more to say. Don't purchase this dog (even if you like dogs).","5766":"There just aren't many good duck hunting song out there and this is one of them!  Would recommend to all those duck hunters out there!","5767":"They never disappoint.","5768":"The audio quality is terrible; there are frequent skips and glitches in the MP3, which are not present on the CD. Save your money and avoid this MP3 download like the plague.","5769":"Warning: I recommend you avoid this.  This set of mp3 files is of unusually poor quality for an Amazon download (this is the first time I've ever written a review like this).  The background to all the pieces is full of scratches and it sounds like these were transferred from a record to mp3 files without cleanup.  And the Ravel La Valse mp3 file starts with the ending bars of the Dukas Sorcerer's Apprentice, then a blank gap, and then the Ravel starts more than half a minute into the file.\n\nIf anybody at Amazon reads this, I'd like my money back please, even if it was only $3.56.","5770":"La Mer is obviously from a very noisy LP, and the Dukas ends before the coda.\nA very sloppy, inferior product.\nI wish someone would put out high quality CDs of Ansermet at a reasonable price.","5771":"Half songs not very happy with this cd at all","5772":"I came across this album and I just find it to be weird. I'm a hardcore Eminem fan and never heard of this. This isn't underground or anything. What's weird is there's no editorial reviews or customer reviews. The album seems to have songs I never heard of. No mp3s for the songs either. It says that it came out in july 2011. But he never made anything in 2011 solo especially since he dropped hell the sequel less than a month earlier to when this is supposedly released. I would not buy this because most likely it's a scam","5773":"Typically great Anne Murray music. Very uplifting.","5774":"Serious brass players should have this one.","5775":"This MIGHT be a nice way to introduce Louis Armstrong, New Orleans and 20s jazz to new audiences, but for us old school jazz fans,\ndigitally re-recording of Louis Armstrong classic sides\nseems quite counterintuitive (in many respects it's hardly jazz at all when you try to copy old recordings).\n\nFor me this will be, at best, a background CD, in spite of all the respectable musical and technological effort put into this project.\n\nIt just doesn't seem right (and putting original and new but not-really-magnificent vocals in the middle of the recreations doesn't really help either).","5776":"Soulful and sexy-  Elizabeth Rose's evocative voice and style is reminiscent of Tori Amos.  But where Tori lost me years ago with being repetitive and uninspired, Rose continues to produce stirring, frequently weird (in a good way) songs.","5777":"Often there are short clips of artist music on Adult Swim. It's sad that the entire song cannot be heard. I wasted money on this track as most of it is complete garbage in it's entirety. Because this is a digital purchase, one is stuck with it and the money cannot be refunded. Much like all other music purchases. Not pleased in the least! Total garbage","5778":"Finally, many of the traditional marches NOT remastered and sounding like they were recorded in a tin bucket.  Never heard of the orchestra before today, but the recordings are professional.  A number of non-marches in there, but they are great pieces, too.  For this price one can get them all and not feel cheated by pulling out half a dozen favorites and never listening to the rest.  But no not me!  Once upon a generation or so ago I was in a a marching band, and this genre of music still stirs me.  No tin bucket music in this album!","5779":"not what I expected.","5780":"The quality of the recordings and arrangements are inconsistent and many of the songs are not \"favorites.\"  This album features several songs that I had never even heard of before!  Despite this, it is an okay purchase for the price and worth having to use as \"fill-in\" music at patriotic events.","5781":"The song is not a Godly song, it makes you think its Godly song with its title. But I looked the lyrics. Want nothing to do with it.","5782":"I have loved John Farnham since the late 80\"s.  This version is a bit different from the original... but still true to the original.","5783":"A must-hear song for peace","5784":"Heard this on youtube with the 2 Merlin stars singing it and immediately loved it and their funny rendition of it...also like the words and catchy tune, so I bought the song.","5785":"Didn't care for it.","5786":"I was sample new music for my collection and did not find this appealing.  Simply not my cup of tea.","5787":"I don't remember this song, so it probably sucks.","5788":"If you're into the roots-rock kind of thing, you might like this.  It sounds sort of like a wild punker such as a higher-voiced, Stooges-era Iggy Pop fronting the Stray Cats.  There are brief & loose sax & electric guitar solos.  For me, though, roots-rock has to be more polished than this, more like Dave Alvin or something like that (even John Doe).  This Dex song is too buzz-saw, too wildly sung, too rough around the edges... (etc.)","5789":"nice arrangement of voices as well.","5790":"not my kind of music","5791":"This is not the original... and it is horrible.","5792":"CAREFUL WITH THIS QUALITY OF DOWNLOAD - NOT THE BEST VERY LOW VOLUME AND RANGE ON THIS EDITION OF MP3.","5793":"While I like the beat to this song, I must admit that the vocals are just not pleasant to the ears.  Sure, there is a softness and an overall breezy feel to the bulk of the vocals, but in the end it comes off almost shrill.  It's far too whiney for its own good; resorting to off-putting repetitions (don't make me wait) at the end of the song that make me want to turn it off immediately.  There is a bouncy, almost childlike quality to the song, but the production values are dim, with the vocals taking such a backseat that the get lost in the musical arrangement, which is simply effective but doesn't maintain the pop it initiates (even with the beat switch up towards the end).  There is a moment, before the shrillness takes over, during a pre-bridge (that I want her to stay up for the whole night) where I was actually taken over by this feeling of intrigue, as if maybe this song was going to turn around and then it plunged off the edge of irritation with horrific vocals.\n\nPersonally, I'm not interested in getting to know Memory Tapes any better.","5794":"Wrong group but the songs are kind of OK.","5795":"Thank You","5796":"pleasant","5797":"I heard of Sahara Smith the night she performed on a Prairie Home Companion in 2003, and was looking forward to her CD for a long time.  She seemed sincere and had a nice voice and wrote two good songs, and performed them well then.\n\n8 years later she releases this vague set of 'yeah, yeah, yeah' (never heard those lyrics in a song before!) mediocre, boring croonings that does not even include a decent performance of Twilight Red, which she performed better on a Prairie Home Companion at the age of 15.  Now it just sounds way too sad in a bad way and too slow and lugubrious.\n\nHer best song - from that night 8 years ago - Don't Rain Much - is not included on the album.\n\nThis girl is so lost and confused.  She sounds bored.  She was all motivated and proud then, and now is all vague and uncertain and singing songs about not knowing what truth is.  Very disappointing to hear her sounding  . . . just like everybody else.\n\nRead Atlas Shrugged, Sahara, you'll learn something, and you'll have something life-positive to write about.","5798":"I accidentally bought this thinking it was ABBA. It is a cover band, \"tribute band\" whatever.  NOT REALLY ABBA.","5799":"I'm a big fan of Dmitri Hvorostovsky's singing and had viewed some songs from the Deja Vu album on youtube.  I was looking forward to playing my own album and interested to hear more of his crossover music which had been highly praised.  But the disc was a huge let-down, mainly because of its unbalanced mix - all the songs overpowered by a thumping bass and facile orchestration.  His voice is still beautiful and his diction - in three languages - is excellent, but he would have done better to sing a cappella, the mix was so bad.  And then - to add insult to injury - the DVD of Toi et Moi !!!  What on earth induced him to introduce chains, whips and a woman screaming in .... pleasure? Anguish? Who knows?  Who cares?  Whatever it was, it was ludicrous, cliches stacked on top of cliches in a package that would have been offensive if it wasn't so laughable.  I think I'm still a fan of Hvorostovsky - singing opera and Russian folk songs - but this album does nothing to enhance his reputation and I won't be playing it again.  In fact, I'd give it away if there's anyone out there who wants to go to the trouble of letting me know where I can send it to.","5800":"Excellent","5801":"Timofey Dokshizer is one of the greatest trumpet players in the world and this CD is certainly a musical tresure.","5802":"The whole song seems like it has a lower volume,  i can't describe it.","5803":"Been listening to the dong since I bought it.","5804":"i don't listen to music because music sucks to me. i rather not and won't listen to music period q","5805":"This is very bad one, and can not be used for perfomance, wasted my time and money!","5806":"I thought the original version was amazing but not until I heard David's version. This song is absolutely marvelous. This puts everyone else's version on a back burner. David Phelps is one of my favorite artists and this is one amazing song.","5807":"I am obsessed with this album... I love EVERY song on here. great rock, great voices, sexy lyrics.... does it get better?  REALLY wish they had more music.","5808":"This is honestly my favorite album of all time!","5809":"Love the song","5810":"The best performance of this piece I have ever heard. However the CD master has digital clipping in a few places.","5811":"After discussing performances of this work through emails, my choir teacher from my high school days (a long time ago), told me to play the Shaw version, which we both liked, and then purchase this version. He had sent me a YouTube connection that was this recording from an old, scratchy LP. It sounded terribly slow and, of course, hard to listen to in its scratchy state. He ASSURED me that the CD version had far better sound and that the tempos are considered by most choral music scholars as definitive. I reluctantly agreed to listen once it arrived. First, I listened to my copy by Shaw and his singers: wonderful sound. Then I played this recording. Well, my teacher was AGAIN correct. The sound was very good, if a bit skewed to the left, and the performance was, well... (I'm not a singer any longer, and I don't have the sheet music), but it was just RIGHT. the listener can just sense the rightness to these pieces. And the BASSES! They anchor the work with incredible power. The subterranean b-flat at the end of track 5 is worth the price of admission. Just wonderful!","5812":"Great! Thanks!","5813":"song isn't all there!!!","5814":"aesome","5815":"Was not what I expected.","5816":"Awful","5817":"Why put the girl in front if you don't have her songs at all? This is a hoax.","5818":"A true GOD's gift to mankind!","5819":"Terrible buy.  Rhema doesn't sing at all on the cd.  It is an instrumental.  False advertising!!!","5820":"Its not what u think it is. Move on. This is false. Had nothing to do with them other than a picture of her","5821":"This is not a CD by Rhema and Amazon should remove this seller as they are Ripping People Off. I bought it and it says in small print it is an instrumental music CD. If Rhema father knows anything about this then he should be ashamed. I was completely disappointed when we received this CD as it is made to look like a Rhema CD and it is not. SHAME ON AMAZON FOR NOT REMOVING THEM.","5822":"Knew and respected McCarty as one of the great Rock 'N Roll guitarists of all-time, but I really didn't realize how good of a Blues player he is ... This CD has him playing all different type of Blues ... what I love is that it is essentially a \"Live\" CD ... a collection of jams with McCarty playing everything from slide to jump blues with a big band ... featured guest list is strong Duke Robillard, Jimmy Thackery, Johnny A, John Nemeth, etc ... if you love Rock, Blues, and\/or Rockin' Blues guitar this is your CD ...","5823":"This is a great song. High energy, great lyrics, great sound, and fun.  It's on my running playlist, on my driving playlist (watch out slow drivers!), and on that playlist I play when I am just lounging around the house.","5824":"THANK YOU","5825":"This song is good for this genre of music.  I like the story of it.  It fits me well.  I can have a drink but my spouse always has to have 3.","5826":"Great song","5827":"Another great song.  Blake Shelton has a great voice and sings from the heart.  Can listen to his songs over and over.","5828":"very disappointed in tis cd. I would not recommend it to friends and would not give it as a gift. No good","5829":"Outstanding love song","5830":"WONDERFUL HES GOT A GREAT VOICE A LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY SUN SHINE WOULD LOVE SOME N N N N","5831":"Jon Burchfield rates among the top guitar players in the country.  His playing is both smooth and clean.  I say this as someone who has been a professional guitar player for over 65 years.  His music is always a pleasure to listen to.","5832":"Simply beautiful music.  Jon Burchfield is a master at his craft.  It's like he is playing the music just for you.","5833":"Great song by a great unknown band that people should be listening to and have more following them than they do.","5834":"Billy has created his best album to date.  His rockabilly roots really shine as well as strong songwriting.  He obviously had a deep family influence with this style.  I can't recommend this album enough!  Read more about it here-  [...]","5835":"Wonderful song.","5836":"I was asked how felt about this cd and I said that it was for someone that obviously did not understand english at all because it mostly taught you the vowel sounds and this is what the seller sent to my E-Mail address. \"Wow (_________) I am recovering from a stroke. so my handwriting is a little messy. You still got your item and on time. Isnt that what really matters. My handwriting bothers you that much.\"  What in the world is this nut talking about and how unprofessional of him.  He must be tired of selling on Amazon or something.  Be smart and stay clear of this one.","5837":"This is an unbeatable combination of great singing and great lyrics.\nWhat a voice.a gold mine would  recommend highly.get it","5838":"Just wasn't enjoyable to me.","5839":"Rings true especially today.","5840":"I had a frustrating time with this CD. I am a new singer and I was hoping this would help me strengthen my voice while I drive.\n\nThe music is very professional, on an electric keyboard. The guy sings the combination once through at the beginning of each exercise. But each exercise is complicated, like \"Ha-he-hee-hee-la-la-loo-loo-e-i-e-i-oh\" (every syllable a different note). Instead of playing the melody that I need to sing along with, he plays background chords and I am struggling to remember the melody that I am supposed to be singing. Then he keeps interjecting \"helpful\" things during the exercise like \"Remember to relax your jaw\", \"Be sure to breathe properly\". Then I am even more lost because I am still struggling with the melody that I am supposed to be singing and he is talking over the chords and I don't know where I am. Then, during the SAME exercise, he will change the sound I am supposed to be singing, \"Now sing it with \"Yaw-yaw-yaw, instead of Yee-yee-yee\" (or whatever). More frustration and demands while he is pounding out chords and I am lost and I have no idea what the melody is. Not fun. Not helpful. Too confusing. After the third exercise, I just gave up.\n\nI would have rather simpler melodies, stick with the same sounds per exercises, and play the melody instead of chords so I know where I am supposed to be, and stop interrupting.","5841":"Couldn't find the songs to play them","5842":"This is my favorite song from this album, and I plan on purchasing the album later. I wonder if this will ever be remastered.","5843":"one of the secret Jpop talents!  she can sing, sexy too!","5844":"\"Wired Life\" marked a strong move into a much more hard edged Techno sound for Meisa Kuroki, who has been previously involved in much more RnB styled music. \"Wired Life\" is at 128 Beats Per Minute and it would make a good late night club groove - the verses of the song have an elegantly brooding mood to it contrasted with a powerful but poised chorus. If you like the music of Goldfrapp, Little Boots, La Roux or perhaps Miss Kittin, then you will like this song from Meisa Kuroki. If you're well versed in Japanese music, this song is probably closer to the music of Perfume, Kotoko or Saori@destiny.\nMeisa Kuroki sings with a strong clear adult pop-soprano voice with no vocal affectations. Unlike some of her peers, she doesn't go in for the use of vocoders or other electronic vocal treatments of her voice.\n\nThere are four versions of \"Wired Life\" offered here - the standard song, which clocks in at just over four and a half minutes. There's an instrumental version, which shows just how good the electronic music is in this song. A mix with dialogue from the anime and a short anime version.\n\nA further version of \"Wired Life\" appears on Meisa Kuroki's more recent single, \"Woman's Worth\".\n\nHopefully, a new album by Meisa Kuroki is in the works. I think that 2012 will be a big year for Ms Kuroki, and Nami Tamaki, too, whose new single \"Lady Mind\" could be the \"sister\" single of \"Wired Life\".\n\n2012 - I predict that Meisa Kuroki and Nami Tamaki will be doing some great things in the realms of Japanese electronic\/techno-dance music.","5845":"It's a beautiful song. The one star is for Amazon's stupid process of requiring a download app to be installed to access an Mp3 that has no DRM. The user experience is garbage and Amazon should know better. You guys run AWS. Figure out a way to provide a download link to an Mp3 without making me go through an app or hidden instructions or similar garbage.","5846":"Bechet is a master musician, the music is timeless.  I could and do listen to it frequently.","5847":"Marilyn McCoo is a fantastic singer, but the material that was chosen for this CD was very bad.","5848":"How do you take a classic and highly recognizable voice and totally wreck her debut CD?  This is the blandest, most unimaginative music ever.  Someone made a huge blunder when they asked her to record this mess.  She deserved much better.","5849":"Saw Harlend a couple years ago in concert 3 times and boy do they rock! I bought their first CD, an EP at one of the shows and it was great; I eagerly anticipated a full length album which this is. Some of the guys are from another local band I also saw numerous times and disbanded for whatever reason and then formed Harlend. They certainly know what they're doing.\n\nFrom the bands Website: Keep You not only offers the desired catchy melodies and strong hooks you can find in other popular music, but more importantly it presents a challenge to its listeners. It is a call to action, a call to love, and cry for revival. With massive guitars, pounding drums, thought-provoking lyrics, and gut-wrenching vocals, Harlend is a welcome addition to any iTunes playlist.\n\nPersonally I feel the album doesn't break any new ground but treads the same Christian rock ground as many of their contemporaries with passion, gusto, and conviction. I highly recommend Keep You.","5850":"is not compatible with windows 8, the download could not happen. So beware if you have windows 8 and don't bother.","5851":"Excellent melodies and interplay between the musicians. Will Patton's tone is amazing and his lines are always tasteful.  I highly recommend this album.","5852":"Perfect. Peaceful and very good song selection.","5853":"Great song. Very bad sound quality.","5854":"The reason I'm so pissed off by this is that I got the Ozzfest 2007 Sampler, not the 2001 Sampler. Don't take my decision.","5855":"Never got it. I tried several times and each time I got the same message. So I couldn't say if it is good or not.","5856":"This folk-pop album is a pleasure to listen to. The songs have a genuine, heartfelt feeling, and the arrangements are clean and true, and, well, real. The upbeat \"And I'm Happy\" has an almost anthemic quality, while the \"Grandfather Song\" stirs up memories of loved ones lost or never found. After listening to the gentle, comforting second track, it's easy to believe that Everything Will, indeed, Be Just Fine. Long distance love is the topic of the pretty ballad \"Back to Minnesota\" and the foot tapping, rock-style \"Mile 77.\" The youthful final track, \"Get it Right,\" reminds us of the ups and downs of new love. All in all, a terrific debut that makes me eager to hear what comes next from this talented newcomer.","5857":"Like a gentle rain that arises suddenly and blooms into a downpour - that's Lynne's voice! It caresses you and finally lifts you into heaven. It can be soft and operatic without diminishing the feeling behind the lyrics. Give this Broadway babe a chance and you'll search for more of her hidden gems - I did and was not disappointed!","5858":"The score calls for musket fire during the battle. Some performances actually have this. This one does not. Banging on the edge of drums is a poor excuse for the battle sequences. Why can't they just play it the way Beethoven wrote it? Save your money, this performance sucks.","5859":"Great","5860":"I like that song","5861":"Love this song","5862":"Love","5863":"Had to throw out the first cd due to profanity! I don't know why in mastermixing decent music must a dJ has to continually add curse words. I won't ever buy another of his cds.","5864":"Love his sulty voice!","5865":"I like this song. It's very nostalgic and kind of sad, but it takes me back to my childhood in Bulgaria.","5866":"Not the kind of music I want my kids listening to.  Yuck! No more open Amazon left on computer..... Parents listen prior to purchase","5867":"Good song but fck u how do I play in my iTunes? So frustrating stop being propeietal and make this user friendly.","5868":"Was exactly the track I was looking for.","5869":"Great Song!","5870":"I am in love with this CD! I heard one of their songs on the radio and just had to hear more. I am so glad I purchased the disc! It is amazing! I highly recommend it to everyone!","5871":"Terrible sound quality. Not a very good performance either. Save your money. Or buy the classic album Killing Is My Business...","5872":"Awesome.","5873":"I was looking for Je Suis une Femme Amoureuse, I thought that was the one I purchased.  Was pretty sure I saw the correct name and artist.  However when it was downloaded, I received that song.  HATE IT!!","5874":"Beautiful.","5875":"This is fairly typical of French \"street music,\" with accordion and female vocal.  It is neither \"outstanding\" nor \"poor.\" Nothing special.","5876":"Nice track","5877":"Good music for square dancing or line dancing.","5878":"Love this song.","5879":"I had never heard of Ms. Frehel until I tried this.\n\nYou might not like this.  I'm eccentric enough to love accordion music and polkas.","5880":"Great song!","5881":"Why?  Because when I downloaded one copy I got about a dozen copies all of which seem to be only 30 seconds long and none of which I can add to a playlist as it is on an MU3 file which doesn't mix with any of my other music files.","5882":"This is a typical French\/Paris cabaret music.  The sound quality is not very good, which indicates this might be a live recording.","5883":"We used this song today in our worship service and we're greatly blessed. I have been looking for it for quite awhile & couldn't find it for purchase until I checked Amazon. Thanks!","5884":"It was the first time I had heard the song, I am a Viet Nam vet with friends on that wall. The song was wonder","5885":"An online games friend from Germany recommended this song to me. I love it! Haunting and well done. It will remain one of my favorites.","5886":"simply awful! always skip! It is the live version from a concert..timing is off and it just sounds awful.  Wish I had not bought it.","5887":"What the heck has happened to Falling Up? Their last album blew, and this album is just as crappy. Jesse Ribordy (lead singer) has to know that this new, slower, sadder sound is just absolutely depressing to hear when compared to Falling Up's other albums. It's not rocking AT ALL! I was willing to forgive the lameness of Fangs, and when I had read the other reviews of this album, I was filled with hope that maybe Falling Up had returned to the sound that had made me such a fan. I was so optimistic that I 1-clicked bought this album without even hearing a snippet! And now, after listening to the lameness that is Your Sparkling Death Cometh, all I can say is \"can I get my money back?\"","5888":"Is very good song.","5889":"I really like Ryan Farish music and play it whenever I just want to sit back and relax.....however it's the type of music that I think will appeal to many people's tastes.","5890":"This aria is, quite simply, one of the most moving things I have ever heard in any opera, either classic or contemporary. As someone who has had a lifelong \"I love you \/ I hate you\" relationship with religion, this aria, about a character struggling with his own loss of faith, spoke to me deeply. When Frank (tenor Vale Rideout) sings \"What a Friend We Have in Jesus\" in gospel style, accompanied by what sounds like a slightly out of tune piano (nice touch!), it's actually devastating. Brilliant words, brilliant music, brilliant performance.","5891":"for the time it was written and how long it is, it's slow, I just can't seem to get into it,","5892":"Best song!","5893":"love this cd","5894":"There are so many places to go, mentally, while listening to this music.  It certainly stirs the imagination.  Sounds great on a Bose.","5895":"You have got to be kidding me. Come on, what is the real price? This is the only offering of this CD, everything else is MP3 download which I do NOT want.... But i ainna gonna spend THAt much for this CD no matter how good Adrian's music might be!","5896":"Bought for a gift since I am not a fan on Boxcar Willie. Only one song but the title looks like several songs!","5897":"Could not watch dvd. Wrong region.","5898":"I've enjoyed the bulk of their music over the years.  This however seems to miss their usual cuteness and energy and wacky pronunciations.","5899":"This song gives me a negative impression with vocaloids singing. If it was sung by an actual human without so much other junk I think I'd like it. I like the music and lyrics. The vocals are off...","5900":"As the singer said himself; You really Stink. This song is Anthem to one of the last pure AMERICANA heritage. Good to hear when constipated.","5901":"I am a Wilson Meadows fan and enjoys anything he puts out.  This is a nice track to listen to.  Especially since it has been a while since he has released anything.","5902":"I own another track called Autumn Leaves by Coldcut which I absolutely love.  I thought this track would be\nsimilar based on the very short music sample I got to hear on amazon.  Unfortunately the sample played only\nthe nicest part of the track and the rest was not my taste at all. The rest of the track was a day and night\ndifference from Autumn Leaves as well as from the sample portion of the track, so I found the sample very\nmisleading.  Good thing I paid only 99 for this track and didn't buy a whole CD with this kind of music.","5903":"Not what I expected","5904":"Thoroughly enjoy the songs, the lyrics, music & playing! It is very authentic, heartfelt & timely with great musicianship. Particularly love the harmonica playing & vocals. The songs are organic & the recordings sound warm & soulful.","5905":"Highly hypnotic tune. The recurrent bass line has been stuck in my head for a week...and with this tune, that's a good thing!","5906":"Rick Robinson heads this wonderful set of six musicians that make classical come out of its theater to the more accessible platforms for people to listen to and enjoy! Gitcha Groove on is a stupendous neo-classical composition that blends folk elements in its intricate notes. The violin,viola and cello renditions are marvelously in tandem and the talent of each of these performers gets a free rein of expression that delighted me completely :-) :-) :-)","5907":"first I heard this on Di. FM. I love the second half. It's a nice chill music (down tempo)","5908":"I recently saw Bailiff in concert (more on that later). Bailiff is a Chicago-based band led by singer-guitarist Josh Siegel, and their musical, while often labeled \"blues-rock\" certainly has blues elements but the music is much more than that. This is the band's second (and as of yet, most recent) album.\n\n\"Red Balloon\" (10 tracks; 40 min.) starts off with the short, introductory \"Crickets\", only to then dive in with \"In the Reverie\", an all-out rocker that reminds me of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, yes. \"Everyday Fire\" charges hard too, driven by a relentless bass. Side A concludes with \"Emptied Out\", a slowburner for sure but oh so good. On Side B opens with the title track, a slow, reflective tune that gives Bailiff and us the listener a brief breather. \"When I Leave You Will Stay\" is the most bluesy track on here. \"Overheard\" is the last highlight of this album. Bottom line: Side A rocks hard, and Side Be is more reflective but it makes for an overall great listening experience.\n\nI recently saw Bailiff in concert at MidPoint Music Festival here in Cincinnati. They played an early evening set. The trio's live sound is bigger and more massive than anything you hear on their studio output. I kept wondering how they were able to make the intricate wall of sound, at times prog-reminding music, with just those 3 instruments (guitar, bass, drums). If you have the chance to see Bailiff live, by all means do not miss them! \"Red Balloon\" is a nice album, but let's get some new studio material already!","5909":"I guess this artist is much like scotch ... an acquired taste.  Don't be fooled by the reviews.  Really lackluster.","5910":"I love this CD. Blues and Swing performed exceptionally well. Seems like everything just clicks. Buy it!","5911":"Very good sounding music.","5912":"This was not purchased by me, but by someone else whom I gave (temporary) permission to use my Amazon account.","5913":"Very good, relaxing music.","5914":"I'm always on the lookout for good guitar driven modern rock with clean vocals. It seems to be getting harder and harder to find these days, with so many bands turning to synthesizers, retro lo-fi garage band sounds, or emo screamy vocals. Sleeper Agent is good music though. Celebrasion has kind of a wild crazy, in-your-face party vibe going on, and it's super catchy and fun. Every song packs punch, with snappy beats and belting guitar rhythms.\n\nI can't really think of any bands I can compare Sleeper Agent to. They have a bit of a modern indie sound with maybe a bit of punk, but it has a breezy, carefree quality to it that makes you move. The vocals remind me somewhat of Grouplove or Modest Mouse, which I think is part of what gives them that \"indie\" sound. But the music... Make no mistake, what you get here is straight up, no holds barred rock, and it's fantastic.","5915":"don't know what i was thinking","5916":"This is not from the movie showboat soundtrack","5917":"have always loved his music","5918":"A cheap knockoff of the original.","5919":"I thought it was by foster the people not whoever the poser is! I would not have gotten it. Thumbs down","5920":"Heard this as the ending for Gintama and it is one of those songs that gets stuck in your head. Also, my kids love it! Had to get the full version so we could listen to it all the time. Very pleased with the quality of this version.","5921":"too expensive","5922":"You know how music is-- if you like it you probably like it a lot. If not, then not.  I like it.","5923":"I saw Laurie Lewis for the first time at the KY Center for the Arts many years ago. She sang this song and I fell in love with it then and I still enjoy it.  Wish she would come back to Louisville, would love to see her again.","5924":"This is the first Elixir album I have ever listened to, and being a huge Maiden fan, the experience so far is a positive one. The \"dueling axes\" here are pretty good, and the vocals are also good (but there's only one Bruce). If you like IM, or that type of metal you will probably enjoy this album.","5925":"Just what I wanted. His music is soul soothing. Sit back and relax and feel the beat. Just fantastic sound.","5926":"This song worked well for what we needed it for.  Overall was a good choice for an activity at our fiesta.  could have been a bit more lively, but overall a pretty good choice.","5927":"This is the most obscenely disgusting piece of abomidable art in the entire history of music. I hope you take my critisism to heart.","5928":"This must be the worst version of this song that is available for download.  Not sure who was killed to make this happen, but it was complete murder for my ears.","5929":"This is not the real version, it's horrible. Even listening to the sample made me cringe. \"Pumped Up Kicks by Foster the People\" is the real version.","5930":"bought the original not the remix - its the one I like and I would give that one a 5 star rating! hope this helps.","5931":"Doesn't do any justice to the original. It basically took all the fun out of the song. I don't understand why people are buying this?","5932":"Free download. Sampled and deleted. In my experience, only about 1 out of 10 of Amazon's free song downloads are keepers, and that's if your music tastes are eclectic.","5933":"Downloaded by accident and listened to it but it wasn't my cup of tea. It was decent.","5934":"I loooooooove this song.\nLove love love love love love love love love love love love love love love it.  :D","5935":"I always liked the Dodos, but never felt any great passion about them. But I think the passion in this song might be infectious. It could make me a bona-fide Dodos fan. This song starts off with a pounding heartbeat rhythm and proceeds with loose guitar and free-feeling vocals, soaring all over the place. The energy builds through the song, inciting involuntary head-bobbing and hip-swiveling. And it's even got a singalong chorus -- you know, if you can understand the words.  And if you can't, who cares?  You'll end up singing them anyway, 'cause that's the kind of song this is!","5936":"I purchased this song because after watching the third Gundam Unicorn episode. This is the end music and I have had it stuck in my head since. I looked around for the artist and found the song and artist here. I like to listen to it while writing, great song!","5937":"ver bad song ui hate","5938":"I searched some years for this song. I checked every place on the Internet I could think of. And guess where I finally found it .... it Amazon. Incredible! I was also able to find a pair of DonnKenny pants here that I was having trouble finding in my huge metropolitan city. And now I'm heading off to shop for some eyeglass frames. Thank you Amazon!!!","5939":"The song is awesome but it won't download onto my music at all same with blood on the bricks the song those songs are awesome but I can't get them on my thing so it was money just throw it away","5940":"I purchased this song and only this song. What I received is another song by another artist from a compilation album.  Where is my song?","5941":"Saw him in 1984@ WSU in Pullman. Showed up with his dog and shared a special night of song. I'm sorry to hear of his passing, I would have loved to sit down and have a beer with him.","5942":"Great tone and compisition. I have to say that the third track on this cd is my favorite. I hope that this guy is planning on a full instrumental cd in the future.","5943":"The, song was great but the service at Amazon music is terrible it won't even download onto my music","5944":"Ugh...after listening to so many fine choirs sing this gem, I can't stand the rough, grating, in-your-face sound of this recording. Bleccchh!!!","5945":"I chose this version because Rutter brought out the organ part. In addition, he selected one of the best British organists: the late John Scott","5946":"Beautiful, but not what I expected.  I would not want to listen to this often.","5947":"If, like me, you think that \"The Big Roar\" was the best album in the past 25 years (or maybe ever) then you just can't get enough of the songs from it.  This has 2 remixes and 3 live versions of songs from \"The Big Roar\".  Are they as good as the originals?  Of course not.  Do devoted fans of TJF really need this? Of course.","5948":"This is the whole band.  Some songs resemble their new stuff, but other songs are available that were preformed by lost members that have a very good and distinctive sound.  It is all accoustic, yet is, to me, one of their only complete albums.  The new albums, although great, seem like only half done.  This is truely a great album, and remains one of my favorate out of all the cd's I have.","5949":"Oh Man......what a GREAT and uplifting song!! I also watch Mr. Anderson perform it live over and over on You Tube. I have NO use for the verse about ''thanking Mohammed'' though. I am gonna use some software to delete that verse, thank you! I spent too many years in the Middle East. I KNOW them people...........so.","5950":"I had to give this a rating and there isn't one low enough for what I think of it. I bought this for a joke for my husband. Not one of my better ideas. This keeps popping up for me to review it. It's in my emails and keeps haunting me. I wish it would go far, far away. I hate it!!!","5951":"These guys rock!  Really wish they would put out another album, this one is quickly becoming one of my favorite albums!  If you have seen their video you can tell they really perform well.  Who is the lady in the video????  LOL","5952":"I bought this knowing that it wouldn't be great, but I was going to see the musical and I like to have the music in my head before I see any musical. However, from the second the overture stated during the actual show, I realized that this was NOT the soundtrack, not even close. If you are the same as me, DO NOT buy this album, as it is not the musical soundtrack (even though the cover sort of matches the posters.)\n\nIt's like a bunch of people -- having no idea there was an ACTUAL Flashdance musical -- recorded a bunch of songs that they had lying around that thought might be in a musical. \"What a Feeling\" is there of course, as is \"Maniac\" (both of which are also in the musical). \"Gloria\" is not.  Then, they add a bunch of random \"80's\" songs, none of which have anything to do with the story. \"Fame\" -- ok, I guess. \"The Rose\"... Hm... \"Maria\" from West Side Story... WTF?!? By the time that you hear \"Let The Sunshine In\" from Hair you realize that the producers of the album were tripping too hard during the 70's to notice the transition to the 80's.\n\nTotal waste of money-- this is an album of music that is kinda sorta not really inspired by the IDEA of a Flashdance musical. But not good inspiration -- the singing is third rate and the song selection is lousy. DO NOT BUY unless you really like these songs-- but listen to the previews first!\n\nBTW -- There is an actual Flashdance Musical, and it is actually really good, and this album is really an insult to it. When THAT album comes out, I will totally buy it.","5953":"beautiful","5954":"Great song","5955":"I just adored this.","5956":"I own the EMI set republished in 2011 of this record. Though I hear marvelling things about this recording, remastered especially for EMI Japan, the price of over 400 USD for a set is unreasonable!\nLet's wait and see if the price will drop over the months. If NOT: I am affraid there will be almost NO buyers for this (wonderful!) record.\n\nI owned a set of Gebhardt of this Ring: it was impossible to listen to the shrill and harsh sounds of that 'remastering'! I therefore have send it back to Amazon. So I stick on my version of EMI which is a very fine one. Despite so much critisim.. [I think I have a right say here, due to my music professional backgrounds].","5957":"In a few years we'll be hearing about Eden Wood on TMZ when she's arrested for DUIs and stoned out of her mind. She has no talent. Her mother is destroying her childhood.","5958":"It is not Chicago I ordered it by mistake I wish I could get a refund","5959":"I felt that this group did not give justice to Abba.","5960":"Sad burnt ends and remnants from the whitest black group ever. Nothing here worth listening to. Hopefully, there is nothing else left on the cutting room floor to be recycled. This is garbage that even a completist will find appalling. Poor sound quality, too.","5961":"I love this composer because of his rich melodies and moving themes.  This album is no different.  \"Eternal Ice\" was a song I heard on Youtube and I had to immediately get the entire album because of that one song.  That song is simply beautiful and moving all the way through.  I also love \"Welcome to Trollstad\" because it sounds like a battle theme from a video game!  It's simply superb!  \"Where I Belong\" and \"Gaelic Earth\" are both happy songs that I could listen to for hours.  I recommend this to everyone.  10\/10!","5962":"This CD entitled \"Music Therapy For Deep Sleep - Relaxing Nature Sounds and Music\" is produced by Super Audio PVT LTD in Chennai, India and performed by Joseph Vijay.  It is close to an hour long and is structured into six tracks of which five are about 10 minutes long and a single track (Track 3) is only about three and a half minutes long.\n\nOk, let me say upfront, this is only my opinion.  There are fans of every type of music...music I don't like, others will, and vice versa.  I don't like this CD.  I found it very uneven and, toward the end, impossible to relax to while listening.  The first track, Forest, is pretty good with a single piano composition.  There are bird sounds in the background but they are so soft that they fade away as the piano is playing.  The second track, Surf, is also pretty good.  The composition is played with a piano (or synthesizer?) with some electronic enhancement like reverb.  The surf is loud enough to fit well with the piano lead.  But by the third track, Storm, the CD begins to go off the rails.  The lead is a high pitched piano accompanied by strings.  The storm is essentially white noise in the background with an occasional wind gust that reminds my of a windy dry desert.  The fourth track, Thunder, is jarringly high pitched with strings, winds, and some piano interspersed with thunder.  The fifth track, Waterfall, brings back the piano\/synthesizer? with reverb.  The waterfall sound is almost indistinguishable from white noise.  The score is played so slowly that the composition is just occasional high pitched random notes rather than a musical score.  The final track, jungle, brings back bird sounds and a high pitched piano with reverb.  The last four tracks are so jarring that they kept me awake rather than relaxed me.  This is not a CD for sleeping.  It tries for a drifting New Age vibe but completely misses the mark.  The integration of nature and music is poor and the track scores are more annoying than relaxing.  You won't be falling asleep listening to this.","5963":"Love the song, but I can't to a playlist and it does not show in my recent purchases!!!","5964":"This is a awesome song it came out when I was young. Nice to hear a wacky song from the past","5965":"Catchy little song. I believe Mouthbreather finally reached a new high with this two song EP, then they split. Their maturity as a band pours out in these two songs, while keeping that classic sound they are known for. Plus, I think they mastered the two singer schtick. If you have never heard this band you should check them out, well worth your time if you like a harder punk\/alternative.\n-z","5966":"All broken to pieces inside. Threw them out.","5967":"This was for my brother","5968":"Not the original artists. Even for free, it's not worth it.","5969":"AWFUL. NOT THE REAL THING. AND FOR A RIP-OFF ITS PRETTY BAD. Just don't waste your money on it. I was stupid enough to.","5970":"PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS!!! I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WAS A RIP OFF WHEN IT WAS $9 FOR 40 SONGS! PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID. I REALLY SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS FIRST.... X(","5971":"The songs are not performed by the original artists, they are all cover bands. Already mentioned by another reviewer, but I was foolish and bought this before I read the reviews, hope you don't do the same.","5972":"Hell, such a waste of money to buy this.\nI did not know that the music was not from the original singer.\nHell, I want my money back if I could.","5973":"These are not the original songs by the great artist who performed the hits,  these are just knock-offs of each hit trying to make a quick buck!  Better get the \"Now 39\" which has the actual hits","5974":"I don't like this song...waahhh. I thought I liked it when  i was 13...but now not so much. so yeah","5975":"Trivium is amazing and this song has been the way my life has been for the last  ten years it has helped me with cooping","5976":"Found it on rock band 3. Awesome on drums. Started buying other songs. Great band luv to see em in concert.","5977":"This is good music that is interesting, creative as well as being entertaining. I look forward to listening to future music contributions.","5978":"Monarchy doesn't disappoint with this offering, \"Around the Sun\".  Melodic, haunting and danceable.  Reminds me of the Pop-Electronic tracks of The Pet Shop Boys in the 1980's.  It is hard to find this kind of thoughtful layered track production with catchy melodies and memorable lyrics in this day & age of throw-away \"Bieber-esqe\" & \"Iggy A-style\" Schlock Pop.  Keep it up, Monarchy!  I'm looking forward to their next release. :-)","5979":"Found these guys from the Phoenix Alive song being on the FIFA 12 soundtrack. Looked up this album on spotify and wow! I'd compare their sound to cut copy\/m83 in that it's the resurging 80s sound with a stronger dance element. I'd say these guys have the best singer of the bands with a similar sound.\n\nI know folks check reviews to look for best songs to listen\/buy. It's tought to pick songs from this album though because it's very cohesive and doesn't have any throw away tracks. That said, Phoenix Alive and Love Get Out Of My Way are probably my favorites. I really encourage listening to the whole thing though because it's solid from start to end.\n\nAll in all a really strong debut that sets these guys up for a great future!","5980":"I bought this one after sampling another cd of his.  I like all the songs on this cd too!  Can't wait for the next one!","5981":"I am a big fan of this catchy and groovy tune. I listen to it with my buddies while chillin on saturday night","5982":"I bought this off the Amazon MP3 player app on Android and didn't realize that it was NOT the original. This \"remake\" is awful.","5983":"This album carries the retro element of Rose Hill Drive's sound into the glam era.  Adding a member buries the low end with a faster, higher pitched tone.  The melodic vocals of the earlier work are replaced with the kind of spastic squawking David Bowie used for effect in the late 70s with none of the tuneful baseline singing he balanced that against.  Somebody young and hip must have convinced them it isn't cool to sing pretty or write songs longer than a movie trailer.  The young geniuses who blew bands like The Who and Van Halen off the stage and brought down the house at roots rock gigs like Wanee have decided to make an album for rich kids in skinny jeans.  The musicianship and songwriting is still in there but the overall tone of these songs matches the packaged indie rock you hear in commercials for smartphones.  We can hope it's a phase they'll grow out of.","5984":"Excellent song, perfect for dancing. Heard this song 20+ years ago, and it never gets old.","5985":"An absolutely brilliant album! Not one bad song from cover to cover. They definitely have a bright future in front of them.","5986":"It's very catchy, you'll like it.","5987":"\"This is one of my favorite songs. I think it deserves five stars for being an enjoyable yet tiring song to dance to in my Zumba classes every Friday.\"","5988":"The stories are scant and inconsistent. Anyone seeking detailed, research-quality information or even a coherent theme will be disappointed. I'm glad I bought this with reward credits and not with my own money. Mr. Munday needs an editor and a better producer. I would not buy further products without evidence of both.","5989":"I can say that I absolutely love the lyrics and musical compilation of this song! Great blend of choir and lead vocals as well as musical transition throughout the song. Great worship track!","5990":"Ah yes, this one ranks right up there w\/England Dan & John Ford Colley, Firefall, Lobo,& Barry Manilow. I must have been in love at the time.","5991":"Did not appreciate it, was disappointed, so returned it to you.","5992":"1 Straight To Hell\n2 I Believe In This\n3 Laughed You Out The Door\n4 Easy Street\n5 San Francisco\n6 All I Want\n7 Nocturne\n8 Tell Me That Story\n9 I've Got The Next Round\n10 Killin' Me\n11 You My Love","5993":"The amount of time didn't allow me to really experience the song , its a bad remix I want my money back.","5994":"Awful recording.","5995":"Sounds like an amateur orchestra, horrible sound, bad entrances. Sounds like a microphone falls somewhere in the middle... Bizarre. Is this a fake?","5996":"I wore out this record when I was young, I played it so may times.  The sound quality is as expected for its time, but the music is very accessible.","5997":"First off,who is that on the cover? Certainly not the Johnny Richards one would expect! And in previewing the tracks, most are awful! Better to find it in other sources!","5998":"The performance sounds almost amateur, I can' believe this is the Concertgebouw! What's going on?","5999":"I really like Gaza Slim\/ Vanessa Bling. She is from Vybz Kartel's label and is a promising new talent. Give it a listen!","6000":"Great quality, no complaints!!","6001":"I could not use it. There is need to be more original. There was no demo attached to enable proper understanding of beat.","6002":"One of our favorite songs of worship. We use this product at our services. We find this product very useful. The instrumental sound is very clear.","6003":"The product arrived damaged,and not playable. Unfortunately,I tried too late to listen to it to return it. I won't buy it again,because most of the tunes are available on other Spotnik CD's.","6004":"This Sucks.  It is not complete","6005":"All the songs are good","6006":"Incredible trombonist with the most beautiful sound. Great band as well. I saw Si live several times in the 60's. Si was an extremely exciting performer live!","6007":"Someone got it all wrong. This is not Dvorak Symphony No. 5; It's not Dvorak at all. IT'S BEETHOVEN FIFTH SYMPHONY","6008":"I have the original album. It's great but this mp3 copy is LOUSY. I hope Amazon can get it cleaned up.

I downloaded the free songs & liked what I heard, so I bought the whole album on impulse.  I do not regret this impulse buy at all!!  It reminds me of New Order\/Erasure\/Pet Shop Boys\/Depeche Mode\/etc from the late 80's to early 90's.  I haven't listened to it often enough to know what the songs are about (yet!), but I just LOVE the music!!","6012":"have always dug rare earth, Peter Rivera is one of the Iconic voices of rock, this one is going to be in the player awhile Get It!!!!!!","6013":"I'm a DJ so I get it that Mother\/son songs are supposed to tug at your heart strings but this one is sooo over the top, its ridiculous.  My vote for worst lyric of all time is, \"...And who could forget, three meals a day....\" In reference to his mom providing 3 square meals of food everyday. Who could forget\"?  Plenty would because when we recall our mums we don't base it on her instinct to feed us!  Terrible use of that phrase. Its also way too long. You don't want your mom out there on the floor for six minutes.","6014":"This is a simple yet powerful song!! God longs for our fellowship and who says it can't be in song!","6015":"NOT  IN  STEREO as  originally  recorded.  I  put  my  stereo  LP  on  CD  and  it  sounds  better  than  this.  This  has  distortion  in  sound  and  vinyl  ticks. Sound  isn`t  bad  for  what  it  is,  but  that`s  not  saying  much.","6016":"My daughter and I love this song and the video. The original song has a catchy tune, but the subject matter is a bit nauseating. But you'll listen to it over and over! If you are still unsure, go watch the youtube video - you'll love it!","6017":"I was previously familiar with only more traditional performances of this classic Israeli song, but I was not able to find them on amazon. For instance, there is a YouTube performance by Lea Shabat.\n\nThis rendition is more jazzy, with a fluid meter, which I originally found to be disconcerting. Now I enjoy it. The singer's voice is very pure and pleasant.","6018":"What sounds, on the test clip, like a performance of this song turns out to be background music to a long spoken introduction by Mr. Horn instead.  Very unsatisfactory.","6019":"Amazing!!","6020":"Iturbi at his very best.  You will never hit the fast forward button.  Each and every piece of music is exquisitely done.  I can't say enough.

It really sounds like she recorded it in her bedroom on Garage band, which is really endearing. I suspect she may have an agent or manager that wants to make her the next pop sensation. The smart thing to do would have her keep pumping stuff like this out - a shower of bubblegum stuck in the hair of millions. The cover art is horrible.","6024":"It's one thing to watch and participate in being led through Worship by this amazingly talented musician once a week, but to be able to \"take him home\" and continue to listen and learn through his Words is a blessing like none other!

This is a magnificent piece and one of the best performances.  However, the title \"Complete String Quartets of Ludwig von Beethoven\" implies that the purchaser is going to get 16 quartets, not just one.  What a disappointment!\n\nAs minor points, it is worth mentioning that the composer's name was Ludwig van Beethoven, not Ludwig von Beethoven, and that the Budapest String Quartet made three recordings of his complete string quartets, which are noticeably different.

There is no music on this, just the introductory babble from the narrator.","6037":"I requested \"old RADIO SHOWS\". Amazon took me here to theme albums,Stupid me, assuming they had different complete sample shows of a series of shows.  No its just like a trailer for a movie.  There are no shows (programs) and even the themes are incomplete with some ending in the middle of sentence or song.  I want to return and cant find an easy way to find, with seemingly no return buttons for music. This is like a sample only album. It makes absolutely no sense.

So don't take my rating too serious. I am just trying to get the item off of my needs to be reviewed list...lol.","6048":"This song is really just kind of blah. The vocals seem forced, and it also sounds like the vocalist is really just talking over the guitarist while he\/she is trying to play. It isn't very smooth, doesnt really flow, and is kind of just boring. It's not horrible or unlistenable, but i cant imagine going out of my way to listen to this again, and i could easily see myself kind of simply wandering away. Not much here at all.","6049":"This is my favorite symphony by Dvorak.  The performance is good.  It's not spectacular, but it's perfect for my cell phone .  I listen to it often (several times a week) through ear buds or via bluetooth on my car stereo.","6050":"Terrible version of this song. It is a country song and this version is all jazzed up.

How do you return an Mp3 download?","6061":"Rating a song could seem silly- a totally subjective opinion.\nI bought this because one day the chorus popped into my head and I thought I might like to learn to play it.\nI ignored the mediocre vocal and the clumsy arrangement.\nWhat I couldn't ignore is that the lines of the verses are all different : different melodies and amounts of notes.\nI got to the point where I was going the re-write the song so it had consistent verses. I stopped myself because, really, it' s not all that great and worth saving.","6062":"Praise God for His son! The song is great. Wish them all the success in the world, spreading God word.","6063":"Too good to pass up, this is my seventh album by the great Clifford Brown.","6064":"Excellent performances, but excruciatingly horrible sound quality. I don't know what the source of these recordings was, but there was obviously no effort to clean up the sound or improve it in any way whatsoever. Makes for a painful listening experience!","6065":"Easily downloaded and added to my current account. Really liked how easy to navigate through the site.","6066":"Song is what I wanted HOWEVER the recording that I download is horribly flawed!  (And I've downloaded it twice--just to make sure it wasn't an issue with my first download.)\n\nWhat's wrong?  DISTORTION galore Jack.  I'm wondering if the digital track for \"Teach Me Tonight\" by Brenda Lee was somehow mastered using a scratched VINYL record as the source!??  I've purchased over 300 songs from Amazon, and this is only the second track to be problematic.  First problem track I purchased was an instrumental recording of \"The Big Country (Main Title)\" by The City of Prague Orchestra,  That recording sounds like the download somehow became a bit scrambled.\n\nSo, if only 2 out of 300 downloads are bad... well I guess that is a pretty good track record.  But AMAZON Q&A managers... please tell your technical people to double-check recordings before you permit them to be purchased!  And if your team recognizes that a recording has technical issues, at least INFORM the potential buyer before hand; that way, if they are willing to take it (flaws and all), so be it.  Thanks.","6067":"The original Bizzle hits!","6068":"Typically your 1st Christian album you really put it out there with your faith, you're #unashamed.

It is a re-do Possibly many years later.","6071":"Your soundrack was amazing! I enjoyed it in the yogscast's SOI series and I enjoy it on my kindle. I'm getting Dark horizons as well! :)","6072":"This was an original, 1957 STEREO recording by the late, great Paul Paray and his Detroit Symphony.  It's considered a worthy example by many as Paray has a strong following.  However, do NOT download from here as this recording is in Mono rather than stereo, and the quality is very poor.  I think it was \"remastered\" from a Mono LP.  Not worth even the lowest price, save your money and buy the CD of the same work, paired with the Franck Symphony!","6073":"See my review of the MP3 release of the Sorcerer's Apprentice.  Same disappointment experienced in this release ... it's almost as if they merely digitized my old, very old, LP (or a 78 rpm).\n\nShop around!  This may be the interpretation you prefer (as do I), but many, very many, recordings are available where you will not be distracted by the pops and hisses of an old record.","6074":"ok","6075":"Listening to \"Come To Mary\" is like taking a trip back to the summer of '69 and the psychedelic rock that was a part of it. I wouldn't be born for 2 more years, but I listen to a lot of Rock from that era. This song is reminiscent of harmonies of Jefferson Airplane, the delicacy of America and flashes of the intricate guitar work heard in the music of Grateful Dead. Take a look at the mystical sounding lyrics and I think you may get the idea:\n\n\"Come to Mary; she don't mind.\nCome to Mary; she don't mind.\nBecause everybody gets to have their time,\ncome to Mary; she don't mind.\n\nTo everybody left behind,\nto everybody left behind;\nthe world feels wicked,\nbut I'm feeling fine.\nTo everybody left behind...\n\nI'm the one who cannot let go;\nhow I long to stand beside her golden glow.\nCome to Mary; she don't mind...\"\n\nJesse Sykes & The Sweet Hereafter do a good job of recreating this impression of yesteryear, yet it sounds genuine and not an affectation. The song is pleasant and I'm glad for the chance to add it to the playlist on my Cloud Player. It isn't what I would consider a hit, but it has a genuine appeal. The 60s vibe is carried on through the rest of their 'Marble Son' album, so if \"Come To Mary\" whets your appetite, the perhaps it is worth dining upon the full meal.\n\n~ Kort","6076":"I LOVE this composition.  I have the original release of the LP.  I listened to it so many times alone (and with my children when they were young) that the LP became dusty, hissy flawed.  I did a digital transfer of my own from the LP to CD.  I really thought this MP3 would clean up the sound I got from my old LP.  NO SUCH LUCK!\n\nI bought this version because it's the one I've always known.  But, there are MANY other recordings of this same work.  Shop around!","6077":"Many many years ago, I first heard \"My Old Man's a Dustman\" on a scratchy copy of the K-Tel album \"Looney Tunes.\" In fact, I still have the old vinyl album. I never ever thought I'd hear a high quality recording of the K-Tel version of the song... expecting to only find the standard release of various Lonnie Donegan albums. Imagine my surprise at not only finding the K-Tel version of the song... but it's in crystal clear stereo! Finding this version of the song really made my day!","6078":"CD had no music on it","6079":"I feel disappointed. With all the positive reviews I had high hopes for this album. I was hoping this  would be in the style of the wonderful albums done by Ronald Nathan. He has a voice that's warm, comforting and confident.

But this one doesn't even begin to compare. The hypnotherapists voice seems cool and disinterested. Some of the music was okay but there were moments where the background music reminded me of the music they play in movies right before or during the big action scenes--I immediately tensed up.\n\nI didn't relax even once during the entire album and relaxation is the key component that makes any hypnosis work. I don't see how the suggestions for determination, motivation, willpower and fighting procrastination will work when I can't even relax when I'm hearing them. With the \"Fast Technique for Stress Relief\" I fell into a deeply relaxed state almost from the very beginning and felt relaxed through all the suggestions.\n\nThere are better hypnosis albums out there.","6080":"Demo- unlistenable useless crap.","6081":"Remembered this song from years ago and decided I had to have it.","6082":"Empire of Fear LP will be PXR's best work yet!!

But as the piece went on I stopped hearing the 'music' and started hearing the piano. Almost feeling the wood. I had no idea who Gordon Monahan was and only know a little now about what he does but this is really something to listen to. One of the few things I've ever heard that made me think and moved me at the same time. Fantastic.","6093":"Songs are not completely constructed for the most part. Goes off the rails with blatting\/screechy\/scritchy sounds that remind me of when sound reinforcement systems are  being set for a performance and there are electrical mis-connections and\/or shorts in the circuitry; that deliberate misstep gives me a headache. (I am trained in electronics, listening, and performance.)  All of his other released disks are far superior, buy SUN instead for just one.  Most anything by Two Steps From Hill far superior as well t lacking deliberate antimusical insertions.","6094":"Awesome cd and good service from Amazon.","6095":"This was a so so purchase.

Of the four tracks, two for each act, the third started with the Overture!  The sound is also horrible.  Skip this on folks!  Fortunately Amazon refunded the fee, and I quickly put the tracks in the trash. Gone!!","6100":"The recording quality is unbearable for one used to the state of the art. It sounds like a worn-out record, or a radio station with poor reception.","6101":"I loved the sound track","6102":"Catchy song and enjoyable to listen to, but not for children, as this is a song for older listeners than kids.","6103":"title track of this cd is pretty good but thats where it stops. The other songs are pretty mundane, some even \"bland\". I would not recomend it.","6104":"Biggs' 1964 recording of the E-flat Prelude and Fugue which is presented here poses many problems.  His use of overdotting in the \"homophonic\" sections of the prelude and taking those recurring sections in a different tempo from the more overtly \"contrapuntal\" sections is both misleading and a misconception.  In the forte and piano alternating motifs near the beginning of the prelude, Biggs renders the three sixteenth notes leading into it as an eighth and two sixteenths, adopting an absurd \"seufzer\"-type two-note phrasing in his inimitable \"touch and go\" style of mostly sempre staccato playing, as Melville Smith long ago characterized it.\n\nThe fugue---really three fugues, each built upon the other and the last two being double fugues (the second is for the hands only)---suffers from Biggs' obliviousness to phrasing: the main subject, coincidentally resembling William Croft's hymn tune \"St. Anne\" (it is doubtful if Bach knew this tune, which made its initial appearance some thirty-one years before this fugue was written), is broken up at (if memory serves) an upward leap of a fourth between B-flat and E-flat.  I suppose the best thing that can be said about this playing is that it's accurate.  Biggs was fifty-eight years old at the time he made this recording, and the master tape was probably engineered by EPB himself (as were most of his recordings in what is now Adolphus Busch Hall). He was in the throes of rheumatoid arthritis, and often in the flesh was not capable of delivering the kind of performance you hear on this record.  The style of the first fugue (for five voices) always struck me as reminiscent of that of old choral motets, and there are many opportunities for approximating a choral sound on the organ in this piece----mostly a clean legato, opportunities for \"stretching\" (i.e., tempo rubato) and so on.  You will not hear any of this from Mr. Biggs.\n\nThe second fugue (manuals only, and challenging for even a seasoned player---if you want the piece to come across with the sense of voice-leading it deserves)---is chopped up and musical lines can only be extrapolated.  The last fugue is just notes.\n\nI should point out that Mr. Biggs made another recording of BWV 552 (in stereo) a few years earlier, on the much larger Schnitger organ at Zwolle, The Netherlands, restored by Flentrop.  It is still wanting, but he took the prelude at a single tempo in that version and (as I remember---I have not heard that record in over forty years) took an expansive approach to the work.  I have not heard Mr. Biggs' earlier recordings of this prelude and fugue (mono era)---but those would be interesting comparisons.\n\nIn his own liner notes, Biggs credits the coupling of the Prelude and the Fugue (which respectively open and close the third part of JSB's \"Clavieruebung\", often called the \"Lutheran Organ Mass\") to Felix Mendelssohn.  Maybe.  It was Friedrich Griepenkerl, the first editor of the Peters edition of J.S. Bach's complete organ works, who presented them that way in the third volume of that edition, and made the coupling stick.\n\nE. Power Biggs, for all his faults, was a unique figure in the history of organ performance.  He had guts, drive and imagination, and essentially created his own position.  He came to New York jobless and conspicuously lacking in funds, initially hoping to land a church position.  He contacted T. Tertius Noble, then music director at St. Thomas' Church in NYC, who found him an Episcopal job in Newport, R.I.  Biggs was eventually fired from that job --- it was assumed that, since he was an Englishman, he knew something about training boy choristers (he didn't) and became disillusioned with the church.  Barbara Owen tells that story in her book \"E. Power Biggs, Concert Organist\".  Biggs took another church job in Cambridge, Mass., which remained his permanent home until he died.  He held that church job until the late 1950s, but rarely played services.  He started an ambitious series of recitals, and persuaded the curator of the Bush-Reisinger Museum at Harvard to install an experimental \"neoclassical\" organ built by Aeolian-Skinner in what was then called the Romanesque Hall. He initiated a series of live radio broadcasts from that hall.  Twenty-one years later, this instrument was replaced by the Flentrop heard in the recording under discussion here.  Sadly, the year 1958---which saw the installation of the famous Flentrop, a marvel of an expanded chamber organ---also saw the cancellation of the radio broadcasts and the onset of Biggs' arthritis, which he fought, as best he knew how, for the rest of his life.","6105":"Oh No.  i thought I was buying the whole 86 Chapters.

Very disappointed.  It's not even close to the version sang by the Boys Choir of Harlem that's actually played in the movie.

Their music is tough, modern rock, which nods respectfully in the direction of bands like Metallica, Muse and Maiden, though they're instinctively carving out their own sound. Singer-guitarist Mike is in possession of a distinctive growl, the sort of rumble that raises the hairs on the back of the neck, on rock fans and wolverines alike, and guitarist Nik drops solos like glass confetti.\n\nConsidering their independent status \"Solid Will Into Sacrifice\" has a vast sound. It's epic and glorious, and no more so than on the title track, which is complex, grand, progressive and systematically heavy. It's an outstanding six minutes and deserves to propel them into major venues. Other tracks are almost as good. \"Listen Closely\" is high energy and aggressively succinct and \"All Tech-no-logic\" releases their inner Sabbath before mutating into something altogether more vital.\n\nIf any of the above is of interest, don't hesitate in tracking these guys down. Recommended.","6119":"One of the Osborne Brother's best songs.","6120":"The singer does an excellent job singing and she is comparable to the original artist Laura Story.

I dnt understand how anyone can say hes a good rapper and listen to his music. He is a cancer to hip hop and he is polluting peoples minds with ignorance. Im not hating im telling the truth","6127":"The song is \"Tea For Two and NOT \"Lazy River\"; too bad, because I'd love to hear Steve's version.  Please change the listing","6128":"This is not the original version. It sounds like a different singer and the music is slightly different. Listen before you buy.","6129":"Had to return this product- no sound from the CD- it was completely blank. I thought there was a problem with my Bose CD Player, but after putting in another CD it worked just fine. This was well packaged but it was completely useless.","6130":"A cheap imitation of the real thing sung by Chris Young. I accidently hit the wrong one and am stuck with it.","6131":"I think you should worry more about the reviews of your operations other than the reviews of record  if you can't hold true to a contract  and adjust your customers for the mistakes ,then maybe you shouldn't be in business","6132":"What the hell, Murcof?!\nI heard an awesome Track \"Cometa\" on Pandora and I've been hearing it over and over again on YouTube so I decided to buy it here on Amazon, but it's NOT the same Track!\nWhat is up? Are Pandora and YouTube wrong or was there a mistake here on Amazon?\nWell, I'm not satisfied. This was not the one I wanted.","6133":"I love this song!","6134":"I sprinkle this song all over my breakfast.  It really gets me going in the AM. I can't wait for more Careless Lovin, there is nothing better than a shot of pcn with my Black Coffee!","6135":"This song breaks me every time I hear it. It convicts & cuts to the heart. He is the only perfect one!","6136":"First things first when I download music I pay for ,I don't like to be told where to place it. i don't want to play it on sound cloud or in windows media player. It is for my personal hard drive. For my use only....! Once if I payed for it. I can play it on anything I want. your new way sucks. I will be trying other sites now for purchases of my music now on. tell you change it back.","6137":"Needed Wicked Circus music for our clown at TERROR IN THE TREES HAUNTED TRAIL and this song is perfect! [...]","6138":"good","6139":"Bad audio","6140":"Can't figure out how to access.  A real disappointment.","6141":"All re-recordings?","6142":"Several songs are not by the original artist. Buyer beware","6143":"This is NOT After the Fire, the original artist, as is listed. Don't buy this unless you want a poor knock-off version!!!  One star is too generous!","6144":"Not the original songs. Sounds terrible. Do not buy.","6145":"If you are looking for the original artists, you won't find them here. Some of the songs are close but not quite to the point where it sounds like maybe it was the teen star grown up. But then there are other songs that sound like it was a bad karaoke night. This album was my $5.00 lesson. Live & learn.","6146":"These are alternate takes and\/or covers. Listen to the samples; they don't sound right. And they're all specifically chosen to not be the most known portions of the songs to keep you from noticing right away. But these songs don't sound right. Avoid.","6147":"I love me some Gabby Bernstein, but I just bought a MP3 of the asking meditation to try it out and she literally said one sentence and then it was just music for the next 5 minutes.  Try some guided meditations on YouTube.  They're much more effective.  But, her book is DA BOMB.com.  Thanks for reading.  I love you Gabby --- but customers don't waste your money.","6148":"I wanted to buy the meditation album to go with the \"Spirit Junkie\" book as an add on to my current meditation practice but have found through listening to the sample tracks that the music is too loud and I can't hear Gabby's voice with the guidance. Even with volume at maximum I couldn't hear her and I can't have the volume too high because I have menierre's ear and loud noise and music are two of my vertigo triggers. This and her other meditation cd's would be perfect if the music wasn't so loud or her voice so soft.\n\nI think a reproducing to lower the music volume would make these meditation cd's perfect for her books and for those who never really meditated before.","6149":"I'm 57 years old and never hear this song before the other day.  It is eclectically funky and a really fun song with a killer beat.  Probably not for everyone, but I really love it.  I have an older model convertible and nothing's better than driving down the road, top down and Funky Cold Medina blasting on the radio!","6150":"This song, like \"Wild Thing,\" has not aged well. Loc sounds smirky, his beats are no longer compelling, and his lyrics are full of juveline misogyny and transphobia.","6151":"Great music from the day","6152":"lovely","6153":"Dark, lush and almost creepy orchestration mark this latest effort by the Finnish band Tears of Magdalena. Capably sung by soprano Magdalena Lee, this single has a very distinctive dark gothic sound punctuated by Lee's phenomenally gorgeous vocals and very high quality production values. If this song is any indication of what is yet to come from Tears of Magdalena, then listeners of gothic melodic\/symphonic metal are in for a real treat.\n\nDon't expect the heavy metal elements found in their previous efforts or the male \"cookie monster\" death growling so common to their first album \"Myths and Legends\".  This song is just four minutes of clean symphonic bliss.  The band has recently restructured and added a multi-talented new singer\/keyboardist\/bassist\/guitarist in addition to Lee and vocalist\/song writer Vasstago Archipelagus.  A new album is reportedly in the works so rest assured that some great things are yet to come from this incredibly talented band.","6154":"Very professionally done.  This is a great CD, love it. Would definitely recommend it.  This is a must have for your collection.","6155":"The songs are basic standard hymns with interesting riffs hear and there which makes you want to sing to the Lord!","6156":"I bought it for my wife workout.  It really is wonderful track with nice audio quality which is good not only for Zumba fitness but also to simply enjoy a nice latinamerican dance.  I highly recommend it.","6157":"Dj Nader is great moves with the hips was my favorite","6158":"Great song and great quality for just 99 cents! Happy with product and would recommend! The Cambridge singers are one\nof the world's most renowned singing groups and they don't disappoint.","6159":"love all the middle eastern beats","6160":"What a great album!  The quality of sound was fantastic and the music was top notch. God  bless Dan and his team","6161":"You buy this album and its almost identical in length to the samples given.  There are no complete shows. most are about 30 seconds and end abruptly, even in the middle of sentence or music. I had asked Amazon for \"old Radio shows\" and got these two albums.  This was deceitful and I am ashamed of myself being suckered so easily.","6162":"For anyone who has ever heard the original version it is a duet with wonderful harmonies. The remake of this song is missing the mark completely. With not allowing the proper duet with the original male singer. The harmony of these women is so off as some of the people singing this song are missing from the remake. In my opinion it doesn't sound correct anymore. Allure should have left well enough alone.","6163":"I didn't like this song at all because this song doesn't sound like the artist. It's not even the right version. I'm not very happy with this at all. The saying goes, you get what you pay for.","6164":"This compilation was obviously ripped off from the TOM (The Old Masters) LP produced back in the 1970s. (The LP itself was a bootleg of old 78s, but that's beside the point). The TOM LP's muffled sound, off-speed transfers, and inexplicable fade-ins have been reproduced here. Save your money and avoid this shady \"Hallmark\" release. Look for the CDs of Coon-Sanders on the modern-day TOM label. They have restored the complete output of the Coon-Sanders band in generally excellent quality and any one of those discs will give you much more \"bang-for-your buck\" than this rip-off download.","6165":"It is a CD of samples...My fault I wanted the songs and not a sample of them.","6166":"One of my favorite Solos by Dorinda Clark-Cole","6167":"This album is nothing short of a 10\/10 rating & here's why: It's musically diverse and the musicianship of Josh Lewis is played very tightly with excellent vocals yet at the same time has rawness which is everything a rock album should strive to be!\n\nJosh Lewis needs to be given credit for a great and inspiring musical delivery overall; each instrument is highly involved in making these songs very much alive and kicking.\nThis is a very consistent effort with the fitting Rock N' Roll attitude written all over it.\n\nThis album rocks and will be timeless, each day I listen to \"Jumpin' In\" it still sounds fresh to me!....If this album were released commercially it would be a platinum seller!","6168":"rip off","6169":"I fell in love with this band when my friend showed me their music about two years ago, since then I've seen them in concert acouple times. Their music speaks to anyone who looks for a little more than just a space cadet experience.","6170":"The production of At The Hillside took 8 months to record in a Sunday school classroom in South San Francisco, California. When the CD was released, the proceeds from the sales were funded to countries that needed financial aid for hunger, weather disasters and building projects. I'm a customer at Amazon and was honored to learn Eldridge Books is offering At The Hillside. There is still a limited quantity of this CD and hope you will consider purchasing a copy for your enjoyment.\n\nThank you, Eldridge Books, and wish you much prosperity in 2012!\n\nSincerely,\n\nBob Eusebio II","6171":"These are merely Tokyopop's sucky substitutes for the original Japanese opening themes from the anime series they licensed. These songs aren't that great anyway.","6172":"I Love horses and this song captures everything I feel when I ride.  I think it is great that Larry Whitesell uses her songs on his training DVDs.  I love her music :-)","6173":"Inventive, moving, and, unfortunately, still timely in our era of continuing war. A haunting, appealing quality.","6174":"I wasn't expecting the vocals to be performed by other than the Eagles. Music was nice. 4 more words required","6175":"I paid for the digital album, but only one song download. This was a great song however the download option isn't that great","6176":"My jam","6177":"Kendric Lamar is A Good Raper He Is Awesome For His Beats And Snaps Ohh And He Is Cool ;)","6178":"This version is not very good in my opinion.  Not worth the money I paid for it.  The singer was not bad, but I expected more.","6179":"not the original artist","6180":"This is almost as terrible as the God-awful Jlo Pitbull collaborations! Sean Paul should exile his sorry no talent ass bk 2 where he came from.","6181":"Do not buy this song. Somewhere in the remastering process something has gone awfully wrong. It's so bad it should not be for sale. Spotify has the same bad mp3-file.\n\nI have the real song and it is a vast difference from what is offered here.","6182":"Not the Eagles. The live acoustic version is on Hell Freezes Over","6183":"Niall Toner has a great bluegrass voice and the CD has several great songs in addition to William Smith Monroe.","6184":"Wonderful voice. Breath taking lyrics!","6185":"fun songs to listen to at any age along with my kids and grandkids are loving is as well will buy more","6186":"Bootlegged. Not even close.","6187":"ALways loved this song, so nostalgic","6188":"Not the songs I wanted","6189":"A Halloween dance tune!","6190":"good stuff","6191":"Like the title says.... so if you're a Staind fan already... which I wasn't, then you will be surprised at the aggressive nature of this and the other tracks from the album. If you are like I was, then you will be pleasantly surprised at how KICK ASS this is! I don't know who pissed on Aaron Lewis' cornflakes but I am HAPPY that they did so!!!!!","6192":"The music was good, but the narration was stiff and stilted","6193":"Holy crap, this was a horrible band. This CD is not worth $1.00, let alone what people are charging for it here. This band was everything that is bad about metal. Wanky guitar solos, stupid misogynistic lyrics, I could go on but I won't. The best thing about Doomzday? They aren't a band anymore.","6194":"I consider this one of the great finds of my more than 50 years of  record collecting.  I picked it up in a $1 clearance bin in Asheville North Carolina.  I have owned another recording by Mal Waldron, the 1986 Village Vanguard group with the great Woody Shaw and Charlie Rouse.  Although many consider this Village Vanguard session to be a classic, I found it boring.  So I was skeptical of this recording. Now, I treasure it.\nIt was recorded in Japan in 1983.\nMal has an unusual piano style, quite unique.  I won't attempt to describe it, but suffice it to say it has elements of Monk, and many other pianists.  Mal's music can be brooding.  The final cut on this CD \"Waltz For My Mother\" falls under the emotion of brooding, and is a lovely performance.\nAnd drummer Ed Blackwell also has an unusual style.  He has taken what I call an old fashioned New Orleans drumming style and turned it to a style suitable to play in the legendary early recordings of Ornette Coleman, Dewey Redman and Don Cherry.  Go figure!  If you can explain how a Baby Dodds New Orleans style of drumming lends itself to the avant-garde, let me know.  At any rate, it works.  Ed's bouncing, elegant rhythm fits in perfectly with Mal's deliberate, searching note choices.\nI don't mean to neglect bassist Reggie Johnson.  He contributes fine accompianment, as well as good plucked and bowed solos.\nThis CD is a swinging, but controlled interpretation of jazz standards such as \"Bag's Groove,\" \"Billie's Bounce,\" and \"Round Midnight.\"  There is great beauty contained herein.  These are mature artists playing at their best.","6195":"When I purchased it through the app on my phone you really couldn't tell it was not by the original artist. I could only hear part of the song and assumed it was the same one. Nope. What a letdown.","6196":"This is Billy Vera.  Although this is a pretty good album of mine, from 1976, I receive no royalties, either as the singer or songwriter from it.  I will leave it to the conscience of my fans as to whether you wish to support a company that does not pay the artist.\nSincerely,\nBilly Vera","6197":"These stories were a nice way to introduce my children to some audiobooks.  The only thing I can think to mention is that the voices are mostly in British accents so they took several listening before my guys were familiar with the stories.  My children started listening to these when they were around two, so I cherry picked which ones are appropriate for my toddlers age and readiness.","6198":"This is an awesome song. A lot of meaning, just beautiful. It really lifts the Lord in a beautiful way. This son g really glorifies God.","6199":"Travis Cottrell is a gifted singer. He has taken a favorite old song and given it a new, joyful rhythm.","6200":"Was looking for this song for a while and figured out the name but never knew who sang the version I was looking for.","6201":"The first 5 seconds is missing from this version,which sounds like it was recorded from a low quality TV set.","6202":"I have been so blessed with \"Once More\" from Travis Cottrell. It has become one of my favorites & I truly recommend it to my Brothers & Sisters in Christ.","6203":"great music","6204":"Awesome album would reccomend to anyone and everyone. This is a great worship album will get you going in the morning and ready to face your day.","6205":"Saw TheAdvice at Winter Jam and loved the show. Everyone should check out these guys from Greenville SC.  Love them!","6206":"Just three songs?  The world deserves more of The Advice.  Harmonies, melodies, rhythms, all swirling together like a perfectly blended, soothing praise smoothie!\nYour light shines has very Chicago(ish) horns with a great lyric and harmonies.  Beautifully done.\nJumpy, smooth and happening, Forever Changed just kicks you in the aural shinbone and grabs your attention.\nYour Love Sets Me Free has that guitar\/organ\/piano Mowtown feel kinda groove.  Beautiful imagery in the lyric.\nListen and love!  Three very solid, beautiful songs!  ONLY THREE???  Bring the album!","6207":"Awesome song.","6208":"I don't remember this song, so it probably sucks.","6209":"This is NOT the actual Barney Miller theme music, but an interpretation of it. It also starts in the middle of a bar and so is useless. Don't waste your time on this.","6210":"I'm not happy with this one.","6211":"Ass with the other review, I was disappointed by this version.  It's not the original from the TV show, doesn't have the bass intro.","6212":"It is only the part they play at the ending credits,  not the full theme that I wanted and paid for! I want my .99 back.","6213":"Great soothing voice love this kid!","6214":"LOVE THIS SONG","6215":"GREAT JOB GUYS","6216":"Too much of the same for all the CD","6217":"In my yoga class each week the teacher plays the gong during meditation and it is completely transforming.  So I wanted to have this experience at home.  The sound quality of this CD is not nearly as good as what I experience in person.  It is not the person playing the gong.  It seems to be the technology used to record it.  I had expected it to be acoustically superior but it sounded as if it had been recorded with poor sound equipment.  I have listened to this once and don't think I would listen to it again.","6218":"Wagner was the George Lucas of his day, cribbing bits and pieces of authentic legends into a confused mish-mash of, in his case, fantasy opera, as Lucas later did in space opera.  Wagner was the apotheosis of the Central European late-Romantic tradition's devolution into pure bombastic excess.  As music could not develop further in this direction, in the 20th Century composers turned their backs on Wagner's overblown emptiness, freeing themselves to explore serialism, atonality, minimalism, ambient sound, and other previously unthinkable techniques.\n\nThe \"Ring\" cycle has since become a staple of low comedy, with the large, screaming blonde women in horned helmets, and the expression \"it ain't over until the fat lady sings\" (what impatient spectators were told while sitting through interminable \"Ring\" performances).  In \"What is Art,\" Tolstoy gives an outstanding review of an early \"Ring\" production that may be the funniest piece he ever wrote.  His insight is remarkable - it's easy to make fun of Wagner today, but at the time Tolstoy saw it, the \"Ring\" was considered to be the highest art imaginable.  My idea of the ideal \"Ring\" would have all of the characters dressed as clowns, with Larry David as Seigfried, Rosie O'Donnell as Brnnhilde (lip-syching to vocals by Yoko Ono), and Justin Bieber as Alberich.  There should be plenty of pie throwing, banana peels, and eye poking  la The Three Stooges.  With the special effects available today, it should also be possible to show someone skiing through a chain-link fence and turning into a pile of ice cubes on the other side.\n\nSuffering through the marathon of an entire \"Ring\" performance can be of value only to specialists in the history of music or obsessed completists.  Castorf's recent production at Bayreuth in honor of Wagner's 200th birthday was roundly booed by the audience.","6219":"It has now been 15 months since the release of the \"This Time\" single that was supposed to be the preview to a full Album release. The single was good and a change from her ballad diva style on AI.\n\nSince then we have had another full season of American Idol, X-Factor, The Voice and Duets and are currently in the 2nd Seasons of X-Factor and The Voice but not a peep from Pia, not even a second single to whet the appetite.\n\nHer day has gone and I can only assume there is some tension between her and her record company because so long without a debut album is too long by far.\n\nGreat potential but a very disappointing let down!","6220":"6 months since first single, still no CD for us grown ups. They are marketing her to teenie boppers who listen to Disney rock music on their cell phones. That's not who voted for her on Idol. Boppers voted her OUT in a shocking upset, remember? Not enough 40 somethings to defend her, but that's who likes her! She is too grown up, pretty and threatening to tweenies. Her producers have no clue how to market her talent. They think real music is dead only because nobody can do it anymore. Her popularity was from adults starving for authentic singer who can emote adult feelings. She is not Gaga or Clarkson. Her voice is much stronger now from a year of working, so she sometimes oversings with shrill vibrato on the recent live performances I've seen on \"So Random!\" and the NASCAR 2011 finale's National Anthem. But she's still great!! Hopefully she will last until her ripoff Idol contract is over so she can sing some real music for us grownups.","6221":"This Product is dialogue\nI was looking for more the Ramanansagar Ramayan Audio CD sound track\nThis is not the sound track\nIts the physical reading of the Ramayan","6222":"I love Commissioned all their songs bring back memories of my childhood. I loved them then and I love them now!","6223":"Good song, a country comedy tune.  Good Singers and good backup band.  Song is a bit rough around the edge but good song","6224":"Sucks I want my .99 back","6225":"I have been a fan of George Szell's Haydn performances since the LP days when I first heard his legendary performance of Symphony No. 88 on the now defunct Epic label. I am writing this to warn others that there is a technical problem with the download of this track and the subsequent track (fourth movement). At 4'50\" into this track there is a brief, but very loud buzzing hiss. Thinking there was an error in download, I downloaded this track a second time and discovered the same problem at exactly the same time into the track. I have notified customer service of the problem.","6226":"A beautiful album of baroque duets (one \"half\" sung by a counter-tenor David Walker).  Romantic, unusual, embracing music and singing.","6227":"Was going to prank my friend with it but short and poor sound even my friend was laughing how stupid it sound","6228":"If I'd been looking for a ridiculous, low volume, crappy, lounge rendition of this classic theme song I'd be thrilled right now...","6229":"You can tell just by sampling the mp3 that it's not the original, which is probably what everyone is expecting.","6230":"Wrong version. My fault, though, for not paying closer attention.","6231":"weirdly quiet and slow pales in comparison to the real deal","6232":"Perhaps I was a little naive to assume that it would be the jazz version, but it does not mean I was not pleased to find out how wrong I was.","6233":"What a gorgeous piece of music. What a fabulous love song.","6234":"Big Up Beres everytime!","6235":"Good but not Carole King.","6236":"I like dj screw & i give him love and respect, but the rapper spent half the song talking about DJ Screw (Robert Davis).  If you put all that into the rap lyrics it would be ok, but you just can't stop the music & talk.","6237":"Great live set and a great track.  Highly recommend this entire album as well as checking them out live. Great energy and solid music.","6238":"Oh my....how to rate this\n\nFirst, some perspective:  I love Gilda. One of my favorite movies. I love the movies various renditions of Blame It on Mame, even though rumour has it that is was not actually Rita Hayworth singing.\n\nThat said, this version of Blame it on Mame IS the actual solo guitar rendition from the movie...including Glen Fords lead in monologue. It was cut directly from the movie and is NOT a stand alone complete title. As such, it is very disapointing.\n\nHonestly, I could have just recorded it from the movie myself, and I would have done a better job clipping and cleaning it up.\n\nI suspect (though Im not going to bother checking) that the movie and songs are public domain, and that whoever recorded the song, edited it and converted to MP3 saw a way to make a fast buck\n\nSo 5 stars for the song, -3 stars for a direct movie rip (and rip off)\n\nRecomendation: Skip it. You may as well rip it from the movie yourself","6239":"liked the name lol","6240":"It's not the ok bartender, they put whatever songs into the cd with the \"okay bartender\" cover. It's a scam!!!!","6241":"The album was stuffed into my mailbox. Guess how that turned out?","6242":"This is one of the best albums of strings music ever.  I listen to it probably once a week or so.  Great study music, great driving music, great relaxing music, great everything music.  Sounds great on my surround system.  I wish MASS's other 3 albums were as good as this one.  Music like this is unbelievably hard to come by -- anyone who wouldn't give this album 5 stars is on crack.","6243":"I downloaded the Amazon cloud and tried to download the song, but had no success.  Still don't have this song.","6244":"Doest not play just spins look at bottom of photo and yes absolutely troubleshooted yes I'm hooked and have all bars for internet and have 4G and it's not my device","6245":"The arrangement is confusing","6246":"These are wonderful\/relaxing recordings to serve as background for traditional Sikh yoga and breathing practice. The medium tempo and pleasant drumming\/ambient noise is very helpful.","6247":"good","6248":"If you like christian music, then you would love this song.  It's very iinspiring and love I love his voice","6249":"could be better","6250":"This is a nice sounding song, enjoyed listening to it even though I didn't understand a word of it.","6251":"The wrong song down loaded.  Amazon it let me down load the correct song.","6252":"I enjoy good gospel and the team is a good one.  The words in the song really speak to me and I will and have already recommended Dawkins & Dawkins.","6253":"Could be better.","6254":"Received this album as a Christmas gift a year or two ago and let it gather dust until recently. It's been a pleasant surprise. The arrangements are full and beautiful and the playing is wonderful. Makes me want to play the piano. A pleasure to listen to.","6255":"Greenrose Faire - Neverending Journey (Independent)\nGreenrose Faire is a six-piece medieval folk-rock band from Finland. I imagine live they're an absolute blast, and go down a storm at medieval fairs, and suchlike, but \"Neverending Journey\", their debut long-player, is worthy of attention in its own right. Their jaunty playing, Tomi Hyttinen's songs and Salla Rimmi's classic folk vocals come together to form something that falls between Steeleye Span's finer moments and the hugely enjoyable Circulus. The fact that their record sleeve brings to mind the minstrels in Ingmar Bergman's \"The Seventh Seal\" just adds to the kudos.\n\nUnusually for this sort of project, they neither pander to metal fans or proggers. Instead they stick to their own vision of five hundred year old song and dance music, with the latter desire to get an audience moving, an important factor. It's rare that I come across so many instruments that I don't know. These include a dadgad guitar, mandocello, Irish bouzouki and ifteli. If their desire was to worry my spellchecker, they've succeeded on several counts.\n\nThere are a number of tracks on \"Neverending Journey\" that I find myself returning to with some frequency. The opening call to arms of \"Dance 'Til Morning Light\" seems to function in the same way as Fairport's \"Come All Ye\" on \"Liege And Lief\". \"Beggars And Thieves\" has all the energy of The Levellers at their most strident (I am, of course referring to the crusty folk-rock band rather than the 17th century English radicals), and not forgetting \"Witchdance\", another floorshaker, and not unlike All About Eve - but considerably more fun.","6256":"The music is fantastic,  but I never could be used,  I can't download in my tablet, I prefer cd than mp3","6257":"Bought complete series, not helpful or good meditations.  Wasted money.","6258":"Love, this CD and use it most days for my meditation practice.  I have other CD, but this one is just right for my needs.","6259":"I would say that only 1\/3 of the cd has songs by artists i like.  Most of the other artists are unknown to me and i was not pleasantly surprised by any of them...","6260":"Wow","6261":"The music was amazing, the actual physical CD was the same quality on half the songs as if it was literary burned off of a cheap CD ripp\/low quality mp3. This sucks.","6262":"There are only 3 songs!","6263":"Not what I wanted","6264":"i was not able to listen to this as my computer had blocked access\/came up not known, so i was not able to listen to it","6265":"Lamest sound effect for frying bacon ever.  I would shop elsewhere if looking for something that sounds real. Keep shopping.","6266":"I've read several biographies of Rita Hayworth that make a point of the fact that she was never allowed to sing her own songs. Even Robert Osborne on TCM made that point in his intro to one of her movies. The only information I can find on who might have dubbed in the actual singing is from her obituary published in the New York Times, which credited Anita Ellis for the singing in four of her movies (but only listed \"Pal Joey\" and \"The Loves of Carmen\"). It's a bit of a disappointment. I love Rita's singing in the movies and the songs in this collection, but how can they pawn this off as a Rita Hayworth collection if it's not her doing the singing?\n\nHowever, I purchased several of the songs in this collection anyway because I enjoyed Rita's performance in the associated movie. When I listen to them, I see Rita in the relevant scene from the movie.\n\nSo the bottom line is: go ahead and enjoy the songs but remember that it is not Rita Hayworth doing the actual singing.","6267":"I thought I did have the music from the series theme song which this one is not. Oh well, I hope for the next time I hope I have the right one.","6268":"Since I could not sample the whole song anywhere, I got stung on this purchase.  Looking for something about friends for a silent family film I am remaking, I thought this would be a good background, but take it from me folks, the rest of what is not in the sample given is just horribly awful!  I gave it one star only so I could write this review, but it deserves to have no stars at all, a waste of my dollar.","6269":"Works for me as background music for a slide show video I made about camp this year. The songs theme fits right in with the slide show presentation.","6270":"This is only 1.07 seconds long. Kind of ridiculous for the money. The recording isn't as clear as it could be.","6271":"Yolanda Rabun understands this song so well. She performs it with great skill and musicality and deep feeling. But it's also sexy and fun. Her musicians compliment her style with their own spare, jazzy, tasteful riffs. I look forward to hearing the rest of the album--and much more of Yolanda Rabun","6272":"It is, to put it mildly, a \"dated\" collection of mostly-secular songs which would be unfamiliar to anyone now. Richard Ellsasser was a brilliant organist, with a massive repertoire, so I bought this recording just to hear what he did with the few marches one would still play today. It's not *that* interesting! The organ isn't identified here, and for that matter, most of the composers aren't identified, either. Ellsasser recorded mostly on the large but quite peculiar organ of the John Hays Hammond Museum at Gloucester, Massachusetts. It had the resources to play pretty much anything, but ultimately isn't a very good organ. If you're curious about what was clearly a commercial recording - Ellsasser playing on a recording meant to be a money-maker, rather than anything of artistic merit, ,go for it. Otherwise, I really would skip it.","6273":"It was such an honor to be a part of this project.  Jeanne wrote some amazing lyrics and Kathryn's music and direction was awesome.  I can only express how honored I feel having been asked to participate on this project.  This is an amazing tribute to Jeanne.","6274":"See title! I thought the single was great way to introduce these two rappers. I would love to see a video for it!","6275":"This album is such a paradox. It has really great music, and some of the worst, weak lyrics. Maybe their lyrics will mature as they do. I am no puritan, I can use a f-bomb like a comma in a sentence, but this guys drop in at the most inopportune time.","6276":"Yes I bought. But our postman fall it  in  the water and cd 's  are wet.","6277":"This is a powerhouse of blues rendered exquisitely by four of the finest women artists ever in the business.  I wish there were another set featuring Nina Simone, Lena Horne, Nancy Wilson and Etta James.

In addition, each contained a bonus track, a part in the \"Listen With Nicko\" series, in which drummer Nicko McBrain tells about the songs on the discs, in his own humorous way. Each part in the series included a special voucher. Ten vouchers could be exchanged by mail order for a limited edition box in which to store the CDs or records. Although the individual cds and vinyls are nowadays still fairly easy to come by, the boxes are a bit harder to find.\n\nJust another peice of rare Maiden product for the true fan or collector!","6279":"Excelent","6280":"Peppermint creeps rock.

This is more like a jam session without any soul. Very boring and flat.","6284":"Wonderful Mae West album from 1966. Particular favorites are Day Tripper,Shakin' All Over,and Twist And Shout. Mae had the knack of taking a song and making it hers.  Mae West will NEVER be forgotten.","6285":"\"Where the Streets Have No Name\" as interpreted by 2 Cellos...... I am reeling so dizzyingly by the excellence of this song that I don't think I can even write an articulate review. If you gave me a choice of a live performance of this by 2 Cellos and a live performance by Bono himself, I would have to sit down and think that over. Hotter than lava.","6286":"As advertised","6287":"Absolutely fabulous!","6288":"Both my wife and I love this duo representation and interpretation of this song.  This is a superb melding of popular music with the sweet sounds of the cello, which easily slides for intense to mellow and soft.","6289":"These guys are really great. I didn't know I was a cello fan but I love this.  Very lovely rendition.","6290":"If you have a Droid STOP this music download is HORRIBLE  it doesn't offer you the ability to listen before you're forced to purchase only to then be informed your device is NOT compatible you should use another device or PC if you want to listen to what you've been forced to purchase.

It get me pumped and ready to burn calories!","6296":"I'd like this song a lot better if it had a real chorus instead of just the title over....and over....and over.....and over....and over.......","6297":"I did not order this. I don't know why it is here for me to rate. I like only contemporary Christian music anyway","6298":"Once again, Amazon sometimes gives me an MP3 file when I buy an MP3 song, and sometimes gives an AMZ file. I have sent emails and made a phone call and still cannot seem to get them to give me this song in an MP3, which is what they advertised. The MP3 help dept. is of no use. Their answer amounts to \"sorry, try again\". They always have you pay first, then find out you can't use the file. Their downloader caused problems on my machine, so I uninstalled it. There is really no need for their MP3 downloader or their Software downloader. Your browser will work just fine. As mentioned, I get MP3's just fine without their downloader, whenever they choose to send me MP3's.\n\nTo date, I have paid for this song, tried 3 times to get it, and still don't have it. I have asked if they could tell me in advance of paying which songs will be MP3's and which will be AMZ's. They act as if I never asked and tell me to download it again. I am putting this here because they don't listen when I email or call.\n\nAmazon is over all a great company, but their software and mp3 download operations are being run by the wrong people.","6299":"Not the original but a slower and groove version.","6300":"I think this song is epic. I first heard it in the 90's and thought it was odd but good. Fast forward to 2011 and I had a completely different take on it. My adult ears could appreciate what my preteen ears couldn't. I like this cover better than the original.","6301":"to increase record sales and attention kelly has to be the nymphomaniac struggling to prove to everybody she's just as good as beyonce.","6302":"Skyler Gray is a shame because Skyler Gray never lived a life where she was ever really invisible, because she was always getting praise for acting off of the script; where she frauds human expression, because acting off of his script is an act. She is not singing - she imitates. Most people lack allot of character, and Skyler Gray depends on you being inferior.. Yeah, because if you can entertain yourself - you will not idolize her. Yep, she needs you to be a lowlife, and she needs to keep distracted from developing the character to be able to entertain yourself; by scripting insincere acts, toying with (fans have given me admissions and confessions) envy\/lust, keeping you low and or in the past with scripts that are a pathetic melancholy demeanor, or imitator actor using a phony sex appeal image. Skyler Gray scripted words that were never meant to be delivered in the form of a song format. Why is she imitating singing then...? Go do it! Go script words and act (imitate singing) of the script - you're acting and projecting a fraudulent and insincere form of a message and singing expression. Why, other than to get and that mainstream dream seat, because sing\/rap imitation enables national attention and feeds the approval problem. Skyler Gray is certainly not the type of woman to be a leader, as far as somebody who is lived much pain and suffering being in isolation, against their will, and being invisible to the world, because girls like Skyler Gray keep real woman and real singer\/rapper unheard and buried. Even worse, the lyrics that she scripted, the insincerity; just exposes how vain and selfish she really is, because it describes somebody who will never be happy, until she's able to be a phony image on a cover, and projected to the entire world.","6303":"As someone who struggles with an invisible chronic illness (and has for 7 years) this song is very relatable to me. It also has lovely music though, and is beautiful all on its own. Originally found it through a support website and am glad I did.","6304":"so many kids out there are confused and trying to find themselves - the song is an anthem to depression and self destructive behavior. These types of songs do not guide a young mind to grow and choose a better path. Instead they're sadistic and unnecessary - I really hate when my 10 year-old tells me this is a favorite song she hears on the radio - and it's ubiquitous - there are few stations a young person won't hear it. Can't get my daughter interested in NPR yet.","6305":"I got these remix ones of Lady Gaga for Poker Face, this, and Bad Romance.  Believe me I'm not picky, but they aren't very good - whoever does these did bad.  When Madonna remixed her songs, they do a better job.\nLady Gaga remixes are cr*ppy for some reason.","6306":"Because there is an emphasis on the riffs and rhythms of Foster the People the beauty of Edge of Glory, especially in the refrain, does not come through as clearly as I hoped it would when I purchased the song.","6307":"did not like it","6308":"Great song..","6309":"I just love this song.  The harmony is terrific.  Listening to it reminds me that it is not what we have now but what God has blessed me with thoughout my life.  God is good.","6310":"I was in the mall & heard this song playing in the store & instantly caught flashbaks of how I loved this song when it 1st came out  years ago....Needless to say I immediately went the Amazon music store & downloaded it....Man I wish RLwould come back out with some more sexy music....A true R&B singer","6311":"I thought I was buying \"The Edge of Glory\" as opposed to the remix. This remix version is not to my taste.","6312":"Not good. Not relaxing","6313":"This song really hits home when you realize that what you have believed was a lie, and when the truth comes out, you accept it no matter how hard it is.","6314":"good song","6315":"This band openned for Metric on a recent tour and I enjoyed most of their live show so I decided to buy the cd. That and the fact that they're from Nashville. Well, my bad. Mona is one of those bands that sound better live, and when you get home and listen to the cd they're not as impressive as you originally thought. I ended up giving it away to a neighborhood kid who seems to like.","6316":"How is it that all of the official remixes of a song this huge have turned out to be useless compared to the original?  I do really like the Bassnectar remix...but for a dancefloor, none of these remixes on either of the releases make the song any more fun than the original did.  Most disappointing batch of remixes I have seen in a long time.  Most of them start cold and allow no room for a layered mix.","6317":"I like Will Ferrell, but I didn't like the intro that much.  Should have ordered the original song instead.","6318":"This musical track is relaxing and hill and perfect for me t unwind to","6319":"I really like \"The Edge of Glory\" and I thought I would enjoy this dance mix; however, the music hides the beauty of the tune so much that I don;t like the re-mix (even though I do enjoy Foster the People).","6320":"Good band","6321":"Relaxing","6322":"I Was Happy To Get This Rare Classic Top 40 Hit Song! It's One of My Favorites!","6323":"Horrible singing voice, Even more terrible lyrics, and pedestrian, cooke cutter beats and song arrangement. This buffoon is the type of polished turd musical acts that get excessive airplay on South Florida's wretched FM radio stations. Really?? Love how radio stations that play this crap say on their announcement that they're \"playing South Florida's Best Music\". If you believe that, go to a neurosurgeon and have your brain checked because i think what you have in there is actually a piece of shite instead of brains!","6324":"This is great and interesting music. This is music that is both creative as well as being entertaining. I look forward to listening to future music contributions.","6325":"I'd pass on by.  Not good quality.  Too many mediocre songs to clutter the cloud or device, Try 'A Paris' if you can afford it by the same great entertainer..","6326":"These guys just don't have what it takes. I want George and Garth.","6327":"This selection of isochronic tones combined with the ambience sort of brings about a mild \"tunnel focus\" that helps you analyze and complete what you need to do. If you find your mind wanders while working, try using this while you work. ALSO, I use Technomind's \"ADHD - Focus and Concentration\" track, BEFORE I use \"Focus for Complex Tasks.\" \"ADHD\" clears your mind, and then you can go fly with \"Focus.\"","6328":"Melody notes are not true to Composer's arrangement.  Lyrics are contemplative but vocalist is too free with jazzy style and ruins the feeling that Richard Gillard trys to convey.  Not suitable for a Catholic Hymn setting.","6329":"I just love this song! Very creative lyrics\/ nice music..My favorite! Saw him in concert with Taylor swift. Great artist.","6330":"Yea Im one of those people for sure.","6331":"I knew of Cee lo long before his \"pop alternative outings with Danger Mouse, But a friend of mine played this album for me. Souful and groove heavy with a dash of \"different\". Me likey!","6332":"Let me just politely say that if you went to the Renn Faire or Pennsic and were blown away, and something deep within your soul craves more Tartanic like mine did, this is not the CD you want. Trust me. You want \"Uncivilized\". And you want to open all your car windows and blast it, preferably driving slowly up and down your street in a quiet residential neighborhood. I'm sure there are some people somewhere who really like \"UnFaire\", maybe some European disco types or something. Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just not my cup of mead. I know, I know, this is art, and artists need to be free to go where their artistic expression takes them, and who am I to judge. But really guys? I guess I should have been tipped off by the name, but then again I probably am as stupid as I look. Nine dollars worth of stupid. Oh well, \"Uncivilized\" was worth at least double what I paid for it so I guess I came out even.","6333":"100% Guaranteed to make your lifting session more productive.\n(Percentages approximate.)","6334":"past his prime","6335":"Where do i start with this wonderful collection? not only has this CD shown me a way to positively assess my every day tasks, but has also supported nothing but positive thinking. its helped me clear out all the negative, misleading speed bumps in my life like constant misdirection from my goals, and has even helped promote inspiration to go out and embrace any or all possibility. this is like my breakfast for each morning, one of the many helpful techniques that should be a part of any healthy morning routine. thus said, i thank you again for yet another life inspiring collection of affirmations :)","6336":"Soothing sounds that make it easier to deal with the day!","6337":"I have 8 of these recordings that have become treasures.

No idea how it is working.","6342":"Eh","6343":"Wonderful music.  Great to listen to.","6344":"I got these to try to help me fall asleep at night.

I have varying levels of insomnia (depending on the day and my anxiety level) and struggle to get to sleep as well as stay asleep, to make things worse, medication only seems to work for me for about a week before my body grows accustomed to it and the medication stops working. My therapist introduced me to meditation and, after I commented on how well it worked during our sessions, suggested that I try it before bed to help clear my mind. These work great for this. I especially like the ones with the birds and\/or wind sounds, it's so peaceful and not obnoxious like some of the others I've heard with excess sounds. They help me visualize that I'm in a field or something in the middle of nowhere. One thing to keep in mind; this is a compilation and I found that I already have some of the songs on the full album, so I would suggest going through the samples and checking that you don't already have some of the songs.","6353":"Sherwin's music will put you in the moment.  Watch out, you may loose track of the time as the gentle sounds carry your worries away.  I have to be aware of the time or run the risk of loosing hours on tasks, although  the task gets accomplished, usually better than expected.  If you have the  chance to see him live you are in for a treat.  I have seen him at  festivals and his songs have  enchanting effect.","6354":"Wonderful music.  Great to listen to.","6355":"I'd heard similar live music at a craft fair and thought I might like this.  Unfortunately, it kind of wears on you after a while.  It's not the soothing music that I was seeking.","6356":"I'll admit that I consider myself as one with very discerning taste in HOUSE music. This is not one of those compliations.","6357":"This CD is not bad, the production value is alright, and some of the songs are decent BUT it is not house, its contemporary disco and theres a big difference there.  Buy it if you like relaxed disco, not if you're looking for cutting edge house music.","6358":"It's ok","6359":"It is difficult to comment on a product I have not received.  Needless to say, I am a dissatisfied ...

The good thing about these loving, meditative tunes is that it sounds like they're of higher mastering quality than the dull CD of CELEBRATION which is all we've had for years. The entire Deuter catalog to 1985 should be remastered, but who has the money... Alas!","6365":"I love almost all the songs on this album and it was totally worth the money spent. Praise the Lord for a passionate voice!","6366":"I don't remember this song, so it probably sucks.","6367":"Best Victorian music ever","6368":"Please be aware half of the recordings are live recordings and I think it should be mentioned on the front cover.","6369":"I liked it","6370":"Ok","6371":"Awesome tune!","6372":"wish I would not have ordered it.","6373":"This song makes me smile.","6374":"Who can't relate? Love this song and Eric Church","6375":"This musical title is anything but Classic or Egyptian.  It's downright wierd.  I've listened to a lot of classical Arabic music, particularly  Egyptian music, both modern and golden-era.  I'm also familiar with a lot of fusion music.  This CD is different from all of those.  There is singing in English, with lyrics that are frankly a little dumb and almost Orientalist-sounding.

Glad to finally have a version I like!","6384":"When I purchased this I didn't realize that the songs weren't sung by the original artists. Maybe it says that somewhere, but it wasn't clearly communicated. They are covers of famous country songs and not very good ones at that. There is no point in buying this CD unless maybe you know someone who sang on it.","6385":"i clicked thinking it was a smoken deal and found out it was not. it is a cover band they are ok but its just a little off. i would not wast my money.","6386":"These guys sing great, the music sounds great, they may not be the original artists but they do one hell of a job sounding like 'em.","6387":"The songs were recorded by \"countdown singers\" rather than the original artists","6388":"1.

This album, being a remix album, is a bit different than Zero One's standard fare.  Nonetheless, it is still quite enjoyable, but perhaps not as much as the originals.","6392":"Scratches every were not  happy.","6393":"I really appreciate the record arriving on time--however, because of the way it was packaged, the corners are bent, so it's not exactly a nice souvenir to add to my vinyl collection, and it doesn't look very new.

Not as advertised and a waste of money--happy I didn't pay more....","6397":"Love the album, every song is my # 1","6398":"I love this piece of music, but I don't love this performance of it. You don't hear the snare drum clearly, and that seems especially important at the beginning of the piece. It's beautiful, but it's not the performance I thought I was buying.

However, The Grand Floridian Society Orchestra's second album \"Puttin' On The Ritz\" packs in old time classics with as much charm and hidden treasures as the spectacular hotel itself. Featuring about 45 minutes of nearly forgotten hits of the 20s and 30s, the album misses the familiarity of the band's first release but repents itself with lush sound and soothing vocals; an odd solo in \"Boo Hoo\", however, is a tad off-putting, but doesn't scrape this otherwise grand album!","6421":"Let me 1st just say this....The fact that these guys aren't signed to a major label or at the least touring the world is flat out crime.\n\nThe Bastard Suns are one of those bands that putting any label on them is just not going to do them justice.

The band is amazingly tight, the drummer is just incredible, & the singers voice.....what can I say.....it's phenomenal!  There's no strain to it or falsetto, it's like Jameson Whiskey, smooth & harsh at the same time.\n\nTheir originals are great, fun, pub songs, and the covers they choose suit them perfectly.  And in case you haven't listened to other EP's the song selections suit the Season they were written for perfectly! These EP's are an incredibly original way to put out their music.  They allow their fans to get to know each song well enough to sing along to them & right when you start jonesing for more...POW!  A new one was released.\n\nBuy all 4 of these EP's you won't regret it!","6422":"There horrible!!!!!!","6423":"A cherished reminder of the late Mike Porcaro, purchased prior to his death. Great hearing some Toto classics and other tracks with a few different players. Excellent musicianship as you'd expect.","6424":"Thought it would be great to give to my kids. This is something they can also hand down to my grandkids as well.","6425":"Touches me, no matter what mood I'm in. Keep it in the cloud yall. Great is the day he took your place.","6426":"I downloaded them when they were free, and wish they had more.  They definitely have amazing talent...I love the singer's voice.\nI'll definitely wait for them to release their full album for me to buy.","6427":"I don't remember this song, so it probably sucks.","6428":"This is one of my favorite recordings of I'll Tell Me Ma because the performers aren't trying to run a race with it.  It's a personal choice, and my choice is to listen to performances that don't try to cram as many notes into a second as can be pushed.  That's just me.\n\nIn this recording of an old Celtic favorite the tempo is quick without trying to win the Indy 500, the lyrics are understandable, and the fiddle stands out enough for me to hear.\n\nThis one I like.","6429":"Hey who doesn't like the shuffle.","6430":"Great song and I enjoy it.  They are a fantastic duo and have sung many fine songs. Thank you very much.","6431":"I think it is great that they took the time to make a Christian workout sound track but...\n\nThey trashed some very good songs in this mix. Some of the vocals are VERY BAD.\nAlso the tempo is the same for almost all the songs. Rather than 50 songs it sounds like one VERY LONG ONE.\nNot what I was looking for, but better than nothing.","6432":"Ok first of all I ordered my copy from Amazon Warehouse Deals. It was listed as Used- Like New.  I have ordered many many things with Amazon, but never have I received such a mis labelled mess as this.  First off the original packaging of the CD's was horribly damaged.  It was dented, scuffed, torn, bent and scratched.  Tape was added to hold the package together which had been advertised as Factory Sealed and there was a sticker on it which said Factory Inspected, which was covering a large amount of the damage.  The CD's appeared to be ok though and I needed them for a Project at the school I work at so I kept them.  When I played them I soon realized that the play lists were not even close to the ones in the listing.... The following is the correct  listing taken from the box.... additionally the cd's had no labeling on them at all so when  I had to transfer them to a holder I needed to  type up a list ... The factory packaging was large and unwieldy and the CDs were not very safely contained in their slips. They were very difficult to remove and even if the original package had been pristine I probably would not have kept them in it. The extra tape peeled off part of the label of one of my cds.  What I listened to sounded ok, but is nothing special.  There was no particular flow of the music and I am glad I purchased another CD which has a much better mix of tunes from the war years\n\n1.

Please know that I've made no real judgements about the people who have made this music possible. Just know that the title was probaly not a good choice.","6434":"This is such a great love song. I think it will be played at my wedding.","6435":"Not sure how this happened, but I was looking for this song for someone else.  When I clicked on the preview, we both commented \"That doesn't sound live at all\".\n\nWhen I purchased the song, it is definitely live and not the song we had previewed.  This is the first time I can say, I wish I had purchased the song on iTunes.  This version is horrible.","6436":"This book is very inspiring to play for church or just to play at home.  I am enjoying the boook.","6437":"WHY WOULD ANYONE BUY THIS CD, WHEN THE SONGS AREN'T EVEN LISTED?","6438":"Old school hard rock. I can't get enough","6439":"Phenomenal actors! Unfortunately the technical sound quality is less than perfect and is at times distracting.","6440":"Eh","6441":"The Bible tells us something quite differently.  Sure God loves us but we are wicked by nature and are not worthy of his gift of eternal life.  We lie cheat, cheat and steal.  We fornicate, blaspheme and murder. That's worthy?  We deserve hell and it's only by his Grace that those who turn away from their sins and trust in Jesus as their savior will see that eternal life with him.  I understand the sentiment of the song but the theology is just plain wrong.","6442":"Another song that just points to the Lord when you need advice.  He is always there and always hears. He may not answer immediately because that is not always His plan for you.","6443":"I like many songs by Selah, but this has got to be one of my favorite.  I enjoy it immensely.","6444":"This is a powerful song from one of my favorite christian groups. They are wonderful in concert, go see them if you get a chance.","6445":"Really strong bass lines.  This is a southern california reggae band, but they sound very good.  Haven't had a chance to see them live, but I've heard they put on a good show.","6446":"Awesome song for anyone who is wondering why they are on planet earth and who cares. Tells us that we are loved by a great God.","6447":"Listen to this a whole lot. love the sound and the words are very inspirational. Great band and lead singer","6448":"Anything this guy does is a home run....this album is just another example of how great an artist he is.....plus he delivered huge hit singles this time around with the lead song SUNDOWN and of course Care Free Highway.....now on 180 G vinyl....its a welcome addition to my Gordon Lightfoot collection.  Sounds nice in the audiophile world of vinyl!","6449":"I'm a big fan!!! I love his music. He's an created entertainer","6450":"Horrible sound. Horrible.\n\n* * * * *","6451":"Micro is one of my favorite dj's, and If you love his hard trance mixes STEER CLEAR of this album. This is some kind of house\/club mix that sounds like it came off a cheesy, commercial radio, cd. I didn't find a single song I liked.","6452":"Song 1 has a bad spot in it where it sounds like it skips.","6453":"This one was nice, but not really that interesting.","6454":"Miguel Is Strawberry Amazing!!! His work is comparable to Prince, in my humble opinion. I can not wait for more music from him.","6455":"bought this album many years ago. re-bought for old time sake.was good music back in those days. music to listen to if you r a stoner. lol.","6456":"Not what I expected, but it remains loyal to the ZOE 1 universe. I was not aware of this album until i found it on Amazon.\nGive me MORE! I want more of this music.","6457":"Did not like this song","6458":"If you're into house music this is the song to have.","6459":"Mission Executed is a speed\/thrash album from Target, you can are hear a similar music style band's like vendetta,deathrow,iron angel,living death...German speed\/thrash metal\n\nTarget does a very good jobb, they play fast and heavy from start to the end, with thrashy and melodic riifs and with some good solos.\nThe vocal is angry with some high screams here and there typical for this kind of music, but he does a excellent perfomance.\n\nIf you like speed\/thrash metal from the 80's this is a winner\n\nTarget's second album is progressiv and has more technical sound than the debut. The prodction is much better here with a tick and clear sound.\n\nI think there is a good blance between the thrash and the progressiv it all mix very good togheter, its  not to complex and you don't get lost.\n\nThe music is filled with good thrash and technical played. They have slowed it a little down, but some track's has also some good speed to it . They change their vocal and thats very sad because is he was very good, but i think the new vocal suits better to this kind of music, he has clearer voice and he sings very good.\n\nThe frst couple of lissen to this album i was not so impressed so much, it takes some time to really get into it, this is one of those albums that keep growing on you\nNow its one of my favorite Thrash\/speed\/progrsiv album\n\nI recommend this album from Traget to all metal fans.","6460":"Not what I was looking for. I wanted the Cd from the actual movie bc I love the song blackbird. Wasted my money but it was my error.","6461":"Seen this cat back in 99 at a blues bar in Portland ore.  Phenomenal guitar player with some kicking vocals to go with it. Very impressive!  12 years later i found his fire red disc.  Really good production.. by the one and only Mr Eddy Kramer","6462":"I have 25 live lotus shows and this sounds nothing like their live songs.  I almost thought this was maybe a different band.  Don't care for the vocal hip hop stuff","6463":"There are a couple of good songs on this album.  I purchased it to support the band.  Having seen them in concert and after listening to many of their live recordings, I found this album to be a bit of a disappointment.  But, that could be said about many of the bands in this genre.  Seeing them live and in person is the way to go, with listening to a \"live\" recording as the next best. As with most improvisational artists, studio recordings don't always measure how good a band is organ be.  There is something to be said about the symbiotic relationship between musicians and their fans at a concert that you can't quite grasp unless you experience it.","6464":"listen to this album often","6465":"My son's favorite band - he asked me for these CD's when he birthday came around and was so happy when they arrived.","6466":"This song is beyond GORGEOUS...Moving...Classic...and Michael's perfect vocals bathe you in a sense of peace and beauty. This is the kind of song you want to share with EVERYONE because it is a \"gift\" within itself.  Pray'R? Amen! Well done, Mr. Castaldo.  Well done, indeed. Absolutely Wonderful!","6467":"The first time I heard \"Believe,\" I wanted to hear the entire cd. It definitely lived up to my expectations. Beautiful music","6468":"I like the song and Pia's voice sounds great!  There is no denying that she can really sing and sing well!  It will be cool to see what she produces with her debut album!!","6469":"BELLA BELLA BELLA!!","6470":"This is the best song by Conjure One.  I like the music and style of this band.  There are some songs on the album I skip through but \"Pilgrimage\" is really good...my favorite.","6471":"It had a nice beat and it sound real mellow,I would buy the hold album and share it with my friends","6472":"My name is Kylee, which is how I found this. I think I'm exactly like her based on her songs. All her songs are amazing.","6473":"It's a good song.","6474":"Song is just a minute and a half and ends abruprly. Aparently a corrupt music file. Amazon please look into this.","6475":"The MP3 was only 1 minute long, most of the song missing. This needs to be fixed. Please look into this.","6476":"This is not the original. Everything about it looks like it but the songs are not the original cuts!","6477":"Listen closely to the audio samples. You'll hear no dynamic changes, no left hand slurs, no vibrato, and no color changes. Now do an internet search for \"Jordi Morato.\" You'll find he exists only in the bio written by \"Music Studios,\" the company that released this recording.\n\nDraw your own conclusion.\n\nIf you go to the Music Studio web site, you'll find it offers many other recordings like this. These recordings are being peddled all over the internet, including here. Apparently someone thinks this is a clever way to dupe buyers. If you want to pay to hear a computer-generated performance attributed to a non-existent musician, that's your choice. But if you don't like being cheated out of your money, then don't fall for this shameful ploy.","6478":"It's  a  good  song.","6479":"lovely music!","6480":"I love it!","6481":"Wayne Gratz has long been a talented writer of music and arrainger of others popular songs. \"Four Steps to the Ocean\" is a light and breezy walk along the shore. In Florida it is easy to surrender ones self to this style of music as you gaze out upon the Ocean or Gulf watching the water glistening in the sun or reflecting the light of a bright moon as you listen to the surf break upon the shore. This album calls you home again and again.","6482":"I'm not a big fan of hip-hop to begin with. I usually like Christian hip-hop, but this was terrible. Most of the time compilations are well put together, but this one wasn't. I did not like it at all.","6483":"I enjoy Christian Rap but these songs were by various artists and although that can be a good thing sometimes it wasn't on this album. I didn't like it.","6484":"ok","6485":"Volume 2 was definitely better that the first one, however I still did not like it. I would not recommend it unless you are truly in love with Christian hip-hop.","6486":"From the HOINH MySpace page (no, I didn't write this!)\n\nWhat a mixed bag after a few listens to this album. HOINH is a large group, the new wave had some really important records in the past months and weeks. Not enough that these monstrous hits. Let's get in most songs, which you surely know.\nIt is the definition of the new wave of track and eighties-style, \"Hohohoinhho\". A scenario for a man makes her a star and is on her own. And she leaves him? The participation of the dialogue really captures you and the savvy mix of techno keyboards and catchy is legendary. \"This Is A Gun\" is a fairly optimistic number keypad with a touch of ska feeling, but without the horns. The things this group have keyboards, I'll tell ya. \"I Have A Real Feeling\" is a sensitive love song, and has continued in the direction of the new wave of brilliance, but this time R & B master HOINH a rift in the group. The production is a simple mixture of drum machines and light touch of ivory. A classic era of big hair and their second smash ( \"Space And Time Continuhoinh\" is their first). Their next hit here known to the obscure nature, but if you had an eye on MTV and VH1 for about a month or so in 2007, you have to hear this clubby record with a retro feel in ads for shows reality. \"Cyerscheisse\" is very much like \"N For Nerd,\" but the sound is of a Europe that effort updated dance, which is very plausible, but I do not know, it was could be a huge chart hit here.\n\nThey need to know and how these four songs, as I was, and am still, but looked at the rest of the series, and asked: \"Total Hoinh\". Well, the truth is revealed that in this sentence HOINH is really not that the industry is a band, but one of its New-Wave Experiment, worked a few times. The rest of the songs are mostly dark-sounding accounts of love. \"A Fluid In The Light\" trip to Motown \"Karma Chameleon\" (even if this does not come, first served). No one asked for, have they? Trippy request comes as a creepy in \"Banned Electro\" and \"ShakeASpear 4 Shakspeare.\" These early efforts together with \"Das Falche Gebot\" are just terrible and dated. \"Banned Electro\" is so much talk here that you think it was a great political song, but it is so dry and pop, that it feels stale rocky.\n\nThe not big hits are not so bad, but a required taste, you do not expect here. The fun pop hits here, but are very important and very danceable. For the hits, you might want to be this sentence, but the aging of the eighties synth arrangements pull the album. Also, I know it's strange that I want, that imports, but I found it on a trip and had only musically something different from the United Kingdom. Maybe next time I should for something modern.","6487":"This is Volume 1 of the Sing it Down compilations to support SOA Watch. Great songs and powerful voices, Colleen and Jolie Christine make a great album!","6488":"I remember listening to many of he songs that are on this album when I was a single digit old.  Being able to hear Burl Ives once again sing them was a 5 star treat for me.","6489":"I bought this because of the great trumpet music that is in sections of the song, I am seldom so impressed by trumpet music but this was very well done and really makes the song standout. I could not wait to get it so I downloaded the song rather than waiting for the CD to be sent, it makes a great ringtone for the phone. The whole CD is very good and you may want get all the music offered on it.","6490":"big fan of Nindy & RDB in general ! very much liked the song ! Raftaar's vocals are just 1 thing they might have done without as they appear more like scream . apart from that , all cool !","6491":"I absolutely love this song. One of my favorites from this singer. ","6492":"I looked forever for the full version of this song and finally stumbled upon it here.  I love it has both the Goddess and God part to it.  So many songs favor the Goddess but we have Gods too its nice to hear one that encompasses BOTH","6493":"Seriously... I was listening, then suddenly, poop, in my chair, down my legs, just poop.  One of these days I'm sure it'll be exlained, but #yeah, whatever.","6494":"HORRIBLE!!!!! DONT WAST MONEY ON THIS JUNK!","6495":"Millions of musical composers have contributed to our incredibly rich recorded legacy. To me, Josquin rates among the very finest, with Monteverdi, Ssebastian Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and others of this level. Each writes within his historical period, and each surpasses most others known. The performances in this album are simply superb.","6496":"Love","6497":"Love this mans musis","6498":"One of Nadia's newest releases - this is a nice edited version of a great dance song and an amazing beat for a good workout. I love this woman's voice - it just adds a nice dimension to the dance music arena.","6499":"Still one of my favorite songs from either of these guys. Also check out Mind in motion by these two\n\nDoxx + Feint = Eargasm","6500":"I did not research what this CD was about. It is all Techno. Not even good Techno. Just crappy Techno.","6501":"I listened to the excerpt on amazon.com. I bought the mp3. I listened to the entire song. And then I deleted the entire song from my computer.","6502":"I'm surprised that no one else has reviewed this album yet. Both songs are lovely(although you're probably a bit tired of \"In The Sun\" if you are a She & Him junkie). Believe it or not, even though I am a Beach Boys fan, S & H's cover version of \"I Can Hear Music\" has this delightful slower rhythm that seems more appropriate for the mood of this song. I could listen to this on repeat for hours and never get bored with it.","6503":"this cd is mediocre at the very best. the guitars are all muffled and sound the same most of the way though. drums are good tho. i don't like the way the singer yells. i saw buny live their better live than on this cd  thats fer sher. anywayz with all the \"hardcore\" bands coming out  theses dayz itz not easy to rise above and be original. their ok but they  sound just like all the rest for the most part. 1 star.","6504":"A bunch of my friends have this CD and now I finally got it. I can not stop listening to it, it is crazy! I think it is awesome how Buny is starting a new style of music called Death Groove. It will be cool once  they start blowing up spreading True Death Groove worldwide. If you are in  to heavy music that you can jump to then get this now! I love how they have  one singer that screams so insanely and one that sings and raps. My other  favorite bands are Slipknot, Coal Chamber, Korn, etc. Can't wait to see  these boys right up there with them. There is no better!\n-Emilie","6505":"This album from top to bottom is a diverse mix of smooth melodies that provide a unique musical perspective about living in the faith. I think that the sequencing of the songs was on-point and allowed the listener to go through the ebb and flow of the walk that most Christians have. Christon's voice is as smooth as they come and he doesn't \"overdo\" it in any of the tracks. I feel that he is a great blend of what it takes to be a relevant musical voice in the Kingdom.\n\nThis is one of those albums where my \"favorite\" song can change day to day. The first song to lead me to this album long ago was \"Isle of You\", which was a title that caught me initially because of it's play on words (as a poet\/write, I had to dig that). The song was so amazing to me that I do wish that I would've known about it before my wedding - definitely a wedding song! I have to also say, though, that the title track is one of repentance that I can feel every word of. I have so much love for the Fred Hammond original, \"Mender of Broken Hearts\", so much in fact that I would argue that the remake is just as high of quality as the original, which is certainly not always the case.\n\nAfter listening to this for a couple of years, I now have gotten caught up with \"Gray's Conclusion\", which to me is just as transparent as the majority of the album, but is the right summation of who Gray is as an imperfect man, but his effort to be the best that he was created by the Father. Truly, it served as the reiteration of the album's title - almost a continuation of \"Even With Evil With Me\" in it's own way.\n\nFor those who appreciate musical tastes of Jazz, R&B, and just message with the right message, this album is the one to go with. Every project since has been of excellent quality. Keep your ears open for this man of God, because he has something important to share by way of his gift of music.","6506":"beautiful","6507":"Awesome job in Euless Texas last night Bri!  Congrats on your Texas and Nashville success.  Keep on writing!\n\nOh yea, this album has some of her future greatest hits...probably best to buy along with her newer stuff.","6508":"My oldest daughter had to memorize the books of the Bible for a class at church and she was able to memorize it within days. The melody of the song was perfect and I also printed out a list so she could read and sing.","6509":"I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.  IT IS ONLY PART OF A SONG.  I WOULD THINK THAT EVEN FOR 99 CENTS, YOU WOULD GET A WHOLE SONG.  MAYBE I DIDN'T NOTICE WHEN BUYING.  DID IT SAY YOU'D GET ONLY A PART OF THE SONG?  NOT ONLY THAT, THE PORTION OF THE SONG I GOT WAS NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND.  THE BOOKS OF THE BIBLE THAT WERE ON THE CLIP SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENUNCIATED MORE CORRECTLY THAN THEY WERE. ALL IN ALL, NOT A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE AND THIS CLIP WILL NOT BE WORTH PLAYING FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN.","6510":"Angelia Chan sang with beauty and distinction.  The words of the song were sung clearly and the music and the vocalization lifted of the message of Jesus.","6511":"LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!. I sang it to my wife. Very well written by C. Gray. It can be uses as a wedding songz or anniversary songz","6512":"Played on an unusual instrument, this version os Clair De Lune is hauntingly beautiful.","6513":"Everything I order from Amazon is either simple to download or has been shipped on time.  Very satisfied.","6514":"Tom Rust sings this song with emotional depth as though he is living the words and he sings it with technical proficiency.","6515":"Excellent","6516":"Love this song reminds me of my military days. In Fort Dix's . New Jersey","6517":"Very peaceful","6518":"Such an amazing album with many good songs I highly recommend it to any fan of Strike Anywhere or just punk music in general alot of the songs also have good lyrics to back them up with messages which makes it that much better","6519":"Can't say a bad thing about Strike Anywhere or this cd. As a band, they are always thought provoking, fun, intense and overall consistent; you know what you are going to get when you pop in one of their cds and that's always a good thing. After a few years since their last cd, this one was a great return to form. I had high hopes for it and it delivered. It's a great cd that will appeal to new Strike Anywhere listeners, casual fans, die-hard fans and even people that may believe they aren't fans of this type of political fueled punk rock. Bottom line, you can't go wrong with this cd.","6520":"I have to agree entirely with the earlier review by CallMeGod.  The vocalist induces listening fatigue after the third or fourth song due to his whiny nasal and basically boring vocal style.  He seems to have processed the main vocal with his own slightly de-tuned overdubbed back-up vocal )or applied some sort of effect - sounds a bit like Autotune to me), but the end result is essentially harsh, irritating and annoying.  Nothing smooth or 'groove' about it at all.  It could be that the vocal melody line is just too flat all around, and no vocalist could have saved these songs, but whatever the problem is, this CD is a total miss.","6521":"I'm going to have to break off from the other reviews written here.\n\nI have been listening to John Brown's Body (JBB) for a couple of years now, a really big fan of their sound and performance ever since I saw them live.\nFrom such older classics like \"Garden Tree\", \"Feel\" and even to more recent hits like \"Resonate\" and \"Picking Up.\" These songs range from having funky dub, laid back reggae, and all around feel-good music.\n\nUnfortunately I can't say the same for this latest release from the group.\n\"Amplify\" sounds like an all-to-familiar attempt for the band to go more mainstream to bring in more fans. It's almost as they're trying to hard, with songs like \"Amplify,\" with some joker rapper spitting verses towards the end of the song. A rapper? In Jbb? It sounds as bad as it seems.\n\nOn top of this much more mainstream and at some points boring melodies, they also adopt common and overdone vocal lines, evident in \"Push some air.\" Just listen to the first verse, and you'll know what I'm talking about.\nBut not all the songs are complete garbage. The songs I did enjoy were coincidentally the ones that sounded way too similar to previous classics. This is where \"Sky Juice\", \"Give yourself over\", and \"Zion triad\" fit nicely.\nThe rest of the songs fit in the void of a combination of genres that just don't work. Examples are \"So Aware\", which is a failed take of JBB trying to make a love song for teenagers to croon to each other, with the overuse of string instruments. \"Be at peace\" sounds like it was created for a Disney movie like Little Mermaid, when our two heroes fall in love.\n\nBashing aside, I would not recommend this album to any JBB fans who enjoy their more classic sound. \"Amplify\" strays far from the path, infusing more mainstream and gimmick sounding genres.","6522":"For over a decade, the American band John Brown's Body has continued to refine and improve upon their authentic roots reggae sound with each of their previous five releases.  Their new CD `Amplify' contains diverse music that continues to direct this positive vibe in a fresh and exciting direction.  The 12 tracks on this release incorporate a myriad of influences ranging from toasting and psychadelia to dancehall, hip-hop and electronica. The instantly recognizable skank of reggae is still prominent throughout most of the tracks, but that usual format is altered, enhanced and cleverly rewoven into a unique sonic hybrid that almost defies categorization.\n\nElliot Martin, the bands lead singer and front man, possesses a distinctive voice that reveals itself in a multitude of vocalization techniques - powerful intonations and crisp, exact chatting can seamlessly flow into controlled intimacy or combine with his own splendid self-supporting back-up vocals.  His voice, blessed with a warm equalized tone, often is displayed utilizing controlled syllabic fluctuations which would make even the most confident verbalist jealous.  Mr. Martin is also the catalyst behind the well structured and conscious lyrics and he has shown increased confidence in his song craft that was evident on the 2002 release `Spirits All Around Us` and dominated on the excellent 2005 CD `Pressure Points.`\n\n`Speak of the devil' is  a sinister effort built upon a one-drop riddim that warns the listener to be more aware and reconfirms that the righteous shall always prevail regardless of any forms of opposition.  Vaughn Benjamin of the group Midnite contributes a patois-intense vocal towards the end of the track, nicely complimenting the concrete solid dub rhythms.  `Skyjuice,' perhaps the most imposing track on the release, is resplendent with intricately dense horns and tremendous groove-heavy beats from the always impressive drummer Tommy Benedetti.  `Ghost Notes,' infused with a heavy established skanking riff not heard since the days of early Aswad at their finest hour, is a mid-tempo reflective piece that pays due respect to the band's former bass player Scott Palmer, who passed away a few years ago.  The lyrics are poignant and display an ardent compassion seldom found in contemporary song writing.  \" Gave with every note he played, we won't be forgetful. \"\n\nWhile fundamentally faithful to the reggae vibe, John Browns Body creatively weaves rhythms and beats with layered instrumentation that provides a foundation for complex call and response vocals and splendid brass flourishes. The guitar work is tight and circulates amidst a variety of layered keyboard parts that act as a supportive framework throughout the songs.  Throughout the entire disc, innovative dub-friendly basslines enjoy enlightened interplay with crisp, bouncy drum beats.\n\nThe inclusion of exotic instrumentation such as the kora and violin take the galloping track `So Aware' outside the traditional reggae parameters to a subtle, worldly flavor echoing stylistic integrations used by North African Rai musicians.  Another contributing ingredient to the entire John Brown's Body sound are the exception production techniques that meticulously meld the surfeit of rhythms and beats with rich instrumentation, detailed harmonization and an enveloping use of atmosphere.  The editing is stellar and the expressive arrangements are complete with unexpected twists.  Live soundman and studio producer Jason `Jocko' Randall polishes the bands current creations enhancing the cross pollination of numerous musical rhythmic styles.  The result is a new style of music that possesses a vibe always loyal to the mystic, earthly tones of roots reggae while being inventive, groove-heavy and cool.\n\nJohn Brown's Body have established themselves as perhaps America's most creative and dedicated reggae ensemble.  On `Amplify,' the latest incarnation of the band successfully executes a variety of moods that are ambitious and vibrantly experimental.  With the addition of new band members, Elliot Martin and Tommy Benedetti have embraced a new found sense of purpose and delivered a collection of compositions slightly ahead of its time. The music and lyrics demand that the listener's brain multitask to appreciate the sophisticated textures and depth of arrangements.  However you describe this music: groove music with reggae overtones or dubby electronica fusion roots, the final result is energetic, very original and ultimately impressive.","6523":"This is a wonderful collection of orchestrated Satie with some extraneous electronic adaptions which sometimes gets in the way.  I am constantly on the look for a CD copy of this record, but, alas, it, as yet, doesn't exist in that format.","6524":"I purchased this tune to add to a family slide show of pictures (using Muvee software) that I'm creating as a gift for my mother who has dementia.  I planned to burn the slide show to a DVD.  I'm very disappointed that when I attempted to add this song to the slide show, I received an error message so I cannot use it.  Not sure if the error message is due to a download problem. It did not cost much in terms of money but it did take a lot of time to pick out just the right song. I'm just unhappy that I wasted so much time and  don't have enough time to figure out what went wrong or how to correct it.","6525":"One star for misleading customers into thinking this might be original music. It is not and though it might be technically acceptable, it is missing the original art which made the song what it is.\nIt's disgusting how prevalent this deceit is!","6526":"ok","6527":"Wow David Tennant can sing, who knew - the pairing between him and Catherine Tate is superb, and funning and really good. Miss Tate has a beautiful voice and the better one. If you like Dr Who - Doctor\/Donna - you will love this - if you liked \"Much ado about nothing\" you will love this.","6528":"My kids watch the show, and I often see it with them. I like the show - it's cute.\n\nThis song however ... eh. The chorus is kind of catchy, but the verses are blah musically and don't go anywhere.\n\nThe lyrics ... well, about as intelligent as any dance song. And could easily be interpreted to be racy (which I don't like, for my kids) but are just ambiguous enough to be deniable.","6529":"ahaha best, i don't know why i keep listening to this, but its very catchy song","6530":"didn't like this version","6531":"When I typed \"Every Praise\" by Hezekiah Walker into my browser, this is what comes up. This IS NOT Hezekiah Walker!","6532":"This is a great praise and worship song.  It's got a catchy tune, simple words, and compels the listener to sing along with a big smile.  Love it, love it, love it!","6533":"Outstanding \"Orphans\" as usual.","6534":"As another reviewer pointed out, the volume is inconsistent. One song will be so quiet we can't hear it and the next is so loud that it wakes the baby. I haven't listened to all of the songs yet because the volume issue is so frustrating. I was very excited to find classical lullabies at such a great price, but this album is worthless to me.","6535":"No matter the volume, the music of Rancho Relaxo doesnt rise from your speakers, it ebbs and flows, like some thick sonic liquid, barely viscus, pushing and swirling its way into your room, hovering at floor level, then rising up the walls before spilling back down onto itself ... all the while you sit there, eyes glazed, afraid to move, afraid to break the trance, afraid to make any motion that would spur you from the delightful ether laden musical adventure.\n\nThis band who hale from Norway, have learned from the best, memorizing with Americana guitar jangles, eastern sitar influences, tambourine trances, and its all held in place by a mystic backbeat thats as primal as it is etherial ... instantly bringing to mind work done by The Beatles on Revolver, not to mention Brian Jonestown.  Yet they do it all without sounding beholding, or under the influence of anyone, delivering a sound thats as dark as night, and surely suitable for any out of body experience you could conjure.\n\nMy recommendations [?] ...\n-If you don't have one, purchase an Oriental rug ...\n-Candles, along with a Lava Lamp to light your way ...\n-Heavy Victorian Curtains to block the sun ...\n-And finally, a comfortable place to sit, where you can be absorbed by the music ...\n\nPlease ... send me a postcard when you get back, I love to hear about your trip.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","6536":"This is just an amazing version of this song.  The original Offspring version is one of my favorite songs of theirs, and I like this version just as much if not better than the original.","6537":"Great new artist, great new album. You won't regret this purchase. I love most of the songs on the album. I expect we'll be seeing a lot more of this artist in the future.","6538":"if you want this album, (which you should because it's good) just buy top of the world and the halo nova song.\nthen you can buy the \"best of 2011\" album and get all the other songs in it plus 15 more for only like 2 more dollars!","6539":"Second best album I've heard in recent years only behind Tear Down the World by We are the Fallen.","6540":"If you liked VoB's album Le Funk the most, there is nothing for you here. If you liked Night On Fire, again, next to nothing for you. Bring on the Comets? The final track, Over - which doesn't fit in with the rest of the album's cold, calculated dance beats - may appeal to you. Overall there a a hand full of ok songs on this album (All Summer in A Day is pretty good), but it mostly just doesn't feel like a VHS or Beta album. Very, very few guitars. They've completely abandoned their full band sound in favor of a sound somewhere between a gutless version of the presets and a less smooth version of the junior boys. I consider VoB one of my favorite bands, but the road they've chosen to travel (while I respect their right to do so) is one I will not be following them down.","6541":"This album was alright.  I guess the first song was pretty good. After that I stopped paying attention.  These guys are no Foster the People.  Now that's some REAL music!","6542":"I heard this amazing lady sing in person last night.  She has a beautiful, clear voice - one you could listen to for hours.  The few songs I've heard from the album were excellent - I've no doubt the entire thing is fabulous.","6543":"Mexican prog rock,this is where it's happening folks. These guys have a mixture of Symphony X, Dream Theater ,and a mix of Old Kamelot. Really good singer,formerly of Tercer Acto. I could only obtain the MP3 version,but hope to get all their CDs,this will happen when I can travel into Mexico again. All musicians are good,no surplus musicians,gelled very well in a well oiled machine. I recommend if you are into the afore mentioned groups.","6544":"Do some research on this song, it is so beautiful, yet tragic also. This is one of my all-time favorites. God is the Great Lighthouse that brightly beams across the dark sea of humanity, and He guides them to the entrance of the harbor, yet WE are the keepers of the lesser lights on the shore that help guide lost souls in their final journey to safety, thus WE must keep our lights burning brightly lest they crash and break up on the rocks.","6545":"Love this music.","6546":"Disappointed","6547":"The single is good but the album as a whole was not very good. Wish I didn't buy it, feels like a waste of money.","6548":"This set contains three CDs; the sound quality varies wildly among them. The second CD has good sound quality; nothing special, but good. The first CD has okay sound quality, although it sounds rather flat. The third CD, however, has abysmal sound quality; rather than \"recorded live\", it sounds as if someone recorded it with their cell phone during a concert and then made bootleg copies off that recording. Guevara's voice is often lost in the background; the piano is loud but the quality of the sound is bad; spoken words can barely be understood.  This is simply unacceptable in what is sold as a professionally produced CD. Save your money, and don't buy the set.","6549":"I ordered this set expecting Dick Bartley. However, I got Dick Clark instead. It was a 6 CD set, but a completely different one than advertised.","6550":"It's hard to believe that it's going to be eight years since I walked into a Borders and first heard Marina. Like my favorite song, her latest CD My Star is Simple Magick. Within Marina's music you sense the strength, character and intensity, which come from her soulful sprit. Yet there is the vulnerability of a fragile soul there, that makes you want to enfold her in your arms and tell her everything will be fine. Marina's music will skillfully take you through the range of human emotions.\n\nAnd she just keeps getting better and better. You won't be disappointed.","6551":"Well, if you're a The Police fan and you like to hear classic tunes on a new dimension don't loose the opportunity to hear that fantastic CD.","6552":"Love it !!!!","6553":"It is not explcit!","6554":"trust fund baby zinn tird! move on for real blues. Not this!","6555":"Great Album!!!","6556":"very bad. why? because its very bad.","6557":"Thought I was buying a cd","6558":"Amazing song. Need I say more?","6559":"McKay and Co have done a great job with this CD. It has lots of guitars and I find myself humming the songs after they've finished playing. Definitely worth buying, and I'm glad i bought the entire album instead of just a song or two. The singing can be a little hard to understand, but that hasn't stopped a lot of musicians. Great album, can't wait for more.\n\nAs for the \"explicit\" label, there is one word in one song. Jeez.","6560":"I have no idea how authentically \"Arabic\" any of these songs are, and I don't really care, but this is by far my favorite downtime compilation of all time. If these were albums, I'd have worn them out.","6561":"Perfect for both my kids, 5 and 10 years old.  My kindergartener learned a lot about various presidents in preparation for Presidents' Day. My 10 yo already had a placemat with all the presidents. So there'd been a lot of talk and quizzing each other about presidents.  So I searched for a song to teach them the order, found several, but they both like hip-hop\/rap, and even I (who usually does not) found this to be the catchiest tune out there!","6562":"I already own One Spark, but I bought the EP for the two songs that aren't on that album.  Definitely worth the purchase to get Things That Move Me and, especially, Change.  Gabe Dixon is the best singer\/songwriter around these days. He makes the kind of music you can listen to for years!","6563":"One of the most beautiful Queen love songs ever! Freddie Mercury's vocals are just amazing!!","6564":"No More Invitations is one of the best cds I have ever heard. Jennifer's voice is silky smooth and I love every song on there. I absolutely love \"Follows Me Still\" and \"Chapter You\" is amazing...such a folksy and warm sound to her voice that wraps around you like a warm blanket on a winter's night. I have to say my favorite (which was very hard to pick) is \"3000 Miles\"... So soulful and really touched my heart. Thank you, Jennifer Haase, for sharing your wonderful talent.\nI guarantee that if you buy this cd, it will immediately become your favorite...in fact, I would recommend buying 2, so you have an extra when you wear out the first one!","6565":"Wonderful arrangements on \"Jet Plane,\" \"Time After Time,\" and \"La Vie En Rose.\"  To enjoy alone or with a few good friends!","6566":"Despite the order in which I listen to them, the tracks on this album just get better and better. The only explanation I can offer is that this music is possessed. My own bone-headed skeleton argues otherwise though. Maybe a rusty shovel would knock some sense into him (?) Ric Bauer Kissimmee FL","6567":"My bird ignored it and could care less.","6568":"I don't have a computer in my birds room I have a cd player. I wanted these hard copy. I do not download from my computer. I am not equipped\ncant someone help me. all I want is the hard copy cd","6569":"We use this for my daughters bedtime. Very calming track!","6570":"Great song by Pearcy. Sounds like a song that could have been on RATTS last album Infestation.","6571":"badass country rap song alots of bass","6572":"Unusual combination country\/rap but it sounds good on the sub in the 4x4. It hits pretty hard.\nGood when cruising by the lake or Muddin.","6573":"FYI: THIS IS A BOOTLEG!  _  There is an OFFICIAL \"Tales From the Darkside\"; but it is NOT this item (pictured above, with band members on cover).  _  The official one, is actually a \"Sober\" EP Maxi-Single, made in Holland (an import), and has the same artwork as most of the other \"Sober\" EPs (a gray man's head\/torso, with hand pointing, set to a murky\/smokey background -- blue, gray colored cover; and has a proper, \"pressed\" disc... NOT a CD-R... Comes in a slimline max-single case, NOT a standard \"jewel case\" with square \"artwork\" (if what's shown can be considered artwork). __ PS: You can buy the OFFICIAL one elsewhere for well under $20, as it is not too rare or highly sought after.","6574":"Sounds  good","6575":"Very nice rhythm .. Beat will keep you moving","6576":"Can't go wrong with a digital song that you like. Of course the quality is good and I like the song very much.","6577":"Morgan Page.. need I say more?  Im feelin it!","6578":"i love that this cd play the same song over and over in different beats. to me it's worth buying","6579":"great rare find from Randy,from\"leave the bridges standing\" to,\"if I don't love you\" my perennial favorite.this is truly the talk of the town by my man Randy Brown!  ty b","6580":"Might have  been nice to have the phrases translated after they were spoken. Not worth the money nor the time.","6581":"I want more! I saw him live at the Cowboy Symposium in Ruidoso, NM. He has a wonderful voice and Texas Swing is the greatest.","6582":"Crappy quality","6583":"Terrible","6584":"His voice is melodic, the harmony is just beautiful.  If you've ever heard Prince sing Avalanche, the chorus is layered and beautiful, this has those same lush overdubes.  This song by B.Slade is worth the money. What a beautiful song. A piece of soul Jazz that is just a stand out even today.","6585":"Everytime I turn this song on it brings all the feels!\n\nLovely lyrics, great instrumentals. My favorite break up song from Luke.","6586":"coubtry","6587":"Corny Country Love Song","6588":"Great buy!","6589":"One of my husbands favorite country singer. He sings this song to me when we get sometime alone on a date :)","6590":"5*","6591":"Both the UK and USA Amazon listings state ONE (1) disc but supposedly 4 albums, which originally were quite good...............\nSo, what do we have here?","6592":"looked for John Parr's hits after seeing the running man and on the radio .checked out some music clubs , found nothing. went on Amazon and found what i was looking for and ordered it. loved it and ordered another album .","6593":"Love this CD such a blessing.","6594":"Love this guy, love this song.  Using it as a theme for our Sunday School closing program!","6595":"Fantastic song","6596":"This is an awesome song with an awesome message!!! We need more music like this in the world, it would make it a much better place to live in!!!","6597":"i want a refund but i cant figure out how to get one! paying almost a buck for 30 seconds of a track is not cool.","6598":"I must say I'm not always a fan of Cee-Lo but he kills it on this song.  The rap game now is full of copycats and repetitive songs most the time.  However Bright Lights Bigger City does not fall into this cateogory.  It is original and evokes great feeling, Cee-Lo paints a great picture in this song.","6599":"I did not realize it was the karaoke version. Half the words missing. Now I can't even get it off my kindle. Stop making\nthese things!","6600":"Terrible quality! Hack job audio with vocals still present and scratchy. I can't believe this is even on Amazon. Crazy.","6601":"If you like Adam Levine's voice - go ahead and get this, but you can not hear half of the rest of the lyrics!!","6602":"Love this song and the haunting quality that Sting's voice gives it. Amazing!","6603":"I love this song!","6604":"An amazing collection. I would give it 6 stars if I could.","6605":"Ok, it would be hard for anyone to cover this Britney Spears hit with any success, but Klein is especially ill suited to the task, probably because she's north of 35 and this is teeny bopper territory not meant to be tread by a brainy Jewish songstress.","6606":"Awesome album, some real KebMo! I love this album as much as I loved  his first two albums.  I recommend it!","6607":"It just didn't have that 'feeling'. It lacked heart.","6608":"New Found Glory never really age do they?  They've been around for awhile.  I can't act like I was there from the beginning but I am definitely glad I have started listening to them in the last few years.  This is a great happy, summer disc.  Bethany Cosentino was a great addition to Caught in the Act as her and Jordan's voice blend nicely. It's hard to pick out songs that are better than others because nearly every song has a chorus that'll have you hooked and singing along.  Good release and lucky for us they aren't done yet","6609":"Nice","6610":"this was not downloaded.  it is not on my computer, and I don't know why, since I have downloaded many times","6611":"this download  failed and I do not know why; since I have downloaded many items many times.  I should not be charged for this.","6612":"this is a smooth song one of the best of sades music I have ever heard","6613":"This is an hour of calm, relaxing, Tibetan bells.  It's meditative but not trance-y. Not like some of the new age garbage that everybody associates with meditation. I used this to teach a restorative yoga class, and my students actually commented on how much they loved the music. I love it, too, so I guess I did a good job buying it!\n\nP.S. It's more expensive if you buy it on iTunes. Almost twice the price!","6614":"She sounds better in this song, but she just talks about herself - which shows what a vain, spoiled, and, greedy girl she is. I hated Friday but I hate this song just as much.","6615":"Rebecca Black's follow up to ear shattering ... uh EARTH shattering musical classic \"Friday\" is nothing short of a historic masterpiece.  La Black's vocals rival the sounds of a flock of crows picking over discarded garbage.  The video is like being on a jury of a murder trial and having to look at graphic photos slaughtered victims.\n\nCould we please stick our leaders in Washington DC into a room and force them to listen to this?","6616":"When it has came down to Rebecca Black, she definitely has honestly the worst debut song in the world with Friday. It was just so awful, I felt like I wanted to just vomit all over. Here latest single, My Moment though takes it a step almost at par, but fares at a bogey with her showing she could sing, but just chose not to do it well in the first place. It at least is a better attempt from Rebecca musically, that she could sing, by not being a flat-head. Still, I just honestly don't know if Rebecca will release a full-length record anytime soon, but this song surely shows it is not her moment and just a novelty act.\n\nSong: D+","6617":"Read my other reviews to see how I feel about (Rebecca) Black Friday. Since then, she appeared in Katy Perry's hysterical TGIF video where she cemented what I've felt all along. She's a talented, adorable, bankable TV star who should get a series built around her on Nickelodeon or Disney Channel ASAP.\n\nI was hoping for much more on this second effort. They did a nice job toning down the Auto-Tune. The real problem is the arrangement. Sounding like it was produced on a 2003 Sony VAIO, the rhythm lurches around like a warped 7-inch of Debbie Gibson's Out of the Blue. Where Friday wormed its way into the pop culture canon with a winning combination of iCarly and MMMbop, this song is \"all about the Becca'mins\" and nothing to do with the things her audience can identify with (or dance to at Junior Prom). Perhaps it can be covered as American Idol's obligatory, abysmal coronation song in 2012.\n\nHere's hoping we see much more Black on the TV or Silver Screen soon.","6618":"I love naked and some of his other music. He really know how to put you in the mood to chill out and enjoy.","6619":"I love this album and was expecting all six songs to be on the vinyl and was sadly disappointed. THE VINYL DOESNT INCLUDE VULTURES LIKE LOVERS AND ASLEEP it only has FOUR TRACKS. I sent it back because of this flaw but otherwise, if you are ok with only 4\/6 tracks then I suggest getting it.","6620":"If you are a Mellencamp fan, which I am, this is all the hits. I like is it when I can get all the  hits in one download","6621":"Another Blue Bird double LP.  Great standards wonderfully played by Artie and band.  The originals are also forward moving and very good.  Thanks Amazon.","6622":"This is the greatest collection of drinking songs every assembled, period.  Oscar Brand is accompanied on banjo and vocals by Erik Darling (of Weavers and Rooftop Singer fame).  Darling's banjo is the perfect counterpoint for Oscar's 12-string guitar.  There's not a false note on this LP.  Sadly, it was never released on CD (although Oscar made a variant of it about ten years ago called \"100-Proof Drinking Songs,\"--good, but not great. It is, however, still available, and well worth a listen.)","6623":"This version's lead is not the original voice, as sang so many years ago.  At least to my ear, this is not the original.","6624":"Best $13 dollars I've ever spent","6625":"I really like this music, it is perfect for doing Qigong, Tai Chi and meditation. Often Qigogng music has too much singing bowls or dinging for me, while this does have some chiming, it's a perfect mix. I am very satisfied with this music.","6626":"This is a beautiful recording of inspirational and calming music.  I like that the songs are by different artists, some male, some female and some both.  It creates a varied and lovely sound. You can really feel God's tender love.","6627":"The sound quality is a little harsh in this recording.  I think the playing is well done, but falls short in the listening due to the sound quality.","6628":"Love the music, love the Amazon music app","6629":"wonderful song....the remaster is very clean.  worth the purchase for sure.","6630":"I'm really sorry, but I cannot give this record more stars. I am a great fan of Klaatu, but Dee Long's new versions are so flat, so boring and lifeless that I ask myself why he has done this. He should have gone for his own songs and left the Klaatu songs Klaatu songs.\nUnfortunately these reissued Klaatu songs lack the brilliance and the passion of the original versions. The drums are absolutely boring and there are hardly any peaks anymore.\nMy advice is: listen to the original Klaatu songs: they go off like a rocket!","6631":"Dee Long is a great guitar player and his playing shines through on this CD. A mix of Dee's solo stuff and remakes of some of his Klaatu gems like Hanus of Uranus which he rips up. If it's possible, his remake is better than the original... and that is saying a lot... the original was a fantastic rocker. I thoroughly enjoyed this album.","6632":"Awesome guitar playing mexica version of incubus!","6633":"This is a great release from Scientific Map. I have been listening to Rust Belt Soul for weeks and each time I hear something new. It's obvious the five members are extremely talented: the technique is rock solid (even stunning), the solos are inventive and purposeful, the vocals are honest and potent, and the songwriting is nothing short of admirable. I've been converted to Rust Belt Soul, and if you give it a listen, I think you will be, too.","6634":"These tracks are great.  Much easier than using any kind of timer, even a good interval timer.  The music is kind of repetetive, but for this application, I think that's best--they really stay in the backgroud while being a lot more fun than silence.  If I had to listen to them for a long time, I'm sure they'd get monotonous, but Tabata workouts are, by design, short.  The coaching on the coaching tracks is super cheesy, but you only need to listen to that a couple of times before you can take your cues simply from the music.  If you want the easiest possible (not a single extra piece of equipment and cheap!) option to guide you through Tabata workouts, these are exactly what you need.","6635":"SHlT sandwich.","6636":"Great assortment of musical selections, but they all have a MIDI sound to them. All synthetic sounding, not original scores.","6637":"This is not Tennessee Ernie Ford COUNTRY MORNING 1973 ALBUM ..I was very disappointed.","6638":"NEVER BUY A PRODUCT OF THIS CLASS NON NINGUMA INDICATE THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN EACH CD.\nSECURITIES CLASS MUSIC, UNACCEPTABLE\nI HAVE INDICATED ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS AND DEAF EARS.\n\nJULIAN GRANADINO GUERRA\nCOLLADO VILLALBA  - MADRID\nSPAIN","6639":"Mastertrax is the best in Background tracks. Buying on Amazon is easy and saves money.  I will be singing this in Church next Sunday.","6640":"It is just the music. You can hardly hear the background vocals. It wasn't what I expected at all. Thought I would be able to hear some harmonies, but it is difficult to pick out.","6641":"The download was terrible! skips , this isn't the original song version I was after. Must have been recorded at a different time.","6642":"Great artist great music! Definitely buy this artist everything she does. You won't be dissapointed. Next chance you get give this artist a listen on amazon","6643":"same as the other download, doesn't even sound like david houstion -where did you get this recording??? not original recording","6644":"Same as the other two I downloaded. this version is really bad, couldn't hardly tell it was david Houston singing","6645":"The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was that the songs tended to sound too similar. While that wasn't \"bad\" I felt it held the overall CD back. I liked Prey for Eyes and Clients more.","6646":"in other words: don't trust any review but mine.\n\nTHIS CD SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE CLIENTS!\ni didn't BUY the last cd, but from the few songs i heard off it, i could tell Red Chord had gone in a completely different direction but still kicked ass. that cd must've been ill received because they've clearly reverted back to the production and sound of Clients here.\n\nsongs 1 and 2 of FTtTM are amAzing. i had my hands up in the air the whole time i listened to 'em in a \"jesus, it's so brutal i can't take it!\" sort of gesture. i was blown away by the deep peculiar balance of brutality and despair therein. i was TOUCHED.\n\nand then i heard every other song. from songs 3 to 12, Brad Fickeisen uses roughly 3 beats (i'm being reductive on purpose. that was the IMPRESSION i got (that there were no more than 3 beats used), and impressions are worth as much as truth in art, damn it); the riffs become a LOT less interesting; and the vocals are the same throughout (and haven't changed much since Clients, so i'm not blaming Guy too much here).\n\nthe lyrics are choppy and at times sappy. \"Face Area Solution\" is a sensitive jam, entreating women (or people in general) not to get facial reconstructive surgery. the singing's BRUTAL in the song, but the nice and considerate lyrics clash too violently, methinks, with that brutality. the rest of the lyrics are just too vague. vocals nevertheless sound good (if not a tad too unchanging).\n\non a last and hugely all-refuting note:\nsongs 1 and 2 are so good they're almost worth the 5-12 bucks you'll pay for this cd.","6647":"This artist is incredible! The sound production is incredible! Delooze, and the record label \"Gash Digital\" are producing some of the best beats today, period. This album, along with other Gash Digital releases have strong Deep French house influences (my favorite). Delooze is definitely an artist to keep an eye on. Supposedly she is releasing her first full length debut album soon! I'll be impatiently waiting for it. However, This album is absurdly good. The remixes are well worth the money, and each one is DISTINCTLY different from one another, and they all sound incredible. Buy it! Support Delooze! and this sort of music!! I hope she comes to the States, West Coast, LA :)","6648":"ok","6649":"Love the music! Soft and easy to listen tol","6650":"Great variety of many ukulele artists. Will encourage a friend whose granddaughter on Maui just started taking lessons to order a copy for the child.","6651":"Play at your own risk!!!","6652":"I got this for a friend so I didn't listen to it and not my kind of music.","6653":"Lovely","6654":"I rely on hypnosis tracks to go to sleep.  I am also an avid lucid dream participant.  When I got bored of listening to the same two (reliable) hypnosis tracks, I ventured out to seek something better.  I bought this album because of the 5 star review that the other user wrote and was enthusiastic to use it the same night I purchased it.  What could go wrong with a hypnosis album meant for lucid dreaming?\n\nI am not saying entirely that this album is bad. There are good points that I would like to point out. First of all, the script used is very well thought out. The trancey binaural tones in the background are flawless for the purpose of each track.  Unfortunately, all this effort goes to waste with poor mixing.  When the narrator's voice comes in quite suddenly, it is several decibels higher than these tones, causing you to jerk out of that trancey state.  After several failures from almost achieving a wake induced dream state, I began seeing horrifying distorted images of faces in my closed-eye visuals. So what went from a blissful state quickly turned into a nightmare until it was so unbearable I had to open my eyes.\n\nI gave the album a few more tries the following days, but again, I was jerked out of the trancey state and was never able to fall asleep. I don't recommend purchasing this album.  I am not discrediting the usefulness of hypnosis tracks, nor am I discouraging people from trying to achieve a lucid dream. I am a firm believer of said two things, but this album is not what you want.","6655":"I did not order this","6656":"Incredibly bad recording (worse than my old vinyl) made this intolerable to listen to. The fact that there were only 6 songs on it makes it a ripoff!!","6657":"My family and I listened to this album many, many times  when we were very young.  I am VERY disappointed that the whole album is not on this compact disc.","6658":"I grew up listening to this actual vinyl album at my Grandparents house. When they passed, I inherited the album. It is the only version I have ever heard. Therefore when I got this CD in the mail yesterday (after years of looking for it) I was super thrilled. The first thing I realized was that it is missing several tracks from the album (including 2 of my favorites). And yes, I now see that next to the title it says six songs, and they are making their own compilations (as I also now see in the description \"CD-R Note: This product is manufactured on demand when ordered from Amazon.com\".) So basically, they are burning their own CD's as they are ordered. I really do not care that they are producing them, but please do not put an album cover on the product that NONE of the versions are from. It is misleading. I am 100% positive these are not the versions from the original album. Sarah Jackman's phone number on the original album is 418-9749. On this version it is 418-2792. Not that I am saying these versions aren't funny, just that I wanted the original versions from the original album. It looks like I am going to wind up converting a few of my Grandparents albums (Pat Cooper, Lou Monte, etc.) that you cannot get on CD myself. If you are not concerned with having the exact album versions, then this is fine. He is funny no matter what, but I was looking for the CD version of the ORIGINAL album.","6659":"This version is not the same for two reasons.  It is only six songs out of 10 or so on the original as the title says if you bother to read the parens.  Some really great songs missing!  Also, to make matters worst, part of what made this album one of the best selling comedy albums of its day was the venue -- some kind of party with lots of cognoscenti (i.e., Jews from Brooklyn and ladies of Hadassah) who laughed and laughed and laughed some more.  It is really a sham for Amazon to sell this product with the same name and cover as the original.  I have not written a review of any kind for about 3 years, so congrats Amazon, you got me going with this on.  Not Allan's best.  Incomplete.  Not the original.","6660":"It's a great song, my family comes from Kilmartin, northwest of Glasgow. I'm impressed as to how influential the Late, Late Show is.","6661":"Not the song I wanted","6662":"really good track i enjoy this song and it was worth the buy really wanna hear the rest of the ablum","6663":"I love every song Justin Hines has recorded.  He sings them from his heart\nand they relate to things we've all gone through at some time in our lives.\nYoung or old, I think you will enjoy Justin Hines very much.","6664":"Didn't buy it because it is not even 2 minutes long, including the free sample.  What kind of person buys this stuff?","6665":"Perfect.","6666":"Nice recording!","6667":"I first heard \"Nuttin Nuh go so\" by Notch on satellite radio station, and found the album here and purchased it, without doing enough time listening to the samples.\n\nSo, now I know that Riddim means the exact same beat for every song.  Not sure why this would be popular, because after 3 or 4 songs, I was \"what the heck?...\" and finding another album on my ipod.\n\nIf you like the exact same beat over and over and over (and over and over....), then you might like this.  Now I know, and won't buy another in this format. Find one or two songs you like and just buy those tracks.","6668":"I'm totally a NCIS fan and I didn't know paully sang and its so inspirational. I listen to this right before a test and i have bad test anxiety, really bad even though I study but I aced it it gave me the confidence I needed to succeed.

Jones CD.","6672":"Wanted to own a CD but settled for MP3, this is a great and like it says soothing hour of music","6673":"On the plus side, he is easy to understand, with a clear pleasant voice\n\nnegative- I found the intro discribing what hypnosis is and factors involving it far too long,if I did use it I would get pretty annoyed at 3+ min of explaination each time I was to listen to the recording\n-his induction is far too fast for me to relax and go into a hypnotic state\n-a sales pitch at the end.","6674":"Beautiful","6675":"DON'T LET THE MODERN DESIGN OF THE COVER FOOL YOU!\n\nI just bought this and I'm so disappointed! It sounds like it was taken from a recording 60 yrs old or more. It's very poor quality - scratchy sounding - and cheesy.","6676":"This album rocks!","6677":"Definitely BORING!\nWhere is the brasilian sound of Chico Buarque we all know?\nThe songs in this CD are so slow... and they all sound the same way...","6678":"Chico Buarque owes nothing to anyone--at least, this is true musically.  He has written some of the finest songs to come out of Brazil in the last 50 years.  Chico has synthesized multiples of cultures,untraditional harmonies and classical forms.  His lyric writing has been politically astute and, at times, carefully evasive.  And when writing of romance, myth, or social malaise, he has been acutely intelligent--without pandering to any school or transient phase.  And this doesn't even take into consideration his plays, ballets, novels, and commentary.\n\nSadly, he has not produced much affecting music in the last 20 years (\"Dois Irmaos\" of 1990 is his last worthy effort).  This cd, like his last four or five albums, is an extrusion of meandering melodies and earnest, but uninteresting chord progressions (still--some very nice open-string harmonies). My Portuguese is not as good as it should be, so I don't think I amcomfortable judging his \"letras.\" I look forward to a fair assessment from another of his admirers (there are legions, justifiably so).\n\nI will always purchase Chico cd;s because his worst efforts exceed almost anything produced in the pop vein outside of Brazil.  But this one is not memorable.  \"O Quw Sera\" is the apogee of Chico's work.  I don't know if he is capable of reaching that height anymore.","6679":"They were on Metal Massacre 7 with Heretic and the Mighty Flotsom and Jetsom. It was awesome cause that album had two female singers Sentinal Beast and Detente both release great albums after that release. This album is great metal.. I'm glad I finally found it after all these years.","6680":"This is probably one of my favorite thrash metal albums to come out from the 80's. It's similar to early maiden, think \"killers\", but with a bit more speed and a female vocalist. Every chorus is infectious and is sure to get stuck in your head.","6681":"I did Irish Dancing for two years and, this music bring back many fond memories. The beat and instruments work perfectly together.","6682":"This song empowers girls (and boys) to see the inner beauty we all possess.  Soaring vocals, backed by powerful musicianship.","6683":"The CD was returned because it was blank (there was nothing on it).","6684":"I love this book.  It's an old one but it is a great self help book.","6685":"Doesn't play","6686":"cD did not work and took a very long time to arrive :\/ not happy with the purchase","6687":"Be careful when buying music from Amazon on line a lot of the music is not the original artists. I found out the hard way and stuck with this piece of s***, its so bad it should be illegal to sell in the USA.","6688":"This is probably best described as strange jazz.  Strange in the sense that it is prefaced and laced through with the baying of wolves in the distance, then incorporates lonely sax, guitars, strings, and so on into moody jazz...Yes, it is offbeat, but I have used a couple of tracks on my jazz show on 'listentothecat'...it got its fourth star from me on the basis of weirdness, rather than musicality, but it appeals to my bizarre taste...okay, the truth is this was an album my brother bought and I inheireted, and he was really rather strange.  Can't help it...I like it.","6689":"trash music","6690":"trash music","6691":"trash musictrash music","6692":"I think it's about dying stars and planets but as it's Death Metal, I can't understand a single word.  Keeps students on their toes, though.","6693":"reediting nightmare. people thought putting their voices in to a great album would make it sound better. a regretful buy :(","6694":"not what I was looking for.  The droning background is too new-agey and not well-mixed.  frequently the spacey keyboard is (not on purpose) much louder than the solo oud sound.  I don't think the two sounds are a good match together.","6695":"trash music","6696":"trash music","6697":"I bought this track from 3 different online kiosks... All of them have the same skips and errors in the encode. You can listen to a clean version on Youtube, however. I believe the publisher isn't paying attention to what it is distributing. Too bad, because the track is fantastic.","6698":"The Latin music scene has been a bit monotonous for the past couple of years. For some reason they all sound the same and we are kind of tired of Shakira an Juanes. Thank god Flor Amargo came along! I haven't heard anything so fresh, so powerful in a long long time. It has the most intersting mix of sounds, that take you from pop to electronic to pure and simple rock and even a touch of cabaret and burlesque.\nThis is a very interesting CD and I could say that at least 9 of the 10 songs are amazing. She is a very powerful performer.\nI am glad we now have a new artist to look after. Welcome Flor Amargo.","6699":"This song is from Rollerblue's first album Homecoming (cocals by Jill Riddiford). Its a sensational entree to soft rock with an up tempo beat. The song is amazingly fresh and pulls you in on every beat. I haven't stopped playing the album - its my current favorite. If you are building a library of contemporary pop rock music,  then Homecoming is a must for any collector.","6700":"Good quailty nice sound enjoyable to listen to. Glad i purchased this song.

Just as one doesn't have to be Christian or even religious to appreciate John Dunne or any number of poets, this paean to the mother of Jesus stirs the soul.","6706":"A good party song for good parties.","6707":"GREAT DEAL FOR THOSE WHO LIKE METAL A TOTAL OF 50 SONGS WOW !!!","6708":"If you don't like this band, you're friggin idiot...i'm contemplating on getting a FATAL VISION tat across my back!

It's an old song but I still love it.","6726":"We saw Matt in Flagstaff and he is awesome.  Anyone that has the opportunity to see him in concert shold go.  You won't regret it.","6727":"The rating doesn't not in any way reflect on the merits of Nazareth's output--it only examines this specific product. This seems to good to be true--an mp3 anthology of Nazareth's catalog on one CD. And indeed it is:\n1. Although it doesn't claim to be the complete compendium, the anthology is missing two albums--\"Close Enough for Rock N' Roll\" and \"The Fool Circle.\"\n2. The disc, despite the printed legal disclaimers and warnings, is a budged Russian bootleg, and not of a high echelon--the flies do not feature any accompanied artwork--it's bare bones, sound files only.\n3. The sound quality is generally fine, except the defect on some files on \"Play 'N' The Game.\"\n4. In some cases, the albums feature bonus tracks, but in some (ex: \"Expect No Mercy\"), they do not.\nEven with such shortcoming, it may be worth buying just for the wealth of amazing material that it does have, but don't try ordering it from Round3--you will get a CD of Soviet military choirs, guaranteed. They sent me same wrong disc twice, each time re-listing the Nazareth disc with a price hike, so it went from $11 to now $20. You can find this disc for $11 elsewhere, but if you're shopping for a compact medium of Nazareth catalog, you may want to look into other similar anthologies, for example, the two disc versions.","6728":"this is for at home to learn to meditate, not for a car listening cd. will have to try in the house and use the practices. but nothing so far that you cant learn to do on your own if you know the basics of yoga and meditation.","6729":"Let me say that I Adore Rod Stryker's \"3 Meditations to Live By\" CD (pureyoga version).  They are the backbone of my daily meditation and I use them frequently.  So when I found out that Rod had released this CD of meditations I purchased them straight away, along with Meditations for Inner and Outer Peace.\n\nI have now done all of the meditations on Four Desires.  The Bliss meditation is my favorite in this set. I noticed straight away that 2 of the meditations in this set are ones that Rod has recorded before.  The Healing the Heart meditation on this CD is the same as the \"Empowering the Heart\" meditation that I have on my precious 3 Meditations to Live By CD.  And of course, the Relax into Greatness meditation has been recorded on the CD released previously with the same name.\n\nI found that listening to the meditations with headphones sounded lots better to me than listening to it through my stereo.  Something about running the sound through the speakers seemed to make the little imperfections in sound more noticable.\n\nIt's really a great set of meditations.  The only reason I'm giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 is the delivery by Rod.  He just seemed more....caring and into it on 3 Meditations to Live By (as an example).  His delivery on these CDs seems quite a bit more \"business-like\" and matter of fact.  Also, there's no chime at the end of each meditation, so sometimes I'm not sure if the meditation is done or not unless I look at my iPod (transferred the CD).\n\nBut a great set overall....recommended.","6730":"Very good product. Happy with my purchase.","6731":"I've heard just another interpretation, by Kronos. After that I Molinari's interpretation sounds like they don't 'hear' the music, just play notes.","6732":"I really hate giving a reduced rating, but I have to honestly say, this CD is a disappointment on several fronts.\n\nThe first problem is the anachronistic temperament (system of tuning).  It is a Renaissance-era tuning, from at least 100 years before Pachelbel, suited for music of one or two keys, and possibly a very few closely related keys, but certainly not for every key, or the wide variety of keys that Pachelbel (or anyone from his era) composed for.\n\nI was thinking this must be an organ built in the 1500s and tuned with a temperament of that era, which would sound authentic with music by, for example, Scheidt and Sweelinck.  One could certainly play next to nothing by J.S. Bach on such an organ, and little by Pachelbel for that matter.  Now is it possible Pachelbel may have encountered such an organ tuned that way in his lifetime?  Maybe, maybe, I'm not saying it wasn't possible.  But I consider it highly doubtful he would have just sat down on played anything, in any key, on it.  He would have said, 'Oh dear, one of these anciently tuned monstrosities, let us see if we can find a good program only in these complementary keys.'\n\nImagine my surprise to read the liner notes and find (A) no mention whatsoever of the (admittedly intricate) topic of temperament.  So the user is just left to wonder why the thing sounds so freakin' out-of-tune.  And more surprisingly ... (B) the organ is not from the 1500s at all, it was constructed in 1702.  OK, the shoe has dropped;  the temperament is simply wrong.  That was only 4 years before Pachelbel died;  it was during J.S. Bach's teenage years when he was supposedly doing crazy things like the Toccata and Fugue in D minor and none of them were restricted to those vanilla keys.  I believe all church organs of era, certainly NEW church organs of the era which would attract great living composers and performers, were MUCH more oriented in mild temperaments that were friendly or at least usable in \"MOST\" keys.  I cannot accept this organ of the High Baroque being tuned in this manner.  MY OPINION!\n\nIf you want authenticity in old music, the instrument (and temperament) must match the composer's ideal, not simply be \"OLD\".  Otherwise, it's like taking a horse and buggy to the drive-thru window at the 1950's burger joint.  Yes, historic, but totally the wrong time period.\n\nAnd in case anyone is wondering ... temperament is decided by the tuner, not the organ builder or rebuilder.  So, yes, FYI ... this tuning was set by the most recent tuner.  It could be made into modern equal temperament, or one of the 'well-tempered' Baroque temperaments, by the NEXT tuner (with permission of the owner of course, which I hope they would give).  FYI.\n\nThe other problem with this CD is that it is played \"introspectively\" and very little joy or full-organ sound we are used to hearing from decades of other organ recordings.  Why that is, I can only speculate.  It was the organist's decision.\n\nHere are a few thoughts on each track.\n\n(1) Toccata in E minor - does not sound good in this temperament.  Also, played delicately and with many registration changes.  This is a first year piece, quite easy and I would prefer to hear it played robustly, beginning to end.\n\n(2) Allein zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ - in two sections.  The first is not ideal in this temperament, but tolerable.  The second is very sweet indeed.  The music is very simple, I have played it at Lutheran funerals.\n\n(3) Wir glauben all' an einen Gott - This has a highly decorated chorale melody, making it undiscernable (to me at least).  Of course, that is Pachelbel's doing, not the organist's.  I appreciate he is playing it strongly and at a clippy tempo.  This one does not suffer much from the temperament.\n\n(4) Wie schoen leuchtet der Morgenstern - This will be one of the few hymn tunes possibly recognizable by a modern (Lutheran) churchgoer:  O Morning Star, How Fair and Bright.  It is delicately played and easily recognizable.  The temperament is not a detriment.\n\n(5) An Wasserflussen Babylon - OK.\n\n(6) Fantasia in G minor - Temperament sounds OK in this key.  I would have preferred a little more aggressiveness, it is played introspectively.\n\n(7) Ein feste Burg - A Mighty Fortress.  Without a doubt the most recognizable hymn arrangement on this CD, and indeed what I bought the CD for.  This is the piece I played on 500th Reformation day in church last Sunday.  I am sorry to say, the temperament does not do this piece credit--it simply sounds like a neglected, out-of-tune organ.  Or at best, one which Pachelbel would have said, 'Sorry, it looks like we can't use this particular organ for this particular piece' ... in my opinion.  Also I am disappointed it is not played very joyfully.\n\n(8) Chaconne in D minor.  Temperament OK but again not played with much fire.\n\n(9) Allein Gott in der Hoh sei Ehr - How about a nice little single 8 and 2 for a change?\n\n(10) Fugue in D minor.  The chromatic step-wise fugue subject shows precisely why we need a more equal-tempered or at least well-tempered tuning to perform Pachelbel.\n\n(11) Toccata in F.  Once again, far too restrained, although the temperament sounds good here.\n\n(12) Nun lob, mein Seel', den Herren - OK.\n\n(13) Toccata in C minor.  I have just figured it out.  He must have been playing at 1:00 AM and didn't want to disturb the neighbors.\n\n(14) Werde munter, mein Gemute.  Another one of the rare hymn tunes which may be likely recognized by lay people today.  OK, I do not expect fireworks on this piece.\n\n(15) Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her.  Another better-known Christmas hymn, \"From Heaven Above\", which may be familiar to many traditional parishioners ... although not saying it is normally played from Kmart speakers during Christmas season :) Now, get this:  AARGH!  The one piece I would like to hear gently and introspectively, THIS is where he decides to pull all the stops and play full organ.  (It is a conspiracy against me! :)\n\n(16) Meine Seele erhebt der Herren - not familiar with this piece, sounds OK.\n\n(17) Magnificat Fugue Sexti Toni - At last, another fugue played joyfully, high time!\n\n(18) Prelude in D minor - Especially as a closing piece of a recital, he had the opportunity to turn this into a blazing ball of fire, and instead was very careful and conservative.\n\nNote, I mentioned the Lutheran religion several times and only because my first organ job was at a Lutheran church and I have an affinity for those chorales.  Very few of them are done at the other various Protestant churches ....\n\nThere is not a great deal of Pachelbel organ music recorded but there are several others available which I own and can highly recommend:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Gerd-Wachowski\/dp\/B0000021H9\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gerd Wachowski<\/a>&nbsp;- most highly recommended, stunning recording\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Werner-Jacob\/dp\/B00000DP64\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Werner Jacob<\/a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Joseph-Payne\/dp\/B01K8LP0MI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Joseph Payne<\/a>&nbsp;- on a fine little organ I have spent some time with :)\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Mary-Jane-Newman\/dp\/B00000J8E8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mary Jane Newman<\/a>&nbsp;- complete Fugues on the Magnificat","6733":"I own this CD and \"Johnny Has Gone for a Soldier\" is hauntingly beautiful.  I love Suzy Boggus' delivery of the song, which makes me feel the pain of the woman-in-love left behind because her love has gone to war.  I love each song on this CD - and love that it preserves so many American folk songs and puts them in their best light.  My favorites include \"Froggy Went a'Courtin'\" and \"Rock Island Line.\"  \"Froggy\" uses a Jew Harp which makes the song so much fun!  and \"Rock Island Line\" has a great rhythm.  Suzy almost \"updates\" the music while managing to be true to the original song.  (I don't know how she does that!)\n\nI don't remember if I purchased the CD via Amazon, but I have paid to download a few of Suzy's songs from Amazon for access to personal devices.","6734":"I love this version of the song and find myself singing along with it whenever it picks up on random play.  Suzy has a great voice and Erie Canal is a great old folk song.","6735":"Great for using as a ring tone since Verizon Droid Ultras are surprisingly short on options.  After much tooling around with the phone and some help from a more tech-savvy friend, I now answer calls to this lovely tune.  Make picking up the phone much more enjoyable.  :)","6736":"Billy C Craddock was popular years ago, and still has one of the best voices ever.  Plus he was smart enough to get out of mainstream that ruined so many.  This is a treasure of pure good country music... fabulous sold gold voice.","6737":"I have this soundteack (I thought) downloaded from Amazon and wanted to buy the CD for my husband to play in his k-class. The CD has completely different songs, so we were rather disappointed.","6738":"This was accidentally overcharged for the same product and yet when inquired there was nothing done and it was due to disconnection.","6739":"I've recently become interested in the music played during the  \"end credits\". I found this one particularly interesting. It starts rather quietly but builds into some full bodied gusto. It's almost like finding new music because so few in the audience stay to view and\/or listen to the end credits.","6740":"I recall the Breakout theme being longer. I hope there's longer versions out there.","6741":"Seriously?  I can get a better version from Youtube.  Don't waste your money on this, it sound nothing like the one from the trailer or from Pusher Music's (the company that owns this) site.","6742":"FYI to all buyers, you are not buying the official versions of these tracks, but covers of those tracks by the London Music Works. The music itself is OK, but it isn't the actual music from the Transformers films and trailers, and it would have been nice if they said so.","6743":"tbh I don't know how you can write a review on a song\/track, only that this particular song sounds great, perfect volume,  etc.","6744":"very relaxing, good to meditate to, fun to have playing in the winter, makes one think of summer. all of these in this series are good.","6745":"The album was in better condition than I expected.  Original from 1973 and it looks and plays like brand new.","6746":"Why did Jo Jo Gunne tail off in popularity following their first big release with the hit Run,Run,Run? Hard rock bands really liked the sound of that hit and those type of guys were the folks that really supported it. Some of the other songs on that album rocked, but from there the band adopted more of a pop,southern california teenybopper sound rather than the tougher hard-driving sound from RunRunRun. There were exceptions but Jo Jo lost it's focus on the more serious sounds. I mean bikers dug \"Run\" but they couldn't hang with much of the rest Jo Jo Gunne put out. Sure it rocked, but it was candy rock as opposed to the real gritty stuff.","6747":"Sound quality is not great.","6748":"Forgot that Amazon would have old music as well as current.","6749":"This version, as in every version I've heard recorded with the exception of the original, doesn't work at all. Novel try guys, but it doesn't even come close to how it SHOULD sound. Hopefully, some day some one will get it right.","6750":"I have almost all Sophie Zelmani's albums, and this is the one I least liked on first listen. It sounded bland and, dare I say it, boring. Then I loaded it on my MP3 player and started playing it when I went walking at dusk every day. Within the next two listens this album had me mesmerized and is now my favorite Zelmani album.\n\nThe album consists almost exclusively of ballads...backed up by some of the most beautiful acoustic guitar work you can hope to hear. The songs are mostly about love lost. Ready is the leader of the pack here and has to be one of her best songs ever. It gets ample support from the rest of the material.\n\nThe only song that feels slightly out of place is Interior Design, and it would perhaps have been better at the end of the album. The alternative version of To Know You (found on a previous album) is also negligible and not better than the original version.\n\nI'm The Rain is a wonderful album, and lovers of acoustic guitar driven ballads in particular will find plenty to appreciate.","6751":"The company, or individual, or whoever made these discs of the SWING ERA by simply recording them from the 33 LP RECORDS onto CD's obviously had no skill and doing so, took no time to help enhace the music, and obviously didn't even listen to see if the needle skipped during play. PATHETIC. I have the original 78 of this song by the REAL GLENN MILLER Orchestra, and MY 78 SOUNDS BETTER than this STEREO LP tansfer version does. In fact, I have the same ORIGINAL LP myself, and MY VERSION THAT I RECORDED OFF THE LP ONTO A CD, and then REMOVED THE SNAP CRAKLE AND POPS from it, then ENHANCED the audio, IS F A R SUPERIOR to this version. I'm sorry I bought it and should have reported it to Amazon and got my money back. I didn't, but I won't make the same mistake again.","6752":"How  do  i download it. I cant get to a download lnk i thought i was there once but nothing would play","6753":"Some of her best songs, liked the cd very much, and very pleasant voice.","6754":"If you're looking for a good sci-fi horror ambience, you just found it.  I love the entire album but my favourites are tracks 4 and 7.  I have bought both this and Fragment.  I use them in the backdrop when I run games like Arkham Horror but also finding myself sneaking them on my weekly listening playlist as well :)","6755":"I was totally satisfied with the product and your care and promptness. Thank you.","6756":"I couldn't really get into the sound.","6757":"memories. brought back so many high school memories. my brother introduce me this band also.","6758":"Not what I expected, I bought this for a friend, and it's not even Vicente Fernandez","6759":"I was interested in listening to this historical recording of a Handel opera that does not get recorded much. I was very disappointed. The sound quality was terrible. I guess we are not used anymore to how bad things sounded back then. I was more disappointed at what I missed - it all indicated that the singers had great voices. Some sound engineering would go a long way to provide a quality recording. At least the price I paid was very low","6760":"Their newer, melodic stuff is much better.  I think The Vanisher is better served to stick to good vocals to go along with the crunching guitars than screaming.","6761":"Great mix of artists. I can listen to this album all day while working. Favorite tracks: Strange Behaviour, Strobot, Yellow Shoes, and Mindscape.","6762":"THIS IS A TYPO....THE VOCAL IS NOT DORIS DAY  AMAZON ERROR\nThe Very Thought Of You [Clean]The Very Thought Of You [Clean]\nDoris Day\n From the Album  The Wartime Years - Wartime Memories [Clean]","6763":"King Diamond beautifully illustrates his nightmarish musical abilities, yet again.","6764":"This is misrepresented by appearing to have been recorded by the REAL Celtic Woman group. It is not them at all. The voices on this are almost monotone and there is little musical background to enjoy. Don't waste your money like I did.","6765":".....and, it's SOOO bad, that I'm starting to wonder if Rudy and Scott (bassist and drummer) haven't lost their ever-lovin' minds. To go from the likes of Ozzy, Quiet Riot (in their prime, no less), and Judas Priest.....and end up playing this stuff?!? I was hoping this was some kind of bad Halloween joke-band, but, NOOOOOO, it's a real project. Just awful stuff.","6766":"Great old song","6767":"didn't care for this music.","6768":"didnt use it","6769":"Didn't load correctly","6770":"garbage","6771":"garbage","6772":"didnt use it","6773":"garbage","6774":"This free compilation has a lot of good tracks. It has a little bit of everything, like for example progressive house, Progressive trance and various other electronic styles.","6775":"garbage","6776":"Ugh!","6777":"I started out just downloading a couple of songs, as I kept listening and liking, decided... what the heck, it's all good dance\/trance music. Just load the whole CD. So I did. :)","6778":"One of the most underappreciated and unknown guitarists in any genre of Music. His father was Sammy Cahn who wrote many a Sinatra classic. Steve changed the letter of his last name from a C to a K so as not to \"ride on his fathers coat tails\" A legend in the Jazz\/Fusion\/Funk scene.","6779":"garbage","6780":"garbage","6781":"Cool","6782":"garbage","6783":"Great","6784":"I first saw these guys on the Hour of Power giving their story of how they came up and was impressed. Even more impressed with their sound and lyrics when they sang. I bought their CD right away and look forward to hearing the next. God Bless GB5","6785":"Good musicians making an effort singing in the Rock & Roll language, but song writing skills become limited when feelings are delivered in a foreign tongue.\nLyrics made the Beatles unique. They were not the best musicians but what they produced was timeless.","6786":"This CD is the silliest music and lyrics I have ever bought.  Absolutely nothing to do with peaceful, tranquil music for sauna as stated on the cover of the CD.  I would not even put it on for a party.  I suggest to people who performed on that CD to quickly change career.","6787":"This legenday archive is a fabulous compilation of part of the supremacy of great pianists playing Chopin.\n\nYou'll find Rubinstein in his best years (decade of the thirties), Alfred Cortot, Geza Anda playing and admirable Etude, Scherkassky,Malcuzynski playing a memorable Polonaise and the legendary Horowitz, gathered for first time in this admirable in Chopin's memory.\n\nI bought in LP forty years ago and I still regard it one of my golden treasures. It would be a marvelous idea to exhumate this gem in CD format.\n\nPlease, if some people is reading this review and is close to the Top Management of EMI, please, give them the new. They have a diamond and it seems they have forgotten it.\n\nAdmirable and historical album all the way through. Meanwhile I really hope some blog proceeds to download it.","6788":"Great job! Very professional.","6789":"I am so lucky that I bought this cd b4 sum1 else cud. Its not that great of a cd but has sum ok songs like bahut khubsurat,aate jaate. The worse part is it has aishwarya rai jus hate her period. Dont like this actress... So this is the bad part of the Cd. If it had differnt actress cud have been nice but it dont. Just to have this last Cd is worth a buy.","6790":"The music and voices are great, as you know if you have the Firestone Stores LP from the 1960s. However, while the LP was available in vibrant stereophonic sound, this CD is monophonic and sounds a bit \"pinched\" as though too much digital noise reduction was applied. If you have no other access to this music, here it is, but be aware that it could - and should - sound better.","6791":"pretty instrumental version of Joyful, Joyful, We adore thee.  I'm glad it doesn't have lyrics.  It will be used for bridesmaids to walk down the aisle to.","6792":"I was looking for Wilson Phillips Hold On and got distracted and downloaded this song. How do I get a refund for an MP3 its not like I will ever listen to the song if that helps!","6793":"Music will not play on my phone","6794":"Saw him on Britian's Got Talent and was delighted. I think this is the best song on the album. He definitely sings with emotion. The song is beautiful and I think this is the best rendition that I have heard.","6795":"CAUTION... download does not begin at the start of the song!  Useless for me once downloaded!","6796":"This album was not at all what I had hoped for.  I purchased this for my elderly mother as a Mothers day gift and she said most of the songs were not even Floyd Cramer playing.  The only one that sounded like Floyd Cramer was his Last Date song.  I was very disappointed...especially since I bought it as a gift.  The description of the album did not mention the songs were remastered or I wouldn't have purchased this.","6797":"Beautiful music to usher in the spirit.  John's playing is inspiring and comforting all at once.  Thankful for this blessing!","6798":"Great perfprmance","6799":"The soloist on this recording was my high school choral director.  Beautiful recording!","6800":"This is a 20 second MP3.  NOT 10 minutes and it does NOT loop seamlessly.  I was using this in a Pathfinder game and even the players found it so highly distracting I went to a backup MP3 instead.  Very disappointing.","6801":"I love Maze. My father have always love these guys. **RIP** Daddy","6802":"This CD is AWESOME!!! My daughter loves to sing the Drumming with the Animals song in the car and it has a great beat to it!","6803":"Ledisi REALLY did her thing on this remake!!! I love her voice. I can't wait to see her in concert again.","6804":"Love every song on this cd.  Val Emmich is truly a talented musician who makes songwriting seem effortless as every song is meaningful and yet catchy, making you want to listen to it again and again.","6805":"GREAT SONG! AWESOME GROUP!I was happy to purchase this as soon as I wanted it. The ease of use was nice.","6806":"Not only is the music moving, beautifully arranged and performed by a group of stellar musicians, the proceeds of this album go to God's children around the world. Through Crabb Sr. with Servants of the King, money from this album goes to building orphanages, schools, leprosoriums, hospitals, and churches in India and Africa.\nI have always felt strange about buying something in order to give money to God's people, but in this case I truly would have bought it anyway. Win\/win? Sure. Then I factor in the increasing burden I have felt to give back, to change the world, to see the Kingdom grow... I asked God yesterday morning to give me a way to show the world, specifically children, His love. Then I heard about this album. Wow. So, really it's just another day I ask myself, \"If we aren't the Body, who is?\"","6807":"Frankly is best","6808":"I didn't find it relaxing because even the rain at night or wind in the trees seems to have birds making noise.  Just my opinion.","6809":"This track is listing as an \"owl hooting in the forest\", but it's not. It is actually a Mourning Dove. At least the one I got was. Maybe it was a mistake, but its certainly not an owl....","6810":"This CD offers an easy approach to learning how to meditate.  The guidance with regard to the physical focus point for breathing was very helpful to me.  I no longer think that achieving a meditative state requires a different kind of mind or absolute quiet and isolation.  It really can be done anytime and any place.","6811":"due to new amz files, can't download and amazon not being very responsive. have bought a few files that I can't find and use. it always worked very simply before","6812":"This rendition of Scarlatti is pristine from a technical and interpretation stand point. The clear like-water ornaments and trills makes this a very enjoyable listening \"ride\" that ends up being a superior experience when compared to other recordings of this same piece by much more famous guitarists. Incredible job by a very promising young talent.","6813":"Charming and hard to find song from an early Day movie, I think 'It's a Great Feeling.'","6814":"Rocking boogie woogie piano tune from old time master player. What is not to love?","6815":"No comment .","6816":"I have been listening Yoga Nidra from various masters. Of all the CDs I purchased, I consider Gurumaa's CD as the best of the best.\n\nGurumaa's voice is very soothing and comforting the listener.\n\nGurumaa is embodiment of love and her voice reflects her love for the human race.\n\nI would consider this Yoga Nidra CD suitable for all (beginner, intermediate and advanced level). During the meditation, Gurumaa guides us for mantra chanting, visualization, deep breathing, etc.","6817":"I've had difficulty in finding this CD and special thanks to Amazon for making this possible. Philip Bailey is outstanding and has a dynamic voice to match his God-ordained talents","6818":"didn't like it at all","6819":"When I ordered it I thought I was going to get at least 3 CD's covering his work like the best of Andrea Crouch which I bought a few years ago. But I only received 1 . That to me is daylight robbery. There is no justification for 1 CD to cost $60.00 . Left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Plus the sender was very rude and silly in their response to me.","6820":"Great blues song I love it.","6821":"I wanted flute music, not chirping birds, and crickets!","6822":"Love it!!  He had such a smooth sound...his music sounds as good now as 50 years ago. Using this song in the ad is great!","6823":"and threw together a \"sound sculpture\" or \"noise poem\" or \"sonic landscape\".\nWhat it isn't is \"MUSIC.\" It's basically a random splattering of rhythmless tones and samples. But for just under an hour of annoying your neighbors:\nwhat the 4*ck, it's only a buck.\n~!","6824":"One of their best songs.  They even say so at the end.","6825":"Great Song to relax and study to. Recommended to anyone who's a fan of Amethystium, Enigma, Sunlounger, and Cafe del Mar.","6826":"Such a beautiful song! I do wish it was a little longer, but once you buy it, you can listen to it over and over!!","6827":"I know the artist's mother.  Jenna's voice is resinating.  You have to try this recording of Clear.  U will not be disappointed with this purchase.","6828":"Ethella Chuprik is a top-tier Beethoven sonatas interpreter.\nExcellent record quality.\nIt is a shame that Ethella Chupryk's name is not among the most popular pianists of this century.","6829":"This song will make a Texan shout, howl, and say AMEN!  If you look in the dictionary under 'Rockin' Texas Blues Ax Man' you'll find Smokin' Jo Kubek's picture. This is just one excellent example of Electric Texas Blues. The kind of stuff that'll get you movin' down the road.  What else can I say, I'm a prejudice Texan and MY HEART IS IN TEXAS and in Rockin' Texas Blues!","6830":"Awesome way to keep the nyhc scene alive for us oldskool cats!! Been around the scene 20 years and still down","6831":"Great.","6832":"the music sucks only got it because it was free","6833":"Fun songs for the whole family!","6834":"This is a group that truly represents the standard of excellence that God is calling for His children to have.  If you haven't seen or heard of \"Chosen\", get to Greenville, SC and check them out!  You will be blessed!  Holy & Righteous is a powerful and anointed song!  Call your radio stations and request this awesome song today! I love you family!","6835":"I love it!","6836":"Such a beautiful song!","6837":"I don't remember this song, so it probably sucks.","6838":"I love kirby krackle. They do spectacular music. Although I enjoyed the previous cd more, this cd is still amazing, and anyone who found this cd should buy this cd and support Kirby Krackle's incredible music.","6839":"I really wish I could give this a positive review, because I was down with the concept - nerdy pop songs for comic fanboys (& girlz). Unfortunately, the acoustic pop-ballad approach just isn't working for me. I'm sure this will go over big with the audience that bought the (pop music) \"soundtrack album\" CDs for the Batman & Spider-Man movies, but musically, it's just too simple for me. I was hoping for an upbeat power-pop thing with playful riffs and hooks, maybe along the lines of Weezer or The Apples In Stereo, but this isn't it. There's a sameness to it, from one song to the next. The songs themselves are well-written and I can appreciate all the comic book references, but I just can't imagine listening to this more than once or twice. Too bad, but good thing Amazon had samples to listen to. I almost purchased this unheard, based solely on positive reviews and the nerd-band concept. Oh well, can't win 'em all.\n\nYour mileage may vary, as they say in the commercials. Feel free to lambaste me with your \"don't listen to this guy\" comments.","6840":"Very pleased with this music.","6841":"there isn't anything i like \"most\" about it---really not for someone wants to relax and\/or sleep---the pieces are way to fast (lots of notes in short time frames)..just so conscious of someone playing piano music that is not that good as music--but the point of ' for sleep aid'  music is to not be \"good\" in terms of quality, substance--we need repetition and soft flow without being annoyingly repetitive--this cd doesn't offer any of the requirements for relaxing\/sleeping - for me.","6842":"So lovely and relaxing to listen to","6843":"I don't remember this song, so it probably sucks.","6844":"Bought this one by accident. I couldn't get into it. Was not feeling it.","6845":"Loved this song the first time I heard it.  When I got home from church I came to Amazon and downloaded it.  Its now part of my favorites.  So I listen to it at least onces7 a day.","6846":"Clasical guitar, not my type of music,.  Maybe its classafied as \"new age\",?  Not familiar with any of the selections.","6847":"Just wanna say I've been following Paul since the '90s. He's returned to his roots in a big way as he represents ace selections of\nTrance, Psy, Progressive, and Breaks. NMTB stays true to the sound while excelling at being fresh and new.\nThis mix was released just before We Are Planet Perfecto Vol 1.\nBoth are awesome current EDM but I'll take this one as the more solid choice.\n\nAnyone like a bit of MUSIC in their EDM? Paul constantly knocks it out and knows how to flow melody and harmony. Not too jarring but the right amount of edge and groove, fast seamless mixing, upbeat friendly BPMs. I give it extra points for not beating you over the head with diva vocals. Just not my thing and that's what radio tunes rely on.\n\nYou know you want it. Just get it.","6848":"helped me lots","6849":"Aach! Totally sucks.  Peggy-O was one of my favorite Dead tunes, but this does it no justice.  Like the title said, there was a reason the Dead dumped the Godchaux's, they suck (regardless of the embezzlement rumors).","6850":"It's ok","6851":"not good","6852":"A freebie from our friends at Amazon.  I always enjoy a good freebie, it is a great way to try things.","6853":"I have to say that i am an Old Skid Row fan and will always be. The new song remind me of them great Skid days of the 80's!\nIt's FN a killer tune!","6854":"IMpressive playing and yes, I agree with the previous reviewer, you would need to be rather brave to play these pieces. The technique demonstrated is spot on in regards to execution and yes, sound. The sound is full, not overdone, which can be the case in recordings of modern music where the emphasis is too often placed on, hey listen to this weird sound..nope, this recording shows the music","6855":"Dope as hell.","6856":"Great song from a great band.","6857":"WOW. This is powerful worship. Lyndell is a great worship leader. He has put together a great project to help you foster your relationship with God. O e track brought me to tears at the revelation of how much Jesus loves us.","6858":"I got this CD from Milagres. AMAZING new stuff!! I am addicted. Love Glowing Mouth, Halfway, Gone, Here to Stay.. THE WHOLE CD IS LEGIT. Check em out, buy their music, and share. So glad I discovered these guys :) Can't wait to see them live.\n\nPS, Some songs kind of sound like Muse (maybe just the vocals)... what you think?","6859":"great piece of work","6860":"Terrible! If you want to hear someone in broken English sing Amy Winehouse (in the worst tribute ever to her great music), you will like this. Complete waste of money (even a small incremental amount is too much for this)!","6861":"There are plenty of songs, but not upbeat and fun to keep the class pushing themselves. Ok for bacground sound.","6862":"Not good quality by today's standards","6863":"Clear sound","6864":"Nice collections of songs.  I really love their music and the way their voices blend so well together.","6865":"HI Jae,\n\njust found the song on your facebook, and bought it here. LOVE IT! Can't wait to hear more from you!","6866":"I happened upon this album sort of by accident...I heard an interview with Anna Clyne on NPR and loved what I heard, so came to Amazon to do a search...and discovered this gem. Each song tells a story, with the strings sounding like they're breathing. The compositions are intricate and complex in an incredibly beautiful way. There is a sense of melancholy that is very engaging. I look forward to more of her work.","6867":"Trace Adkins has always been a first-rate song stylist, able to project huge emotional power and stylistic range.  All of his classiness and talent gets erased, though, by \"More Of Us,\" a bonus track on the \"deluxe edition\" where he embraces the most corrosive aspects of \"tea party\" politics, first playing the victim card by whining about the imaginary oppression of \"us\" true-blue, red-blooded, God-loving, flag-waving Americans and calling for \"real Americans\" to \"push back\" against the nasty people who supposedly hate God and need to be reminded that \"there's more of us than there are of them.\"\n\nNow, I'm pretty sure that I have a few political differences with Mr. Adkins and whoever wrote this song, but I gotta say, it really ticks me off to have them talk about me -- and other people -- as though I don't deserve to live in America and that having a different point of view makes me some kind of a traitor. I was born in America, I love this country, I pay my taxes, I go to church and I vote in every election, and I have as much right to my beliefs as anyone else. Talking about \"double-checking\" who the real Americans are is probably the single most un-American, unpatriotic act that anyone could make, including big Nashville stars. We're all Americans, and we should respect one another -- that's part of loving America.\n\nThis kind of tough talk and destructive, violent, let's-have-a-civil-war, chest-thumping might sell a few records, but it isn't going to help solve any problems. Frankly I'm disappointed and embarrassed to hear one of my favorite modern artists sink so low. You should be ashamed, Mr. Adkins. This is truly unworthy of your talent. (Axton)","6868":"Amazing DJ tool.  Gives a deep dark cinematic \"all the feels\" dimension to your set.","6869":"I have to admit, Klaatu is a total guilty pleasure. These are they guys that pretty much created \"Space Rock\" with songs about interplanetary craft, tranversing the universe in 80 days, a scientifically accurate song about neutrinos, and a bona fide space rock opera on side two of the album HOPE. Throw in some nice, though odd, love ballads with decidedly Beatle influences, and you have a unique and rather obscure listening experience.\n\nReally, \"Rarities?\" I was a little skeptical, but after listening to this, I am quite pleased. You can't get more obscure than some of these remixes. I mean, who really cares? Well, I do!\n\nI especially like the reworking of \"Silly Boys,\" and the shortened version of \"Calling Occupants\" works well for me. The live set at the end is rather nice, and they have a wonderful live version of \"Little Neutrino.\" Good stuff.\n\nAn added bonus is an alternate version of \"Hope\" with a little dialogue by the Lighthouse Keeper that appeared lyrically on the LP HOPE on the lyric sheet, but was not on the album. What a nice \"hidden track\" surprise. I was not so impressed with the MAGENTALANE out takes, but I never really warmed to that album.\n\nIf you are a Klaatu fan, this is really fun. If you are not, I would suggest starting with the first album or the retrospective PEAKS. The purely instrumental takes are of interest of those of us who know the songs, but the sans vocal tracks might not make a lot of sense to the uninitiated.","6870":"We used this for a beach wedding on Topsail Island. The bridesmaids and groomsmen walked down the beach to this music. It was perfect music for a beach wedding.","6871":"My son is a US MARINE and he is the one that told me I should get this song and everytime I listen to it I think of him..Thanks Trace","6872":"This compilation features some excellent Jamaican roots music, and is well worth a listen. In particular the smoldering performance by Hortense Ellis, Alton Ellis's sister, on \"Hell and Sorrow,\" and Errol Dunkley's re-imagining of the song as \"Black Cinderella,\" are worth the price of admission not to mention Big Youth's run on another version.\n\nOn top of that, you've got another great Dunkley tune and some classic tracks from Leroy Smart, including of course \"Mother Liza.\"\n\nThe only drawback, I'd say, is that the versions come so hot and heavy. From \"Hell and Sorrow\" to August Pablo's \"Cinderella in Black,\" all the way to \"Zion Youth\" by Vin Goron, you get 6 versions in a row on the same riddim comprehensive, sure, and unquestionably filler-free. Still, neophytes into the world of Jamaican music may get some ear fatigue.\n\nNonetheless, 5 stars all the way.","6873":"I only bought this song to dj a party. They only danced to it for like 10 seconds then stopped. Plus the quality of the track was poor.","6874":"Another great tune done by the Daredevils.  Don't look down, look back.  There are several other standouts on this album.","6875":"This is just an oldie, but a goodie I wanted to add to the collection before i can't remember them anymore...","6876":"Smart, thoughtful, harmonically and rhythmically unpredictable songs, with classical touches. Delicate, tasteful. Sweet voice. A bit of a downer tone-wise, and subject matter-wise. Music haunting and aching rather than catchy. Features mandolin god Chris Thile on a cut.","6877":"Superb performances terribly reproduced by the worst of the early 1980's digital CD's I have ever heard.","6878":"Very disappointing sound quality. Monaural, center-channel only. I have the CD's for other The Hot Sardine music and they are a good group. Too bad this collection is so poorly presented to the public.","6879":"Wonderful music.  Great to listen to.","6880":"This song confuses me, or at least the opening does; which sets itself up to deliver an intriguingly atmospheric industrial influenced track only to drop that wavelength altogether and jump into a variation of 70's southern rock.  The song itself has merit, for in parts it is soft and nicely rendered, but there are too many aspects of this track that miss the mark.  The overly repetitive musical arrangement is simple to a fault, especially when the track lasts for nearly eight minutes.  It wears out its welcome by presenting us with no real variations in tone to keep us interested.  The vocals, while interestingly muffled, become almost lazy sounding after a while.  I love the lyrical content, which is inspired and interesting, but as a whole this song fails because it lacks balance.\n\nI can't say I'm truly intrigued here.","6881":"This album is amazing! The pipes and fiddle are so locked in with each other, it takes me to a place of pure happiness. This is great adrenaline music, too. In my car whenever I hear the pipes drone start, and then Mick's chanter busts in, I turn up the volume and drive a little faster. And, great tunes, too.","6882":"I freaken love this CD.  If you like fiddles and pipes, you will love this stuff.  If you don't, then you should probably go back to your Miley Cirus collection or something.  The pipe and fiddle duets are in a strange as key, but you can figgure them out with the amazing slow downer.  The only thing I find impossible about this CD is pronouncing \"Raghallaigh\".","6883":"I really enjoyed this album, it has some wonderfully texture tracks, that I found captivating and also excellent driving muisc!! Give it a listen, you won't be dissapointed","6884":"I had never heard on Tommy Stinson before picking up this free track, but I really enjoyed it. It sounds like good ol' fashioned rock and roll. Very good deal. I recommend to others.","6885":"Leon Berry is the best at the 'Giant Wurlitzer Organ at the Hub Rink' he even went so far as to rescue a Lion Wurlitzer from Lake Theater in Crystal Lake and installed it in his basement, He renamed it as the 'Beast in the Basement'. I have that Vinyl album that my parents purchased in the late 1950's. So I purchased this CD(Leon Berry at the Hub Rink Wurlitzer- His First and Rarest Recordings!, Vol. 2 ) with out any worries because I loved 'Beast in the Basement'. I love the fidelity of this CD every song is crisp and you can hear every Glockenspiels Traps and all of the Pipes. Its a wonderful sound that cannot be found anywhere else and if should purchase this CD play it with lights off and the room will come alive and you would swear that you were inside the organ it self!","6886":"All I can say is the old man is still doing it. This one is my favorite. I got on to him about 35 years ago when he took the charts with Let's Straighten It Out.","6887":"...with no two tunes sounding alike.  John Nicole is clearly a gifted and diverse musician and songwriter, with a bevy of influences that inform his music.  This is not an album for someone who doesn't like to be surprised by what they're hearing, but any true music fan will enjoy and appreciate John's range of stylistic depth.","6888":"\"This song is the audio equivalent of sitting on the beach on a warm summer evening. It is inherently romantic and perfect for setting the mood for just those right moments.\" - Zack Daggy","6889":"It did not uplift me in any way. I downloaded it for someone else. I would not have purchased it for myself. I like most songs by this artist, but not this one. It's just ok for me.","6890":"The recording is a proletariat work at best.  While the melody is passable, the lyrics seem to lack any notable inspiration.","6891":"Excellent message. Thanks Matt.","6892":"Wayne is a local favorite in Colorado Springs.  Wayne's style easily shows hints of Carlos Santana and Jeff Beck.  His acoustic work is equally exciting.  This CD is a great showcase of talent by Wayne and all the collaborators on this disc.  Seeing Wayne and the band live is an aural treat!  The last track on this CD is a scortcher.","6893":"Dude... pronunciation is terrible. I appreciate the idea of having a non-native speaker perhaps be less intimidating, but at least find someone who can say the words correctly. This is teaching butchering of a beautiful language. I appreciate the effort bro, but this is just not right.","6894":"Not enough content for the price and the pronunciation is not very good.  The pronunciation has a heavy southern U.S.accent.  Some words even seemed to be mispronounced.  I wish I could get a refund.  I will be much more cautious with future digital orders from Amazon.","6895":"I accidentally bought this with one-click and am going to ask for a refund. The speaker has a heavy American accent and while I can usually figure out what he is trying to say, he uses American vowel pronunciations and often stresses the wrong syllables. It just isn't a good learning tool for those who hope to converse with native Spanish speakers.","6896":"not the one i was looking for","6897":"corney and a rip off...did not like the feel. we need more soul in the new dancehall like early to mid 2000's.","6898":"I have never really been a Kirk Franklin fan, but a choir my daughter sang with selected this song.  This is a beautiful song-well written and beautifully sung.","6899":"Yessss! I love Kirk Franklin and this song has a nice funky beat with an awesome and pertinent message for everyone, any day!","6900":"I like this song.  I've just discovered it.","6901":"don't buy!!!","6902":"If you are a true gospel fan, you will know when Shirley is on a song.  Pastor Ceasar showed up and showed out with this one.  This is such an inspirational song.","6903":"I found him on youtube, and the love way he and his people put the song together and his performance of each song just make you witch over and over again. One of the best young male singer out of asia.","6904":"Was ok, to get an intro-flavor, but just barely ok.","6905":"This is just OK","6906":"There are a number of songs on this album that had my head moving and my feet dancing. Go for it!","6907":"This song is alright.  it gets me through the day with my other music. I love listening to reggae music.","6908":"Good","6909":"...is a sweeter sound now Ray Thomas' beautiful solo albums are once more available. For too long, From Mighty Oaks has only been available at silly prices and Hopes Wishes & Dreams not at all. Esoteric have done a wonderful job on this set. Disc one is the remastered version of From Mighty Oaks and disc two is Hopes Wishes & Dreams, also remastered. Both discs are packaged in delightfully done replicas of the original vinyl sleeves. Disc 3 is a DVD which plays Mighty Oaks in quadrophonic sound accompanied by camera pans over the artwork for the album sleeve, plus the promo video for High Above My Head. Disc 4 contains a cleverly edited version of the question and answer promo disc from 1975 with Mike Pinder asking the questions, plus the single versions of the songs and for a real bonus, a wonderful NEW song from Ray - The Trouble with Memories. The package is rounded out with postcard reproductions of the artwork for both albums and a booklet containing archive and new photographs, artwork, lyrics and a new interview with Ray. If you're a Moody Blues fan, this is indispensible, even if you have the existing CDs. If only Ray had made more solo albums.....","6910":"This is a beautiful song - well sung, nice simple lyrics with a catchy refrain. If you're in the mood for something calm and easy, try this...you won't be disappointed.  :)","6911":"I love everything this musician creates......This is a beautiful piece........","6912":"Love this song!!!  Brings back so many memories of love... sharing love on the most important day of your lives!!! ;)","6913":"I ordered Rafael Hernandez songs and all I got is some of his instrumental music and no songs.  I wanted to hear his old songs being song by old artists, instead the CD is all instrumental (modern instruments).  This should have been clarified in the CD before purchase.","6914":"While this would be a step forward for anyone else, the band has a talent for effortlessly making the unpolished seem charming as it breezes its way through tracks","6915":"This song sounds great when one can find a decent recording. The MP3 from Amazon is a \"no-go.\"\n\nSOUND QUALITY\n1. iPad with built-in speaker: Tolerable.\n2. iPad with Apple Ear-buds: Obviously limited frequency range, clearly sticks out from other songs: marginal\n3. IPad with Sennheiser 500 over the ear headphones: limited frequency range; \"pushed\" dynamic range. Distortion ruins what little of the song which remains.\n4. Denon\/Martin-Logan\/Bi-amped Polk LSi tower speakers: \"Could someone please turn that off?\"\n\nPROBLEM\nWell, there can't be too much of a problem when the song was less than a dollar, right?  Yet, other songs in the same price range are consistently worth 4-stars in Sound Quality (the limit of sound quality for an MP3, based on the amount of lossy compression applied). What happened?\n1. Too much of an attempt to increase the dynamic range through use of a compressor on the final mix-down track?\n2. A multi-generation recording, in which multiple forms of compression and conversion had been used. Where's the Master?\n3. Product Quality Control. Granted, Amazon QA listeners can only listen to so many songs before their head feels like it's about to explode! I am sure an existing application can be tweaked to analyze each contributed song for preset frequency range requirements, dynamic range requirements, harmonic distortion levels and other audio specifications. Those songs that are rejected, can be listened to, to determine if the song is intentionally manipulating sounds for effects purposes, and passed or failed. To send this song out, at any cost, is a poor reflection of the Music Services offered by Amazon, or any other music distributor.","6916":"its new, well recorded, and well packaged. It arrived on time. The most important thing is that I like the music very much","6917":"Pitch lower","6918":"Love and listen to this music all the time! The music appeals to a wide range of demographics! It is old time gospel music sung straight from the heart with an excellent band! So uplifting. Here's how I found this band...the band opened a concert for my favorite singer, Michael W. Smith!","6919":"Love this song.","6920":"Another song as a narrative for a moment\nin Prime Time TV.\nI heard this during a very sad episode of NBC'S\nMiami Vice. The background vocals are timed\nperfectly, they are beautiful, & they sound\nlike a church choir; Gospel in fact.\nThe title of this song is universal, the search\nfor love is something that we adults look for\nall the time. Yes, we want to know what LOVE is\nwhen we are hurt by what we thought LOVE\nwas. Especially when we gave, & feel we didn't\nreceive.. A Beautiful song that raises a life\nquestion that needs definition by faith in \nLOVE.","6921":"Copies if the originals with a different singer.  Its like ordering a Coke at a restaurant and the waitress gives you a generic cola without telling you.","6922":"Fooled me. No Lou Gramm! I guess Mick Jones didn't want to pay him royalties. Only saving grace is that Jason Bonham and Jeff Pilson are somewhere on the record. And those two guys are awesome.","6923":"I bought this album.  Disappointed.\nI was expecting to get the digitally remastered original music.\nDefinitely not the original music. Not even close.","6924":"Someone should be arrested for putting this out.  Not original songs.  Total rip off.  Buyer beware!","6925":"Don't care for this","6926":"Exactly what we were looking for","6927":"I haven' been able to listen to the piece on my computer.  I love the piece, but can't give it a high rating if I can't listen to it.  Please tell me how to find it.  I searched for it and the computer couldn't find it.  since I pain money for it, this is particularly irritating to me.","6928":"beautiful, melodious, sorrowful, and enduring","6929":"One of my favorite songs!","6930":"Arrived on time but skips on almost every track.","6931":"thought it would be more","6932":"I have got almost all of Ronan's album and by far, it is one of the least favourite album on my list. It will probably just stay in my CD shelf...","6933":"I listened to the samples on this album and think Ronan was the wrong person to interpret Burt's songs. The singing isn't very good and I can't warm to his voice at all - it's like he's trying to make Burt's music sound cool for today's generation, but it backfires on him, as his voice sounds really, really shocking in places.  I saw this album at another store today, and thought, should I buy blindly? I'm so glad I didn't, as I would have been extremely disappointed.\n\nThe last singer I enjoyed (who collaborating with Burt)  was Elvis Costello on the Painted from Memory album. I really enjoyed his singing and the orchestrations for that album. Sadly, there is no warming endorsements here from me. I enjoyed Ronan when he was in Boyzone, and love music of the 1960s, but this album is one I won't be buying.","6934":"I like Ronan Keating, but this album just isn't any good.  His voice isn't right for this kind of music, and it really shows right from the first song.  The vocals don't mesh well with the music.","6935":"\"Hell on Heels\" is the debut album from Pistol Annies. This country super group features Miranda Lambert, Ashley Monroe, and Angaleena Presley. They are incredibly talented musicians, singers, and song writers, and anyone who listens will be impressed with their brand of country music. Their songs cover everything from domestic frustration (\"The Hunter's Wife\"), the female virtue (\"Beige\") and good ol' fashioned rebellion (\"Hell on Wheels\" and \"Takin' Pills\"). The music is awesome and features a classic country sound with some blues, honky-tonk and bluegrass influences. All three women share lead vocals on different parts of different songs, and the results are amazing. Their hooks are catchy, their harmonies and melodies are phenomenal, and the chemistry between them is perfect. This is definitely worth a listen!","6936":"love it","6937":"Donald Lawrence produces great music that exemplifies the Word of God.  Music ministry at its best and ministers to the soul.","6938":"Oh my goodness! The lyrics are absolutely beautiful. She really takes you into the realm of the Spirit when you listen to her. The music and background vocals add so much rich flavor to the overall composition. All of her music is just a blessing to hear. There are songs I can take back to my choir and then there are songs just for me in my car. Compelling!","6939":"Wil pulls together some deep tracks here from the Beatles' huge catalog. His unique interpretations run the gamut of Jazz styles. Some songs are faithful to the original like \"Can't Do That\" which is rendered in a jazzy rock style with the guitar part mixed forward and Wil's smooth tone and beautiful phrasing almost singing to melody to us. Or \"Hey, Bulldog\" a guitar forward piece with staccato three part horn hits. And, \"Fixing A Hole\", the title track, oozing with sweet Cool Jazz lines.\n\nDid I mention that Wil plays all the instruments here? Yep. If you're a musician, listen closely to the guitar chord voicings. His harmonic sense is impeccable. The bass playing is excellent too. Again, Wil hops between styles and creates -- not mimics -- riffs of every flavor.\n\nI've had the pleasure of seeing Wil perform live in Austin, TX when he lived and played here. You must see Wil live in New York where he lives now. He is a humble, gentle, musical genius who has one of the best alto tones I've ever heard. Wil loves and lives music, and there's a light in him of joy that's infectious.","6940":"I have to say that I really love this CD! It's on my iPod, on my computer and in my car. Wil Greenstreet is true musician, technically perfect and very adaptable to any genre and artist. I love him most when he plays songs that he writes. That's another story. This recording exemplifies Wil at large with the Beatles and boy does hit he do it well. I wish the world could hear Wil.  More like this please Wil.","6941":"Althoagh Im not familiar with all of these timeless melodies Wil has breathed life into these in much the same way as Charlie Parker\ndid  with a smaltz string orchestre backing to some well worn standards. As a former jazz bass player  I liked Wil's lines a lot!\nWell done! Be interesting to hear his take on some more of the Beatles. Eleanor Rigby? Norwegian Wood?","6942":"Disappointing-- and the initial music for each section becomes annoying.  I should have looked more carefully at the headings--- way too many \"numbers\" and not nearly enough Italian conversation\/phrases.","6943":"Just bought this song today. Only have of the song will play. Will not download at all. First time I've ever had this kind of trouble. Needed this song to today to make a CD for dance practice. Nothing happening today. I am a die hard Amazon fan. This is my go to for anything. I would rather shop with them than go to an actually store. Disappointed for the first time.","6944":"If you are a Rough Cutt fan or a fan of Paul Shortino this is a must buy. This album rocks!","6945":"As with their previous SACD releases, the German recording label Tacet manages to brilliantly capture a splendid performance by the Polish Chamber Orchestra, led by Wojciech Rajsk. The timbre of the instruments feels almost palpable. And that's exactly why this disc is so frustrating. In order to hear these incredible musicians at work, one has to endure the overly affected narration that permeates the performance. On top of that, Prokofiev's original text in Peter and the Wolf was forsaken for a new and extended one as told by an owl, while Saint-Sans's Carnival of the Animals got a totally new narration where originally there was none. These changes dilute the music, robbing the works of their natural continuity.\n\nThis is undoubtedly a subjective assessment, since the overall length of this Peter and the Wolf at 31:32 is just a few minutes longer than Andre Previn on a Telarc CD at 27.22. Nevertheless, it does feel like an eternity when one is so eager to hear more of the music, although kids might actually enjoy the experience, and they are after all, the target audience.\n\nAs for Tacet's so-called Moving Surround Sound, despite some unorthodox shifts in the placement of the instruments, it is done rather creatively and fits the playful mood of this specific repertoire, at least as far the stereo SACD layer is concerned. Unfortunately though, the narration takes center stage most of the time and left me wishing for Peter and the hunters to leave the wolf alone and go instead after the poor fellow doing the honors.","6946":"I love all of johhny lee's music.  released in 2006. lot of great tracks. Includes a brand new recording mix of yellow rose of texas.  includes 18 tracks.  17 of which are new.  the best ones are-sawin' on a fiddle-down home country girl-drivin' myself to drinkin' and just wastin time.  My favorite is the way things otta be, kind of like a haggard type track but great.  the last track as a bonus includes the hilarious-santa claus is lookin' for love.  If you like johnny lee buy this album, it is worth the price!","6947":"I don't know...Maybe i gave this two stars because i just can't stand to admit these guys have completely lost it.\nThe songs are weak, the playing uninspired, the production limp and the singing just sounds tired.\nI guess i'll stand by the two stars as it's slightly better than the last record, but damn, i used to really love these guys and hard rock rarely gets better than their 2nd record Get Used To It.","6948":"This is an exceptional album on so many levels. It didn't necessary make the same emotional connection to me as the previous two albums, but you could see the maturation and progression musically. This is definitely his most varied (and even accessible) album from a musical standpoint. It is refreshing to see that he is not allowing himself to be confined by the constraints of the label \"singer-songwriter\". Along with this being a more textured album from a musical and sonic viewpoint, it also posses many of Mangan's considerable gifts. He is an insightful, articulate & witty lyricist. His voice also continues to be a powerful emotive instrument. This album is not only worth your attention, but Mangan also deserves a bigger profile (outside of fans of CBC Radio 3). Hopefully this album helps him to continue to do so.","6949":"Beautiful composition! I love Robert Cundick's music.","6950":"Had the original album from Apple a long time ago. Paul McCartney played the bass on the song I believe.","6951":"A must have addition to any collection of American music.","6952":"I'm not sure who the organist is, but this track is ridiculous - especially the reed fanfare after the key change.  (Yes, that's supposed to be an E natural!)","6953":"Scandals my faviret band love thare music im glade I finly have some ware I can buy it. and it wus duliverd qicly.","6954":"for all that fan of LU and andoval here is a very good live album with new and old songs","6955":"This MP3 should have contained four tunes: Marino Casion, Gerry Cronin's Reel, Denis Langton's Reel, and The Irish Washerwoman.  It should have been miore than ten minutes of music.\n\nThe actual download consisted of only one tune: Marino Casino.  It was less than four minutes of music.\n\nSince it was an MP3, Amazon policy did not provide for a return.  I made one contact to Amazon Customer Service and was immediately provided with a full refund.\n\nIt was a not-so-good purchase, but it was exceptional customer service from Amazon.","6956":"As usual with Odell Brown and The Organizers always good Listening and as specially if you like horns The blends are superb I regard this album as a kick around of tasteful sound well done guys well done","6957":"Tried to download this song on my Droid... it started to download and then forced closed.... it even charged my acccount. Very disappointed!","6958":"I miss you~ DBP  :)","6959":"This is not the original song recorded many years ago in Venezuela by Cuentos de la Cripta.  Is just a bad imitation...","6960":"I heard a clip of this song on a lotto commercial. I gave it a couple of listens. Not that impressed with it, ultimately. The lyrics come off as cartoonish and mocking. Kate Miller-Heidke's vocals are a bit obnoxiously high pitched and scratchy for my liking. Not my cup of tea.","6961":"This song is featured in a beginner guitar class that I am taking.  Being musically inept, I needed something better than the lyrics to practice with.  I found sheet music for guitar but there is nothing like the real thing to listen to.  I remember the popularity of the song, but I had not examined the lyrics until now.  An interesting and puzzling sort of Neil Young tribute with a great rhythm.","6962":"Sweet rhythmic head candy","6963":"This was difficult to download. Plus, one of the tracks skips and is cut off. This was not worth the money...","6964":"U must have it. Why aren't they still alive as a band!!","6965":"Classic western music.  I needed this for a cowboy themed party.  They don't much more cowboy than this.  Can't go wrong.","6966":"If you are looking for the excellent, moving title track to the film, _For A Few Dollars More_ by Ennio Morricone, DO NOT buy this song! It is an inferior version - the whistling part is nauseatingly off-key. I couldn't even listen after the first 15 seconds. Please find the track you're looking for elsewhere.","6967":"Awesome guitarist - made me actually want to listen to MJ again!","6968":"Not for fans of Mirah. This is pure garbage.  I will never forgive you!\n\nFor fans of: Overproduction, auto-tune, J-Lo's first album.","6969":"I am going to write this review as unbiased as possible.  And I do accept responsibility for taking a chance on buying this CD as it was a.) mixed by someone I never heard of b.) it was coming from the Czeck Republic and c.) there were no other reviews to go by.\n\nWhat I was hoping to get was a compilation disk - containing a number of dnb artists like Teebee and Stakka & Skynet that fall into the nerofunk\/futurestep category of this genre - to me one of the most creative, unique and progressive areas of dnb that mix together spacey verbed out sinister atmosphere's, hard, edgy heavily filtered dark and evil synth\/bass lines, and beats that are along the techstep line but have more presence and are generally at a slightly slower tempo around 170-175 beats per minute.\n\nWhile the disk did include the artists I mentioned above, rather than expanding upon the sounds of nerofunk\/futurestep Koogi chose to completely soften (marshmellowize if I can coin a term) the experience by mixing a chill, loungy, groove oriented set targeted to the martini bar hipster crowd.\n\nThe dark and sinister tones of minor and disonant keys used in nerofunk\/futurestep were transposed to more \"easy on the ear\" sounding major keyes - the pads were joyous and elated instead of being mean and ominous.  The basslines were subdued instead of hitting your mind like a right hook, and gorgeous sounding female vocals were overlayed throughout, which I just don't get as this ain't supposed to be HOUSE.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are looking for a good neurofunk\/futurestep experience, take a pass.  If you want to try out something in dnb and like chill grooves this may be interesting to you.\n\nOn a final note, Koogi does mix well, the quality of the sound is very good and I received the CD very quickly even though it came from Eastern Europe.","6970":"Everybody loves this song !","6971":"Great classic song.","6972":"It would have been a complete 5 stars... but what is a Queen's Greatest Hit Album without Bohemian Rhapsody?","6973":"Again more great songs and lyrics from this band that sounds more like southern rock.  Put them up there with one of the great bands in christian music.","6974":"this is a great song for rock lovers.  this song has a great meaning awesome vocals and sound i highly recommend this band.","6975":"This is not the actual Glee cast singing the songs. At least not the ones who originally sang them. If you just like the music it is ok but if you like the voices of the cast members do not buy it for they are not in it.","6976":"Had heard it on Pandora and extremely disappointed to find that only 2 tracks were relaxing!  So 1 star per track!  Maybe cd version with the three cds is better.but sure threw money away on this one!  Sampled are deceiving.","6977":"Great.","6978":"Best winning twam some ever","6979":"Ike Willis delivers a fantastic collection of songs influenced by Zappa's Jazz and Pop vocal sensibilities.  Ike's guitar playing is on point and is reminiscent of Frank himself.  The compositions are tight, and every song showcases Ike's beautiful soulful voice amidst well crafted, catchy, and thought provoking music.  Bravo Ike!","6980":"I am 75 years old and a traditional country music lover\nall my life. I am one of the few female steel guitar musicians\nand I love good steel guitar music.  Her steel player is\nawesome, and I appreciate the fact that Connie remains\n100% traditional country music.

Thank you Connie for\nsuch awesome music.","6981":"She must have published this herself, surely no one else wold have. ABSOUTELY HORRIBLE!","6982":"This is my favorite version. It is so delicate yet strong. Yet again, I wish I could access it on the kindle app of my phone.","6983":"The first track is decent. The rest is a perfect soundtrack to any mid '90s Cinemax late night movie. The cover art would be more appropriate with dry-humping and a linen suit.","6984":"This is not the song it says it is","6985":"remix  ugh  hate it  i got the wrong mp3","6986":"Use it for my Dance Class.","6987":"I Absolutely love this song!! Such a Blessing to believers who know there is Nothing in this World more Powerful than Gods Love!!","6988":"I first heard this song and just HAD to hear it again and again.  Then I loved it so much; I had to buy it.  It has a very different sound, which I really enjoyed and the words in the  song itself, captured me. What came across to me in the song was that even if I know God (which I am privileged to say Yes, I know Him, some) there is more to rediscover.  There are sides to Him that I need to know; that I don't know it all, but I can go on a road of discovery and rediscovery of God.  There may be some that the song doesn't do it for them; because we all have different ways that music touches us; some may not like the style  of the artists but to me, the song is Golden and just brings me even deeper into His presence and desire to be seeking His face.","6989":"Marilena is the best!","6990":"This is one of the poorest renditions in my collection. Audio technically poor.\nAcoustics were like the recording was made in a wooden box.","6991":"garbage.... Amazon should be ashamed for selling such a low quality recording.","6992":"When you hear the GVB sing the song, it has a definite end. However, this performance track fades out; I wonder why GVB didn't make the track as sung by GVB.","6993":"This Barcode guy is pretty good. Can't wait to hear more. I hear this guy can also sweep. So sick","6994":"What the heck was that? Girl learn to sing. *S.A.D.","6995":"Sad.","6996":"Excellent Band.  I have 2 of their albums, this being my favorite.  Good midwestern 90's\/early 2000's midwestern rock.","6997":"OMG, I just listened to the sample of this soundtrack, and I honestly can't imagine sleeping to this, even if I was really, really tired. Much less using it to go to sleep if I was having insomnia....\n\nFor soundtracks that actually work, you want something with Binaural Beat Technology built in, and a soothing backgound sound. Excellent ones you can get from Amazon include Kelly Howell's one with the identical title, Slow Wave Sleep, with a ocean wave background. And if like me you find ocean wave sounds less than ideal, Kelly's Sound Sleep has a very restful musical background. Just type Kelly Howell into Amazon's search box.\n\nSadly, Amazon doesn't have samples of Kelly' soundtrack's on it's site, but Kelly's site does. Google BrainSync. You can listen to samples there, and buy an MP3 download cheaper than a CD. But if you want a cd rather than an MP3 download, come back here to buy it, since Kelly charges too much for shipping and still takes a while to deliver.\n\nIt's a matter of debate among producers of soundtracks, but some people claim that a CD will work better than a MP3 copy, since the binaural beats are compressed in a MP3. Possibly true, but the MP3s do work. Do they work as well as a CD? I really don't know....\n\nBe aware that these soundtracks are designed to slowly take you down into the sleep state, gradually going deeper and deeper. If you are having trouble going to sleep, listening to them will most likely get you there. Even if not, you will at least get very calm, which is much more restful than tossing and turning. But listening to them over and over all night will be counterproductive, since when the soundtrack starts over, it returns to the \"awake\" level, and then spends some time \"taking you down\" again.\n\nAnother use is when you need a \"nap\" in order to be awake and alert later, or simply don't have time for a full nights sleep. These soundtracks will help get you rested and energised.\n\nWarning: binaural beat technology works by putting different sound frequencies in each ear. So unless you have a stereo source, at least moderate hearing in each ear, and use stereo headphones they won't do anything at all.","6998":"One of the baddest party song in 1986, ever done by Cashflow.","6999":"I had the LP and one of the few that had great themes impossible to have in oyher form. When wil we have the CD?","7000":"Wonderful singer","7001":"I have the vinyl album from which this song was lifted so I know every note in the song.  The problem is that whoever made the mp3 failed to start it at the beginning of the song so the first bar or two is missing.  Instead of starting with the first note, the song fades in after the start.  It's annoying because I have the same song from the same album and I know how it begins.  This isn't it.  Someone did a sloppy job of ripping the cut from the album.","7002":"Waste of money! This song was only seconds long and not worth paying for.","7003":"This is the shortest song I have ever heard. By the time you read these two sentences ... the song is over.","7004":"I met Joe at a small concert in Tucson.... great guy, but anyway this is the best cover of the song I have ever heard..... better than the original !!!","7005":"I have the original album, but wanted to have Golden Wildwood Flower on a CD to listen to. Great instrumental album!!","7006":"BOOTLEGS. They do not own these recordings ad have no right to be selling them.","7007":"Avoid this \"remaster\" - not only is it mono, the mono audio we get is from one channel of the stereo mix...the guitar in the right channel of the original stereo vinyl is completely missing from \"When Sunny Gets Blue\", for example. Anyone who has ever heard the original Decca stereo LP (I own two good copies) will know right away something is way off. The tracks from this album that appear on the Geffen compilation \"Singin' & Swingin'\" are the proper stereo mixes, so good masters are evidently extant. It is a shame, as this is one of Earl Grant's finest sessions and really showcased his ability to wring emotion from a ballad...find a good copy of the vinyl and cue up \"Angel Eyes\"...simply gorgeous.","7008":"Great meditation background tunes!","7009":"The quality of this recording is pretty crappy.  It sounds like a really worn record being played on a really low quality record player.","7010":"Described as CD but was vinyl.  Returned for credit without problem.","7011":"Big Village calls their style \"tribal pop,\" which basically means that they produce funky rock with quirky lyrics, world music influences, full, female vocalist harmonies, and a great rhythm section with some African drums. If you can imagine a cross between the Talking Heads of \"Stop Making Sense\" (only less weird) and the Brand New Heavies (only without horns), you'll get the general idea. On the group's third album Up, singers Rachel-Ann Cross and Jaqui MacMillan, backed up by a stomping, soaring orchestra led by bassist Henry Cross, prove that hope is still alive, at least in the Washington D.C. suburb of Takoma Park, MD. Our ladies of song show that they are nothing but attitude -- good attitude, for a change. The lyrics are clever, as on the rhyming, silly song \"Whena, Whena\" or the poetic \"Woman on the Way to Heaven.\" Just when you're wondering where that world music influence went, it comes out in full force in the passionate Arabic-rock number \"Euphoria.\"\n\nThis is danceable, upbeat music for people who are attuned to the world around them. A gem. ~ Kurt Keefner, All Music Guide","7012":"like","7013":"Cars. I can't believe the guys recording this didn't move further from the road. You can't miss the cars passing by constantly in the background.","7014":"At first listen I was enchanted. Gradually it dawned on me, however, something didn't belong. It was the unmistakable sound of passing cars! The recording was made too close to a highway. What a shame!","7015":"It's what you expect. Rain and thunder sounds.","7016":"This new release from the multi-talented Deborah Allen if picked up by radio is sure to get her back on the charts!  She wrote and sings it, and it is a lament about love and loss which is sure to tug at your heart strings.","7017":"Unfortunately I missed the first review advising of this issue. This album should be a no buy. Someone has stuffed up majorly and the cd version is an utter joke with the speed issue.","7018":"I've been wanting to get this CD for years and it was hard to find, but I finally found it.  My favorite songs and \"Main Street\" and of course, \"Pacific Northwest Blues\" since I live in the Seattle area.","7019":"This album has been (and still is, as far as I'm concerned) way overdue for CD release. Not one of Randy Bachman's best efforts but still quite worthy,and I was thrilled to finally be getting a CD copy, as my vinyl is worn out. Unfortunately, this album was \"remastered\" at THE WRONG SPEED. \"Side One\" plays too fast, and all three vocalists sound like chipmunks. There is a humorous element to hearing the baritone growl of Fred Turner pitched up to alto, but overall a huge disappointment. I would normally grade this album at three to four stars, but until it's mastered at the right speed, it gets zero stars from me. Kinda weird that \"side two\" plays ok....I don't understand how \"half\" an album gets mastered wrong. Don't waste your money.\n\nThe seller was kind enough to refund my money, here's hoping this gets remastered correctly soon.","7020":"If you don't mind hearing audio out takes at the end of a song you won't mind this. I deleted it after listening once.","7021":"I had this hard to find lp years ago and was glad to get it back. Interesting, but not something I'll listen to a lot.","7022":"Great song and delivery","7023":"It brings back memories of being in my early teens and it's sweet. it's a sweet love song from the 90's","7024":"Full Disclosure:  I am a fan of Joanna Angel and her Burning Angel Entertainment business.\n\nThis song was purchased because I was curious.  Would it live up to my expectations?  Can Joanna really hold a tune?  Does this song get stuck in your head frequently?  Yes, yes, and yes!  I really enjoy listening to this song and will for many times to come. It's very catchy, just have to stop myself sometimes when I am out in public from singing too loud... I have resorted to humming it whenever possible.  All in all, this song is a welcomed addition to my music collection.  Great job!  (Like all of her other work, obviously... since I already said that I'm a fan of hers and BA).","7025":"This is just a short verbal introduction of Shawn and Verlon with no music.  Is this my download error or it is the publisher's error?","7026":"I like it.","7027":"It's a great song, but I've heard much better live versions","7028":"Lovely verse and music meant to inspire and uplift you spiritually. The lyrics are subtle, and not overtly religious, but inspiring when listened to closely.","7029":"I don't consider myself a big fan of Mute Math. I have a couple of their songs, saw them play at a free music fest downtown this summer - enjoyed them a lot. I heard this song on the radio and liked it enough to write down a snippet to look it up later. Turned out to be them. I don't know whether it's good or bad I didn't immediately recognise them, but there's nothing wrong with a band evolving in style.","7030":"Imo, this is one of Mutemath's worst songs to date. I don't care if it's the single, people will eat up what is popular. But to a Mutemath fan, this is very bland and uninspiring. The chorus is, \"Blood Pressure, do better....keep rising, blood pressure.\" Boring. It just sounds like every other retro 70s rock band out there right now. Mutemath is better than that and I hope their next album goes back to the atmospheric rock sound. They are just too good at it to just completely abandon it.","7031":"The guys of MUTEMATH are extremely talented. But I'm just not digging their new sound at all. This isn't what brought me in to the beautiful rock that MM was. The self-titled album had some of the most amazing songs I've ever heard by a band. Armistice had its gems too. But this new album seems like they're reverting back to the 70s. I just miss that atmospheric rock sound that MM had that made them one of my favorite bands. After listening to the new album, I can say I am thoroughly disappointed. \"All or Nothing\" and \"In No Time\" are amazing tracks. Other than that, all the songs sound pretty much the same. Crazy drum fills along with 70s style guitar riffs. If you were a fan of their previous albums\/sound, be careful. This is nothing like how they were.....and that's a bad thing.","7032":"Simply put, she was at the peak of her career.  A must have for any fan.  You can't go wrong.  You,all fall in love with her all over again.","7033":"I just about cry every time I hear this song. It is truly, truly lovely. Sometimes when a recording is live you hear a lot of audience chit chat or general distractions, but that's not the case here. You wouldn't even know it was live except for the clapping at the end. Beautiful. I just wish the song were longer :)","7034":"Brought me into the presence of the Lord. She has a beautiful voice","7035":"I bought the MP-3 of Adeste Fidelis from the album SOUNDIES'HOLIDAY by Frankie Laine and the Ewing Sisters, only the Ewing Sisters were omitted. This is the second piece of music I 've bought in which the Ewing Sisters were credited but nonexistant on the recordings. The other omission was on the album The Best of Gordon MacRae The Early Years in the song Use Your Imagination. I had mentioned this in an earlier Written Review. I would have listened to the MP-3 prior to buying it but my computer was on the \"Fritz\". I'm collecting music by the Ewing Sisters and I expect to hear them When they are credited on a recording. Frnakie at least was on the recording. I gave him two stars.<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Adeste-Fidelis\/dp\/B00A994MI8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Adeste Fidelis<\/a>","7036":"This album is well worth the price, Reely Jiggered hits the nail on the head with great Celtic tunes and wonderful musicianship!!","7037":"I love this song it is right now one of my favorites and I am a great fan of their music and this is a great buy at a reasonable price","7038":"Oh, this was a terrible recording.  They sound like they are singing from the bottom of a tin can.","7039":"Great song!","7040":"Great song","7041":"Not like the original!!","7042":"Wow, now this is BAD prog!  From the first song with the cheesy chipmunk sounding electric keyboards (I guess a synthesizer or something along those lines), the 3rd song - the majority of which sounds like a melody or riff taken from an early King Crimson song, bad vocals, to the overall cheesy sounding pompous nature of the keyboard effects, lyrics, and overall sound.  It does get somewhat better when you get to I guess what was the final song on the original release (What Is  Is What, the 4th track on the CD) and the following final song, which I guess is a bonus 5th track added to this Japanese import.  The last song is just some electronic doodling (instrumental), but listenable (sort of reminds me of Kit Watkins or someone like that).  I think this was supposed to be their second and last release that actually was not released until a few years after it was recorded.  After hearing it, Im surprised it was released at all; but like I indicated the 4th song, which I guess was side 2 of the original vinyl clocking in at 19:51 minutes, is somewhat listenable (I say only somewhat).  I was thinking about also getting their first release, but NOT anymore after hearing this one.","7043":"Great album. If you get the chance to see him live, you'd will be seeing one heck of a show!","7044":"An absolute feel good song! It is contagious and addictive! Margo Rey has such a beautiful unique voice. To indulge yourself in her music is definitely an adventure of a lifetime. Whatever you do don't stop at just this song. Please listen to Colours, which is a song about bullying but it find particularly inspirational. And then there is a course A Holiday Night which is sure to become a favorite Christmas classic. :)","7045":"10 out of 10  Great musician ,  great music,","7046":"It was not the whole song, but a shorten version","7047":"My husband loves Chuck Brown's music - this made an awesome ringtone for him!\nOf course I'm the one who gets to enjoy it, not him...!","7048":"I remember the Huck A Bucks back in the day.  Donnie Simpson used to play this song on WKYS 3 or 4 times a day!","7049":"All of you old school D.C. folks out there will remember Little Benny and how great a performer he was. This is one his most well known songs. We miss you \"shorty\". RIP.","7050":"Disappointing. I went to listen to a sample and somehow ordered the whole album. I tried to listen to it and just didn't care for it. I wish there was a way o return this for my money back.","7051":"This album is inexpensive, has some great songs on there and is good for anything you need to do requiring some relaxation or contemplation. I use it in the morning for waking, I use it for studying, I use it for relaxing, just about anything where I need to focus.","7052":"FYI - This great album (David Gates' 5th solo album) has NEVER been issued\/pressed on CD by ANY label ANYWHERE in the world. Any copy on CD is a home-made version, bootleg, etc. I acquired one on another site for $20 around 2010 that was quite decent, but definitely not legit. The sound was pretty good; the artwork was re-created below average.","7053":"classic boosie song. not too many rappers speak on the hardships of life, but he really made a mark with this song. one of the best \"real\" rappers since tupac.

Should have known better.  Oh well.","7055":"mistake. Not my fairy-tale. And Meiko its my love.","7056":"I first found out about Daniela through a friend, who recommended I listen to her album.  I wasn't disappointed - what an amazing voice!  She has the pureness and range that send chills down your spine.  This will be just the beginning for this amazing songstress.  I'm looking forward to hearing her next album!","7057":"Great LP.But why is it recorded at 45 rpm's","7058":"I was expecting the version with mixed in vocals.  This was instrumental only.","7059":"I love this band so much! I saw them in concert at a comicon and it was amazing! If you like k-pop, i suggest them, even though they are j-pop.","7060":"I love Grace and her  the drummer.","7061":"A short release, yet full!  Recreating the sound of the archaic arched harp is not easy, yet Levy makes it seem that way through his prolific output and attention to detail.  I love to listen to this music while I read or study, but I recommend it for careful listening as well.  Wonderful stuff.","7062":"Roo is a very talented song writer.. His songs are written from his heart and blend together with his musical talent to make this an exceptional CD. His background band compliments his songs without over powering his voice. Each song is unique and I want to play them over and over again. This CD will definitely be found in my friend's Christmas Stockings.\nBonnie Chelini","7063":"If you don't know this band, you should.... LOVE them!!!!","7064":"nice, got this song for my wife. made for a perfect mood at home with my wife. I like her.","7065":"I love the music and the lyrics and it just touches me... Especially when thinking in the context of the trilogy. I recommend reading the books and then listening to these songs too, it's just... beautifully perfect.","7066":"the description says Pierre et le Loup (Peter and the Wolf) so you might think you will receive the full story but this is only the introduction.  Make sense for the price\/length but I would have prefer a better description of the product!","7067":"Impossible to listen to.  I could not distinguish the words.  I was expecting something other than the loud noise.  I could not see its relevance to Transience.","7068":"Dom DeLuise is great, and the guy singing Rumpelstiltskin is good, but there's a lot of bad singing in this show, and too many weak songs.","7069":"Jamie Lawson's music is stunning and I'm so excited to learn about him. I saw him on tour with Ed Sheeran and he was incredible, but I wish he had performed some songs from this album.","7070":"Ah yes, a CD with old, poor quality (content and sounding) interviews along with 2 unfunny yet offensive parody songs.  If you are of Asian decent, you may want to avoid this CD....actually, if you are not hearing impaired, you may want to avoid this CD.  Take the ten bucks and donate it to charity or add Tabasco and eat your sawbuck, it'll be more pleasurable than listening to Caucasian Man.","7071":"My sons 1st. grade assembly performance was better than this.\n\nGot more information out of a homeless man on the street.\n\nCutting up the 13.99 would have been more enjoyable.","7072":"...and who the hell is the target audience for this stale product? Middle-aged white racists who make a ton of money but are eager to prove themselves as \"working class\"? North is a fraud and shameless self-promoter. This CD is a rip-off and I believe it exists only because no one had the guts to tell Mr. North it was a bad idea.\n\nTell you what: give your money to a favored charity in lieu of supporting the man who single-handedly destroyed the greatest sports talk radio station in America & uses 50,000 watts of power to spew his prejudices and political naivete.\n\nNorth seeks attention like a child; don't encourage him and perhaps he'll quiet down and fade away into the ether of once-great Chicago radio personalities.","7073":"I used to be one of North's biggest fans, but this CD just showed me how wrong I was to his critics.  Who cares about old interviews and 2 awful parodies.  Secret Asian Man?  Caucasian Man?  These songs are old and played out.  A parody is lost on the listeners if 75% of your target audience were born after the original song's release date.  Please Mike, if their is going to be another CD, put more effort into it.","7074":"Just in case you don't know, this is the radio edit version (no swears or offensive words). I had no idea b\/c I'd linked to Amazon from the uncensored music video on YouTube. Other than that, the song's good (full version, good quality, etc) and it plays in my portable & computer mp3 players.","7075":"Burning Sky Records - the label that has already released killer tributes to Jellyfish, The Posies, Roxy Music (with a tribute to NZ's Toy Love coming in September) - is back with their most ambitious tribute yet.  If I.... If I... If I... The Songs of Squeeze Revisited is a 4-disc, 50-track album covering Squeeze's first four albums (U.K Squeeze, Cool For Cats, Argybargy, and East Side Story) in their entirety and in their original track sequence.  Check out the songs of Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook in a whole new light - it is a fabulous listen!  (The 4-CD album is ONLY available from the Burning Sky Records website).\n\nReleased in 1977, the John Cale-produced U.K. Squeeze introduced the world to the magic of Squeeze.  The album presented Squeeze at their wildest - they had an edge to their sound that was unique to this record.\n\nCovering an album like U.K. Squeeze would be a challenge.  We strove to capture the wild abandon of the original album while giving fresh life to each of its songs.  Here's a brief take on the tracks, with some thoughts from the bands\/artists themselves:\n\n1.) Sex Master - After a gorgeous, Jellyfish-esque opening, US band Steve Sizemore Group rocks the heck out of the album opener, with guitar, piano and Hammond organ all \"rocking it out like the world was coming to an end.\"\n\n2.) Bang Bang - UK band Keshco provides a fun, quirky take on the song, \"playing up the whimsy in the verses and the yearning in the choruses,\" with a \"funk-out at the end\" to \"top off all that pent-up frustration.\"\n\n3.) Strong In Reason - US artist Christopher Watson provides an updated New Wave take on the track.  \"What started out sweet and tentative became edgy, taut, and mechanical,\" Chris says. The track also features cool angular guitar from Trees' Dane Conover.\n\n4.) Wild Sewerage Tickles Brazil - Japanese band Penny and Ashtray take a surreal approach to the album's lone instrumental - they strove to \"represent the song's alter ego in a parallel world.\"  Their cover has all of the delicious creepiness of the original version.\n\n5.) Out Of Control - Speaking of \"creepiness,\" US band Trees amps up the creepiness appropriate to the lyric while at the same time making a very catchy cover.  Trees' Dane Conover wanted listeners to have \"little beads of sweat trickle down their forehead\" when listening to this one.\n\n6.) Take Me I'm Yours - US band (by way of England) Sartre's Lobster give this classic Squeeze track a decidedly Middle Eastern feel, using the song's \"lyrics about bellydancers, camels and the Golden East\" as a starting point, swirling with a \"a kind of '70s, vaguely Led Zeppelin-esque vibe.\"\n\n7.) The Call - US band Robert Mag & The Number Nine put a powerful, Bowie-esque slant on this track, rocking it up more than the original version - very cool stuff.\n\n8.) Model - UK band The Slingsby Hornets amp up the energy on this track, employing \"a Brian May multi layered guitar feel, over a 90s influenced Redd Kross style powerpop\/glam backing, with the addition of a few analogue synth sounds.\"\n\n9.) Remember What - Spanish (by way of the US) artist Amelia Ray considered numerous potential approaches to the song, \"but the funk won out\" on this inspired cover. The majority of the song is sung in 7\/8 time, with the bridges switching to 4\/4.  It is funky indeed!\n\n10.) First Thing Wrong - US band Ocean of Algebra \"took a very loose and open approach to the song, and \"ended up getting kind of an Ocean of Algebra does the New York Dolls does Squeeze type of sound.\"  Singer Jim Hiskey's vocal is not to be missed!\n\n11.) Hesitation (Rool Britannia) - US artist D A Karkos takes what I always felt was a so-so song from U.K. Squeeze and turns it into something amazing. Karkos says, \"My approach to this song was pretty simple. I wanted to make it more of a hard rock song and less of a jam. Slowing the down the tempo and coming up with a new riff that worked over the original chord progression seemed to do the trick.\"  I'll say!  This cover is flat-out sick!\n\n12.) Get Smart - US artist Wayne Cabral closes the disc with a blistering take on the track, dialing up the energy while maintaining the \"punkabilly\" feel of the original.  Clocking in at just over 2 minutes, this track (and disc) will leave you wanting more!  Good thing there are 3 more discs to go... :)","7076":"The nuttiest, crunchiest, hardest, softest, rubberiest, grimiest bass I've ever heard. Well done.","7077":"Classical music suffers most from MP3 format....but I didn't have this on CD so....there is an audible digital pop at the intro of the first movement....i removed it myself w\/ editor program I own....","7078":"This cd is nuts","7079":"Great  70's Music  Plus The Voice  Of  Dionne Warwick","7080":"I've been listening to these folks ever since they were based in HI.  Great album!  Can't wait for the next!","7081":"If you are really into dub-step with some intense drop beats then this is definitely the song for you. I play it when I am hauling down the slopes skiing.","7082":"Rubinstein is great, and I love his Chopin in general.  But the recording quality is horrible; it sounds like a vinyl record left out in the sun a little to long -- wobbly around the edges, wavery sound on the long notes, and so on.  Avoid this, or at least listen before you buy","7083":"Always puts out good music!","7084":"Downloaded well.","7085":"Never heard of the Damn Quails before, but they were recommended by Amazon based on some other music I had purchased. I bought this CD  based on that and listening to some of the previews sound loops. I was not at all disappointed. The CD is excellent from beginning to end. The Dam Quails are great song crafters and superb musicians. If you like bands like the Jayhawks, Turnpike Troubadours and others in that vein, you will love this band and this CD.","7086":"Great song, great artist. She has a beautiful voice that I can listen to at any time. The quality of the download is great, no fuzziness or glitches.","7087":"Only received a small piece of the song... Saw these guys live in Fayetteville, NC and loved them. Never had a problem downloading before, but this was money wasted to me","7088":"expected more variation. that did not occur.  Maybe it is alright for those who are messages others in a tranquil state of mind.","7089":"Got this for my son - he really likes it","7090":"Totally.","7091":"ok","7092":"Sometimes the most simplistic, mundane, unimaginative, monotonous, obtuse songs are big hits ... so this one certainly has a chance.","7093":"This song reminded me of my wife and I.  It came out about the time we started dating and it fit us then and still does.","7094":"I'm still trying to figure out how to return it, and get it off my play list.  The music was beautiful in the few seconds of the preview.  But the singing is awful.  I think the sample should be about 10 seconds longer.","7095":"We used to hear this occasionally on the way to school on Kids Place Live (XM).  My daughter loved this song, I downloaded it from Amazon onto my phone and she wore my battery down listening to it over and over.  The song is very good and imaginative, constantly switching up styles and beats, we have listened to it very often since I bought it and we haven't gotten tired of it yet.  It is not repetitive, and it does not have any tween\/teen themes (thinking about Justin Beiber as one example.)\n\nThis beats a lot of the kids music genre that I have heard by a long shot.  I have bought the rest of this album based solely on this song.","7096":".....I was expecting something quite different.....don't kno if it was me and my expectations or was this not a good example...","7097":"favorite song\nmy kids love it\nand dance to it .\nall the time .\nit makes me feel good","7098":"I couldn't hear the drum beats of the music the original song is way different than this one need the og","7099":"I JUST LOVE THESE SONGS THIS IS A GREAT ZUMBA SONG AND IT JUST GETS YOU IN THE MOOD TO DANCE AND WORKOUT A WHILE HAVING A GREAT TIME THIS SONG IS A GREAT SONG TO GET YOU IN THAT MOOD OF DANCING","7100":"No, this is not an SACD.","7101":"very pleased","7102":"Outstanding collection with some really exceptional performances. Highly recommended.","7103":"Lisa's crack at the U.S. charts between her \"So Natural\" (not released in North America) and \"Lisa Stansfield\" albums, this \"Beverly Hills 90210\" soundtrack release was pretty smooth, pretty sexy.. It definitely fits with Lisa's signature sound, despite not having been written by her or Ian Devaney. The remixes (by Kenny \"Dope\" Gonzalez and R. Kelly) spice things up as well. Unfortunately, something was still missing and the song did not make much impact on black or pop charts (actually it is hard to pinpoint it as either genre). I like this track but it definitely comes across as weaker than her other material. Then again, weaker for Lisa Stansfield means Grade \"A\" quality compared to other artists out there! Definitely still worth getting for the 6 track promo cd with all the versions!","7104":"The product is DEFECTIVE.  It does not contain the entire concert.  Songs are cut off before the ending, start in the middle.  This should not be sold or bought under any circumstances.","7105":"The sound quality (of what i heard, anyway) was good. But the recording was incomplete. It is a 12 minute recording, and i only have the LAST half of it (approximately 8 minutes).","7106":"Starts with a piano banger, and goes no where from there.  Repetitious droning, relentlessly monotone.  Oh, and by the way, you can't raise the dead.","7107":"I thought it would be great, but I didn't care for it. Hope you like that kind of music, as I don't.","7108":"It's about time I shared my life-changing experience with three of Michael J. Emery's recordings:\n\n1.  Complete Confidence 2.0\n2.  Put Off Procrastination\n3.  Sheer Resolve To Do What It Takes\n\n- Did these three recordings alone change everything? No.\n\n- Did they start me, and then keep me, on a path I was previously unlikely to take or stay on without them? Yes!\n\n- Had I tried similar recordings, such as hypnosis and books, to accomplish the same things, and did Emery's recordings prove by far the most effective? Yes!\n\nAt the time of this writing, September 17, 2015, I have never met nor communicated with Michael J. Emery. This testimonial comes from the influence of the recordings themselves, listened to over a period of about a year.\n\nThe two elements I believe stand these recordings out from others like them are:\n\n1) The music and sound effects that accompany Emery's verbal instructions and imagery. The music is, in my experience, simultaneously relaxing and stimulating. In fact, listening intently, fully conscious, to each of these recordings and their instructions at least twice is an excellent way to learn how to call upon their techniques during a normal workday without the recordings.\n\n2) The most effective image\/sound effect for me personally, in any audio recording I've ever listened to, is an \"ice cube\" metaphor on \"Complete Confidence 2.0\" designed to gather, freeze, and put away all thoughts of previous failure, so that I could proceed building confidence without mental hang-ups from the past. My unconscious truly responded to this metaphor.\n\nWith these recordings, I was able to build \"Complete Confidence\" in a way I had not been able to sustain before under pressure.\n\nThis prompted me to \"Put Off Procrastination\" and act on a number of decisions I had waffled over before, which prompted me within a short time to seek out and then join a public speaking club which I still belong to, and led me soon after to apply for promotion to a leadership position I had not fully seized the first time it had come around, increasing my income significantly.\n\nFor those with a \"fear of success\" similar to what I felt for many years before seeking out and listening to these recordings, I won't lie to you - bold decisions lead to responsibilities that can be difficult to stick with once assumed. \"Sheer Resolve To Do What It Takes\" kept me on the path, bolstered me in refusing to give up, and kept me focused on thriving rather than just \"getting through\" challenging situations.\n\n\"Complete Confidence\" continued to bolster that indispensable element, and \"Put Off Procrastination\" continued to provide tangible effects that prompted me to act on, and drive steadily to completion (or lead others steadily to completion), important tasks that had lost momentum but still needed to be done.","7109":"was free...","7110":"I like these various artists collections - very smart to offer it free. I ended up buying this artists MP3.","7111":"The samples turned me off. I wanted very much to be pleased, but I wasn't. A much more traditional arrangement of the various rhymes would I believe sell in huge quantities!","7112":"An absolutely wonderful piece- so glad I got it. Wonderful for relaxing & spending those precious minutes in prayer or just to have a mental reset.","7113":"Didn't like it. Different strokes for different folks!\nDifficult to follow creators direction\n Annoying sound couldn't even stand to finish listening whole track","7114":"This is a review to Verdi's La Traviata, recorded in 1941.  I see it is already attached to La Boheme, and Lord knows where else, by Amazon.  It is their doing, not mine.  Now about this Traviata ...\n\nI am a big fan of Jan Peerce and particularly regretful of the fact I didn't go hear him live, although I had the chance staring me in the eyes and stepping on my toes.  It was about 1980 and he was doing Traviata at Scottsdale Center for the Arts.  I was all dressed up and ready to go, and then I read a review in the paper which said it was ridiculous to have a 76-year-old Alfredo hobbling around the stage with a cane.  And so, because I was stupid, I thought, oh dear--I don't want anyone to see me there, if the reviewer thought it was bad.  And so I missed out.  Now he is dead, and the moral of the story is:  don't be stupid, and miss out.\n\nWell, this particular recording is interesting in a way, but mostly because it's surprisingly mundane.  Peerce is Peerce, he does a great job, but there's nothing shocking or new.  If you have Toscanini, then you have Peerce (in much better sound).\n\nLet us put to rest the very pleasant myth that everything that came from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera, during the Golden Age, was automatically a masterpiece.  This is without a doubt the scrappiest (note the politically-expedient leading 's' on my chosen adjective) Traviata ever to come from a leading house.  The conducting is uninspired, to put it charitably.  The tempos are mostly S-L-O-O-W-W, and it is simple time-beating.  Now when I say 'mostly' slow, that implies that some of it is not slow.  That is true.  The Dr. scene is the most hurried Dr. scene ever to grace wax.  This guy was REALLY late to a golf appointment, or maybe he had to go to the little boy's room.  Whatever it was, he had to get the heck outa there, FAST.\n\nAbout the Violetta, who I have never heard of (not that that means anything).  She is labeled as a soprano, but I swear has the beautiful, well-rounded voice of a mezzo.  And guess what else?  She doesn't do any top notes.  Have you ever heard a Violetta who avoided the top notes?  I'm not saying it's bad, but certainly is unusual.  There is something else a little different.  She uses some different words.  In Fors'e lui, she doesn't sing \"Gioir! Gioir!\", she sings \"Aaaaaah! Aaaaah!\"  And there are other words she uses in certain areas, but I don't know what they are.  That is certainly different.\n\nAltogether it is an unsettling Violetta and I will have to say, if she could sing Violetta at the Met, so frankly could any of the talented ladies singing Violetta at community opera I know with no apologies whatsoever.\n\nLawrence Tibbett is father Germont, and I am sure you are aware he is one of the greatest baritones of the 20th century.  He is giving it everything he has, and it actually detracts.  Yes, I am afraid it is an odd mix to put him in this mediocre production.  It is like having a New York Steak with potato chips and diet orange soda on the side.\n\nThe score has been cut, of course.  The standard cuts are taken, and then some.  Even the parts of the two messengers ('La signora e partita', and 'Una dama d'un cocchio') are cut.  Alfredo just asks who's there, then proceeds to read the letter.  So you are telling me at the Metropolitan Opera they didn't have anyone who could take these 10-second messenger parts?\n\nNow about the sound.  The sound is very good for the age, up until the last act.  Of course, it is not as good as Toscanini of 1946, but then again, nothing of that era is.  It's certainly as good as, actually better than, the live Callas Traviatas of 15 years later.  Then beginning the last act, there is an annoying series of ticks or bumps that won't go away.  When it first starts, one might say it's not too bad.  But it goes on the whole act, and it strains the limits of tolerability.\n\nSo the good stuff here is Peerce as Alfredo, which can be best enjoyed with Toscanini, and Tibbett as Germont, which is better enjoyed with Ponselle.  The rest of it is altogether 'meh'.  Of course, it is cheap, but the question is, do you want to spend the time and sanity when there are SO MANY truly excellent Traviatae out there??","7115":"Not as good as the youtube videos of James Bryan playing it solo.","7116":"Great Mardi Gras song!

The audio improves as the piece moves along, but the beginning of the music is a turn-off.","7158":"Heard these on a music channel. Decided to purchase them. Amazon has a good selection and is easy to use.","7159":"Ordered by mistake.","7160":"The songs on THESE ARMS contain a number of influences - folk, country, blues, Cajun (reflecting Mark's heritage).  One of the wonderful things about this talented duo is how seamlessly they can blend these, sometimes within an individual song, into a viable whole that is simply great music that not only touches the soul of listeners, but brings nourishment to their minds as well...not to mention inducing them to a good bit of foot-tapping in the process...and the urge to dance.\n\nSeven out of the eleven tunes on this album are Mark Viator originals, and they clearly illustrate what a fine writer he is.  He's also a very talented guitarist - almost all of the guitar work on the recording is Mark's.  Whether he's fingerpicking or flatpicking, or playing slide, it's always masterful and appropriate, and never showy for the sake of it - it's all about the music and what supports it best and conveys the mood.  When Mark shifts from accompanying lyrics to adding a spot of lead, the seamlessness is wonderful to behold.  If you're fortunate enough to see them perform live (which we do every chance we get), you'll understand this even more. The songs here that were written by others (Thad Beckman, Robert Earl Keen, Kate Wolf and Hank Williams) are as well-chosen as the originals are well-written, and suit Mark and Susan to a T.\n\nMark's Cajun heritage is never far from the surface.  `Queen of the bayou' is a heartfelt tribute to his grandmother, a tasty stew of memories and love.  `Ain't goin back' is an honest look at the life of a proud Louisiana working man, a vivid picture of resilience and devotion to family.  `Dharma bums', as one might gather from the title, was inspired by Jack Kerouac's novel, and wonders eloquently if the idealism the book inspired in many of us when we read it the first time can be carried and kept alive as our lives move along.  Susan's voice carries Mark's original `These arms' to sweet heights - it's a beautiful love song, extremely moving, and one you'll find yourself humming it before you realize it.  Her renditions of Kate Wolf songs (`Across the Great Divide' appears here), as well as those of country legends such as Hank Williams (`I'm so lonesome I could cry' gets a beautiful reading on this album) and Patsy Cline (if you're lucky enough to see them perform, ask for `Walkin after midnight'), are all nothing short of wonderful, and Robert Earl Keen's `I would change my life' illustrates that she can give new life to more contemporary songs.  She makes everything she sings her own, reaching down into her artist's soul to color them with shades from her own palette.  When the two of them blend their voices, the harmonies are perfect and the chemistry is intimate - you can get a sense of it from just listening, but again, seeing them perform in a live setting makes it abundantly clear that they love what they're doing.\n\nMany of Austin's finest musicians lend their talents to this recording.  It never feels over-crowded, rather like a conversation among good friends, where everyone has something to contribute but no one attempts to dominate.  Every track flows easily along, without production getting in the way of the material.  As I said earlier, this is simply great music - well-written, performed with heart and talent, and a complete joy to experience.  Pass it up at your peril.  I don't think I'm allowed to insert a link to their website here, but if you do a search for them, you'll find it - there are samples available there, and you'll hear what I mean.  If you like what you hear - and if you enjoy great music, I feel sure you will - check out Mark's earlier solo album BAYOU TCHE, filled with more finely-crafted original songs (one co-written by another great Austin-based songwriter, Slaid Cleaves), and his solo acoustic guitar offering WIRE & WOOD, showcasing his instrumental talents.  They're both excellent.","7161":"Such a help when I'm stressed and my thoughts can't calm down!","7162":"I think the reviewers must either be friends of the artist or have never heard any other rap before...but this is just horrible. I'm sorry to say.\n\nFirst...the rapper has no flow and stays to the one style the entire album.  Second, the beats themselves while bangin' seem to be recycled through out the album.\n\nI know this is his first album, but if you got skillz, it'll show on your first release...but this album just doesn't have that. At all.  I'm sorry, but save yourself the money and buy something else.","7163":"Awesome song!","7164":"If you play video games you NEED to listen to this song","7165":"Josienne's voice is captivating--truly beautiful and easy to lose yourself in it. This album is a wonderful compilation of original songs. Her guitar playing is crisp and clear. Overall the album is a true joy!","7166":"I bought this for my dog because fireworks petrify him and I wanted him to get used to the sounds before the 4th of July.  I played the CD for him every night and then gave him his favorite treats.  After just one week he seems much calmer than when I first played the sounds.  They are very lifelike with whistles and super loud pops.  Excellent sound quality for whatever your reasons are for buying this CD.","7167":"As a fan of the show, and owner of the entire series on dvd I can say this box set is well worth getting. I also own most of the other next gen cds, as I'm a completist. It's presented well. One of the highlights of the set is the huge booklet which talks about each episode presented. Lots of colour photos. It talks also about each composer. One composer for the first 2 discs, then guest composers for the third plus extras and alternate takes. I liked hearing Picard's voice on the main title. It would be great to get some more naration in other soundtracks. I always thought that It would be a good idea. Scary, light hearted, comical, soaring and interesting is some of the words I could use to discribe the music. A track from \"The Big Goodbye\" was one of my favourite pieces as I like music from film noir and detective stories from the 1940's. I think the music from the next generation is magical, exciting, futuristic and cutting edge like the visuals in the show.","7168":"Horrible  Extremely poor quality recording.  Sounds Tinny, shallow.  background louder than foreground sound","7169":"Sangre's new album the Great Tribulation is seriously one of the Best Metal albums I've bought in 2011. I like every song on here. The songs are really heavy and make you want to Headbang until your head falls off. Every song is great but if I had to pin Point my favorites they would be the first track \"Vengeance\" It's straight up Death Metal with some Black Metal elements added to it. The Vocalist growls mixed in with his High Pitch Black Metal Screams makes this song stand up to it's name. It's full of bloody Vengeance.\nThe Title track \"The Great Tribulation\" intro riff is sick! Another very Death Metal and Black Metal influenced track thrown in with some very Gutenberg Swedish Melo Death inspired riffing reminiscent of At The Gates mixed in with some Dissection.  Very Heavy but Melodic at the same time. Another stand out if I had to chose, and trust me it's hard to pick a song cause they are all brutal and awesome would be \"Forever I\" This song if I had to describe it would be Thrash Metal meets Tool. This song is really heavy and makes you want to thrash and get stoned! The vocalist mixes in his growls and screams with his melodic vocals. Not many Metal vocalist can pull this off but his voice is great. hahahaha. Sangre mixes their Thrash Metal\/Death\/Black Metal influences really well with the great Melody of Swedish melo death with a dash of progressive Metal. Seriously all 13 tracks make you want to headbang and circle pit. Also the Drumming is freaken excellent. Great crazy Fills through out the songs. Reminds me of Danny Carey Meets Dave McClain of Machine Head on crack with great Blast Beats and Double Peddle Action! Oh and to top it off, The Bass is actually played the way it should be, playing along to the Drummer! I GIVE SANGRE'S THE GREAT TRIBULATION 10 OUT OF 1O! METAL AT IT'S FINEST. i WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO FANS OF TOOL, MACHINE HEAD, SLAYER, AT THE GATES, PANTERA. I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL HEAVY METAL FANS! THIS ALBUM REALLY MIXES IN WELL ALL THE DIFFERENT GENRES OF HEAVY METAL! FOR FANS OF THRASH,DEATH, BLACK METAL AND JUST METAL PERIOD!","7170":"Can not get it to download to my music very unique happy","7171":"good song","7172":"Very very dissapointed. Not a full song. No warning that it wasn't a full song. I should be entitled to a refund.","7173":"i love the music but the music record has problem\nits not clear the voice has problem\ni need the songs more clear i can't hear what the people singing","7174":"Excellent Song! I had the pleasure of hearing it performed live in San Francisco. If you like the song then you're going to love to hear it performed live! Indeed, this song is even better live! Keep up the great work God Module!","7175":"VERY sweet!","7176":"This CD is great if you are learning Ballroom dance. It has a good variety of songs, from waltz, foxtrot, chacha, rumba and more. I bought it because I was talking a ballroom dance class and needed music to practice with, each song tells you the style. For a few styles they give to two songs with different speeds. There is a slower waltz and a fast waltz etc. Have fun!","7177":"Not as good as reboot! But. Not bad either, a few tracks didn't down load, incompatible with my mobile device.","7178":"The title is a misnomer.  100 in spanish is the same as 100 in english.  It is like a Karaoke version of all the songs,  Not worth the $9.00.","7179":"It's very good I just like any thing with hatsune miku in it","7180":"Another live performance version, not indicated.  And the sample is too short to figure it out.  If you're looking for the original version, download the one on the Men at Work  \"Business as Usual\" album.","7181":"Very little breathing, moaning, orgasm sounds. Background music not erotic or stimulating.","7182":"It is a spam, it is just the greatest hits two with a different name listing, do not buy this","7183":"if there were less thank one star i would give it, but instead i'll give this warning:  this is grounded in NEW AGE and HINDU traditions.  Yoga is a meditative state to summon Hindu spirits - you simply cannot have one without the other.  ask ANY real yogi and he will tell you flat out.  STAY AWAY FROM blends of cr@p that call themselves \"CHRISTIAN\".  honor God and pray for wisdom and discernment.","7184":"This is one of the classics that I seem to never get enough of.","7185":"Ian first met Bob Dylan.... and they soon took off from there.  The Ian and Sylvia I know.... were solid folk music people.... no rodeo... no country. This one's a good example of that.... and shows what range and ability the 2 of them had. Back in the 60's other beatnicks would here their music... get their guitars out... and actually improve the melody and add to it.  This oldie brought back memories of just how much talent there was during those times.\nRussell","7186":"David Acton's voice and the words of the song speak to my very heart and soul.","7187":"I gave two stars because I was hoping for Garlands voice along with the guitar.\nThe Guitar was exceptionally done well, I was hoping for voice too.","7188":"I love the Israel Iz Kamakawiwo'ole  version of Over the rainbow...  I needed something recognizable , yet flowing for a background to a slide show... this worked, plus I can sing a long with it","7189":"Love this track. Just so catchy and fun. The original is excellent too with soome nice harmonies. Not sure how this or orig wasn't a massive hit. if it was I guess I missed it.","7190":"Didn't  like it","7191":"Waste of money. First of all, this is all instrumental, so nobody actually sings in Italian. Most of the songs have absolutely nothing to do with Italy. For the most part, the sounds like a MIDI generated performance piece. Perhaps the person who compiled it was Italian, but otherwise it was a waste of money.","7192":"The music is pretty but way too short for any meaningful meditation session.  Perhaps it could be put on an MP3 player and used for a one or two minute deep breathing session to calm oneself during a tense moment at work before going into a meeting.","7193":"Bad investment!\nI could have recorded a better quality version with my phone.","7194":"A blissful blend of reggae, hip hop, rock and roll, jazz fusion, electronica and Jam...and thats just one song! These folks are amazing live, devoted to their fans, and so service oriented that it flows throughout this music with ease. Every tune is accessible and the musicianship is faultless. This disc is one in a string of great discs from a Minneapolis based band that sponsors it own festivals in southern Minnesota, and gets out and about just briefly every fall to tour the midwest. If they get close to you, DO NOT MISS!","7195":"The music is a bit fast for me but I would say the music works.","7196":"I found this album to be not very motivational for me - during my workouts, I felt compelled to skip to the next track to find a good beat to work out to.  Most of the tracks have a tempo around 132 - 136 beats per minute, which doesn't fit my walking or running cadences (I need 120 beats per minute for walking & 150 bpm for running).  Still, I tried using it for my gym workouts (weights\/calisthenics), but I just couldn't get into any of the songs.  Perhaps the most motivational thing about this is the girl on the album cover...","7197":"I am sorry.  But if you are suppose to study to Brahams Lullaby, I believe you haven't put much though into this product.  Do not recommend this track for studying one bit-  some of these songs are what I believe to be a prank.\n\nGood luck with studying - you will do better with out listening to this poor product.","7198":"I don't know how this type of poorly executed covers of classical music can help you study. The piano tracks are particularly terrible, with missing notes, accidental key presses, and a rythm that sounds off tempo. The selection is great, but the execution is poor.","7199":"Max Soelzer's album - comfortable like a favorite leather jacket, broken and fitting. Utilizing mastery of the Gospel theme and his own brand of creativity - hinting at Buffett here, Santana there, Influenced by blues on one track, the piano driven tunes of the '70s on another, and a handful of the other tried and melodic journey-bound masters - Soelzer takes us on an enjoyable Gulf Coast ride as he searches his soul.","7200":"Thoughtful of my 14 year old to purchase this for my birthday, but the piano playing, which is 5\/6 of the album is completely soulless.\nBeware when an album lists no artists!!!!\nThere aren't any on this.","7201":"Great promise","7202":"Excellent music, great performance by both artists, such a good blend of cuban & flamenco style, they both are great","7203":"I heard about Bosley from the 98 Rock radio station in Baltimore.  They would occasionally bring him in studio and play some of his tracks.  The music is fantastic and I'm enjoying listening to the album.  I'll be on the lookout for new music!","7204":"I'm obsessed with this song. Great dancing track.","7205":"Save your money. The sound quality is awful. Unless you are a collector and want every possible version of Lohengrin, skip this. It's horrible.","7206":"Thirty years ago this was my first recording of Lohengrin and I was happy to listen to it again. Keilberth and the Bayreuth Festival orchestra are recorded in decent mono sound. The MP3 quality very listenable. I particularly enjoy the performances of Steber and Windgassen. Steber has a wonderful voice and I have promised myself to listen to more of her recordings. Lohengin was the perfect  role for Windgassen. The recording finds him singing lyrically with less dryness than would be later heard. It would be nice if the acts were indexed. This is an excellent performance at a very affordanble price.","7207":"Love his voice so stinkin much!","7208":"If you like instrumentals it's just fine.  That isn't what I was looking for.  The sample player doesn't work again (still) so I couldn't preview it.  I bought this one song to make sure so I lost a buck downloading a song that isn't in the format I want .....","7209":"Good Music!","7210":"I absolutely loved Coming to terms, and bought this one without a second thought based on the first album.  I was very wrong, this is so much more pop then rock and I will not even check out a 3rd album if there is one.","7211":"myron sharvan is another amazing Buffalo NY  icon who has broken through with this debut offering as the leader of world coyote project.myron has miles of nationally recorded band names in his back pocket where he was a studio ace guitar guest.he had a vision and went about the task of assembling some of todays greatest names who form world coyote.myron does things one way....\"THE RIGHT WAY\"....from his creative writing,and composing  to picking an all star cast of musicians who share his extraordinary creativity.he has an unusual but finely tuned idea of what he wants to play and record.his music opens the eyes and ears of his already huge local following and new fans that have jumped aboard the world coyote project train.he does this by not compartmentalizing this project into a specific genre.he has something for everybody here.staggering blues riffs,melodic instrumentals ,power guitar driven classic \"hit ya in the gut\" rock.he has mastered his own genre,as most of todays truly gifted artists are opting to do.the face of rock will continue to break off into new tangents daily,with the emphasis on delivering the goods you want and will keep.\nAs for the players ,i mentioned myron did not go halfway. HE'S ALL IN....he shares guitar duty with Phil Brown,the guy who has shared studio and stage with such names as little feat,and the latest Kool and the gang release.he has written for the likes of Cher,Kim Carnes,Kix,Bonnie Tyler,and Steve Perry to name a few. James Anderson holds down his half of the rhythm section as bassist. James has rocked with both Winters Brothers and their bands,Arc Angels,The Stratoblasters,and numerous other nationally recorded artists. Jimmy \"Z\" Zavala,has added spice to many quality artists works. Dave Stewart of The Eurythmics fame calls \"Z\" the greatest harmonica player in the world. That is an accomplished resume,but to add to his list he wasn't passed up by Rod Stewart,Bon Jovi,Tom Petty,Yes,and with his saxophone skills he adds zest to alot of our favorite artists music.\"Z\" has been named Etta James' \"hoochie coochie man\".Bruce Bowland fronts this amazing group of talent. Bruce founded and performed with the Blackbirds who featured a guitarist by the name of STEVIE RAY VAUGHN!\nAs for the music this is an intoxicating blend of finelyweaving golden laced amazement.\"Almost Home\" the title song is the killer on this writers review of the whole cd.it'll drive ya to tears,it is one of those songs that won't leave your mind once its gotten in. What is realized here is that it is possible to be powerful without pounding wattage down your throat,as is exemplified in \"SNAKE BITE\".The lead off song \"SHARE THE BLAME\" is another example. A well written song lyrically,a song for the thinking man,but what is so spellbinding is how myron phrases the guitar work on the intro. An old rock\/blues trick that gives you some insight into its soul,the lead break guitar solo. After this solo the power of the band blends beautifully to climax and finish your best girl off.myron is no show off guitar player ,he just plays with his heart and soul to give you absolute harmony laiden music.\"LONG SHOT\" is another well constructed piece of this beautifully created puzzle in which all the seamless soulful wonderment comes together to reveal the tapestry that is myron sharvans \"WORLD COYOTE PROJECT\"\nI wish i had the time to walk this cd door to door to blow some minds......buy it so you can enjoy it blowing yours.","7212":"insipid lyrics and hacked beats. Boo","7213":"Awesome album.  It radiates amazingness.  Its an album you can let play all the way through and they do a great job of mixing the styles and sounds to keep you on your toes.  \"That Thing\" and \"Two Different Worlds\" are by far my favorites even when every song brings something to the table and makes this album complete.  I was lucky enough to hear some of this before it was released and it hasn't come out of my CD player or off my phone since.  Going on 4 or 5 months now and its still great everytime.  I hope they don't stop here and keep on pumping out music of this quality.  Thanks AB!!","7214":"I like the original.  I was disappointed that I didn't double check to ensure that this wasn't the original singer.  I skip it whenever it comes on.","7215":"This is a very challenging test, but it is very enjoyable.

It's short, the vocals are completely overdone, and includes about ten seconds of applause at the end of it. What a waste of MP3 money.","7221":"This is one of my favorite CD's of all time. It shifts from Prog-Middle Earth folk-Jazz-back to Rock and gives the listener fantastic lyrics.

Haven't had since high school.  But this particular pen is turning out to be unreliable.  I'll be writing along on something, and the ink stops flowing at the nib. Nothing I do gets the ink flowing again. So I have to fall back to a more reliable ball point pen.  Yes, I know the price is rock bottom, but should that mean it is unlikely to work?  I may just send it back for a refund.  I want a fountain pen where I know I'll be able to finish what I'm writing.","7226":"just got this song and a few others,i love this song so much,Breaking Benjamin in general make great music,hopefully they make a new album in 2013 or 2014!","7227":"did not puchase this  product","7228":"What a fun, fast song to add to my workout playlist! Why doesn't Natalia get radio play? Love the theme and the bangin background beat of the song. Keeps me goin. I want more!","7229":"I listen to many genre's of music from all over the world. So when i heard a track off of this album, i knew i had to hear more. i found a couple songs on youtube, but as this album doesn't seem to be crazy popular, i found it here on amazon.

That is all","7253":"I really could not appreciate the samples, becuase there is not enough time in play to know whats going on in the track or what the track is all about. The sample are too short. As a DJ I have to decide whether I want to buy a track that is instrumental or vocal. One of the tracks I was not sure what the hell the track was about since it repeated the same intro over and over and when it got what ever the lyric may have been about the sample ended.","7254":"The perfect surf\/adventure movie. thank you for making me dream.","7255":"This is not the movie sound track, but very good.  Big fan of Glen, so I will have no negative comment.","7256":"a beautiful composition.  The lyrics and vocals will penetrate your soul.  I don't listen to a lot of Christian spiritual music as after playing it once or twice it gets old.  Not this one!","7257":"A John Ragsdale tune beautifully executed by Glen Campbell.  This piece of music, like so many that Mr. Campbell chose to do in his early years, I feel represent some of the best work that he did. This musician was always underrated, probably because he wasn't a writer or perhaps it was something else. But whatever the case, some really great and memorable music came out from the mid-sixties to the early seventies. I recommend that anyone who grew up with Glen Campbell's music get this and any other from that time frame as it will evoke many sweet memories.","7258":"excellent","7259":"Doesn't get better than this.  Download this song and take it with you...it will always remind you of summer!","7260":"I found this just browsing and was very surprised at this song which has some of Edvard Grieg's Hall of the Mountain King in it. It's not the type of music I usually listen to but I like unusual music and this fits the bill. It's now the first song on my mp3 player.","7261":"not my kind of music","7262":"Jason Gray is so awesome.  All his songs are from his heart.  I saw him in concert at a church with another performer and wished he had sang the whole night himself. It should be more like falling in love... doesn't that just say everything!","7263":"Not worth the price: this digital download was free!","7264":"I just recently discoverd Todd Lorenze, and I am impressed with his music combining samples of good story telling and a mix of old style blues mixed with a modern blues sound also. I recommend giving this a try.","7265":"Superb playing, flawed digitization ... I got this as a present and returned it for replacement by another copy. Both copies had encoding errors ... the recording was interrupted by ticking noises. I assume the original recording is flawless, but the digitization for sale by Amazon is flawed.","7266":"What a lovely and artful mix of tasteful acoustic guitar tracks!\nPlayed with sensitivity, movement, lightness and elegance.\nVery nice original-sounding music for the office and for creating a pleasant listening atmosphere for guests and visitors.","7267":"nice","7268":"OK","7269":"I do not own and did not purchase this product.","7270":"Relates so much to my own life, love the song and love PRC.  Love to use this song when giving my testimony.","7271":"Yes, these songs were all popular enough individually; throw in some Larnelle Harris, Steve Green, and Twila Paris, and you're all set for a lite-pop church service. Nothing wrong with that. But as a group these songs hardly represent the 80s, unless the CCM songs that \"defined a decade\" were all MOR ballads, plus one novelty track not really representative of Randy Stonehill's folk-rock center. I had many of those transparent cassette tapes pictured on the artwork, making mix tapes off of cassettes, CDs, and the occasional LP. I promise this collection does not resemble what CCM was all about in the Reagan years.\n\nIt's almost as if arena rock (Petra, DeGarmo and Key, White Heart, AD), New Wave (Mad at the World, Flock 14, Crumbacher, Farrell and Farrell, Bryan Duncan, Charlie Peacock, some Michael W. Smith, Steve Taylor, some Daniel Amos), hard rock\/metal (Rez Band, Stryper, Whitecross, Bloodgood, Shout), alt-rock (Altar Boys, The Choir, Adam Again, The Swoon, The Violet Burning), rap (DC Talk, and...um... The Raptures?), singer-songwriters (Keith Green, Billy Crockett, Mark Heard, Phil Keaggy, Michael Card, Amy Grant, Leslie Phillips, Billy Sprague, Margaret Becker), pop country (Kim Hill, Steven Curtis Chapman, Paul Overstreet, Morgan Cryar), R&B (Take 6, various Winans, Jon Gibson), and whatever you call Carman never happened. Who puts only ten songs on a compilation released in 2011 to cover music 20-30 years old? Quite the half-hearted cash-in effort on behalf of Word\/Curb\/Warner Brothers. I bet there's not even a retrospective essay by Brian Quincy Newcomb or John Fischer.","7272":", i love this, beautiful sounds for JESUS CHRIST I listen all the time to this kind of gospel  i love this mans music","7273":"This is elevator music! Misleading title. I want to delete it entire album. Disappointed! It is too good to be true. If it had lyrics I'd b satisfied.","7274":"I bought this MP3 because I rather liked the tune, but couldn't find any other information on it anywhere else.  Unfortunately, this isn't just the music, but contains the cheesy sound effects from the episode as well.  Rather disappointed in that, would not have bought it if the preview had included some of the sound effects.","7275":"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Very-Best-of-Pure-R-B-The-Summer-Collection\/dp\/B0000633G4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Very Best of Pure R&B: The Summer Collection<\/a>&nbsp;I was led here because I was looking at \"The Very Best of Pure R&B\" import CD and it had a link to where you can download the songs as mp3s. But this doesn't seem to be the same album.  Maybe you people over at Amazon can fix this.","7276":"Although Mozart's prolificacy was lifelong, 1784 was a special year for him. During this annus mirabilis, Mozart wrote no less than 6 piano concertos (all masterpieces, K.449 through K.459), the Quintet for Piano and Winds K.452 (in Mozart's own words, the greatest thing he had ever written), the great C Minor Piano Sonata (K.457) and the \"Hunt\" String Quartet in Bb (the fourth of the six \"Haydn\" Quartets). All of this in less than 12 months.\n\nDuring this remarkable year, the 9 weeks between 2\/9\/1784 and 4\/12\/1784 stand out, transcending mere fecundity:\n\nFebruary 9, 1784: Mozart completes the Eb Piano Concerto K.449\nMarch 15, 1784: Mozart completes the Bb Piano Concerto K.450\nMarch 22, 1784: Mozart completes the D Major Piano Concerto K.451\nMarch 30, 1784: Mozart completes the Quintet for Piano and Winds in Eb, K.452\nApril 12, 1784: Mozart completes the G Major Piano Concerto K.453\n\nThis is astonishing - some might even say miraculous - even for Mozart. In recent years many scholars and musicians - particularly of the HIP variety - have sought to demystify Mozart, to knock him down a peg or two. Musicologists have been keen to point out his flaws and seem obsessed with the prosaic details of his life and work, and HIP practitioners have endeavored to bring Mozart \"down to earth\" with roughed-up, sweaty, ugly sounding performances. The goal seems to be to endlessly remind us that Mozart a mere mortal. The Zeitgeist commands that we scoff at notions of divine inspiration. Mozart was nothing more, the musicologists tell us, than a very clever man.\n\nYet when we listen to the music we know better. And in spite of their ongoing efforts to mortalize Mozart, no musicologist has been able to sufficiently address the miracle of 1784. How did Mozart do it? How could any man create no less than 5 masterpieces in less than 9 weeks? It is one of the great mysteries of the universe, and one that no scholar, no matter how learned, will ever be able to answer - just as physicists will never be able to explain the deepest questions of existence.\n\nThis recording is a hidden gem of the catalogue. It pairs Walter Klien - one of the keenest Mozarteans who ever lived - with Stanislaw Skrowaczewski (SS) and the Minnesota Orchestra. Klien's way with this music is wonderfully idiomatic. His instrument of choice was a Bosendorfer Imperial, which allows for fortepiano-like transparancy without the hideous sonorities associated with period instruments. Klien is a master of legato - each note sparkles, but his touch is percussive enough to make Mozart's keyboard lines both sing and dance.\n\nAs a \"B\" label, Vox employed some scruffy regional ensembles - some not much more than pickup bands - to record the Mozart Concertos with Klien (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Mozart-Complete-Solo-Piano-Concertos-The-Voxbox-Edition\/dp\/B009T2XPC0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mozart: Complete Solo Piano Concertos (The Voxbox Edition)<\/a>&nbsp;In the 60's and 70's he was paired with the Mainzer Kammerorchester with Gunter Kehr (K.414, K.456, K.467), the Pro Musica Orchester Wien & Paul Angerer (k. 449), the Wiener Volksoperorchester with Peter Maag (K.451, K.488, K.491, K.537). In each of these recordings (none of which have been remastered to date) Klien shines, but the B-grade orchestras sound sour and rough. Whether that is more a function of poor engineering than the artistic shortcomings of the ensembles, we cannot know. Either way, it is a shame - considering Klien's immense talent - that these recordings sound as rough and harsh as they do.\n\nThankfully, we at least have this disc, the only Mozart Concerto performances featuring Klien in which the orchestra and sound engineering rise to the occasion. In K.453, SS leads the Minnesotans in spirited readings of the outer movements, and the Andante is full of such exquisite beauty and refinement that it qualifies as a \"postcard from Cythera\" (as reviewer BO'H would say!). Klien's playing of the Andante cadenza is deeply contemplative - and on his Bosendorfer, we get to luxuriate in those deep bass notes. SS's crisply articulated Rondo is a joy - both Klien and the ensemble impart a sparkling vitality to the Presto interlude at 5:20. This Presto interlude is one of Mozart's best surprises, and a archetypal example of what makes Mozart Mozart. Overall, there is an abundance of energy in play here, and happily, a lot of it is supplied by the Minnesotans.\n\nK.595 has long been a subject of debate. Today's musicologists sneer at the notion that Mozart intended it as a farewell; accordingly, the HIP movement usually deprives their readings of this concerto of any sense of valediction. While the musicologists may be right, the HIP practitioners are surely wrong to play K.595 prosaically.\n\nWhether Mozart realized it or not, the Bb Concerto he completed on January 14, 1791 is indeed his farewell to the genre. Alfred Einstein argued passionately that Mozart seemed to have a premonition about his fate; while we may never know if this is really true, the music itself tells us that Einstein may have been right after all.\n\nRight from the start, the cellos and basses underline the Allegro with a sense of gravity. The happy tunes that follow are thus tinged with sadness - the sun is shining, but for the last time - and this signals that Klien and the Minnesotans see K.595 as more than just another item in the Koechel catologue, its status as the final piano concerto being something more than mere coincidence.\n\nAny doubt one might have about the valedictory nature of this work is removed in the Larghetto - a vision of eternity - and Klien and the Minnesotans play it with a wistfulness that makes the heart ache. The Rondo, playful and childlike - a longing for the days of innocence - is sweet, charming, innocent, and sad. Arthur Hutchings wrote that \"the sun never sets on any of Mozart's four piano concertos in Bb\" - this is undoubtedly true, but in K.595, twilight is nigh.\n\nThis pairing is serendipitous. The sound is good, and the performances are brilliant. Marvel at the miracle of 1784. For 62 enchanted days, time let Mozart \"hail and climb \/ Golden in the heydays of his eyes...\"\n\n\"... And honoured among wagons I was prince of the apple towns\nAnd once below a time I lordly had the trees and leaves\nTrail with daisies and barley\nDown the rivers of the windfall light.\"\n\n-D. Thomas","7277":"Lovely song, but someone gets really weird with an electric guitar in the back ground before the first chorus. Discordant. Made my nephew cry. Not at all what I purchased that for.","7278":"This is a great version of this song from a great movie. This is my favorite cover song on the album.","7279":"Simply great music from you c418","7280":"This song makes me.smile","7281":"Gotta love the creative but simple chord progressions (I mean, how often do you hear major seven chords in pop music?), the fantastic melody, and the inspiring lyrics. I'm glad Weezer and Hayley didn't change much about this song, because it was perfect as is. They certainly did it justice.","7282":"This was selected as the entry song for a class of Headstart students' graduation ceremony.  The children loved it, but some parents had doubts about possible double entendre. Decision was made to use it. The technology worked well, the sounds was great, and the ceremony went well.","7283":"I love the Muppets and hate to write this review.\nBut I bought this CD for myself and one for a gift.  Wehn I got to work, wishing to play mine, I found it did not work!!  It wouldn't play.\nOh well, things happen.\nExchanged it that night and tried again today.  This one doesn't work either.  I tried 3 players!  No luck.\nAnd worse, the person who got it as a gift...well, she's having the same problem.\nDid I get unlucky enough to get the only 3 that don't play?  I doubt it.\nPoor quality run.\nSave your money.","7284":"It's too bad some so-called singers had to insist on covering these great songs; they were much better in the original and some things are so good the first time, no one should go adding their own two cents worth to that for their own personal profit and 'fame'.  This is definitely no improvement or enhancement of the muppets original show recordings; leave well enough alone!","7285":"This is an album of classic Muppet songs covered by modern artists.  It includes favorites like \"Rainbow Connection\" and \"Movin' Right Along\" from THE MUPPET MOVIE (1979), but my favorite track, hands-down, is Matt Nathanson's \"I Hope That Something Better Comes Along\".\n\nOther highlights include \"I'm Going To Go Back There Someday\" by Rachael Yamagata, \"Bein' Green\" by Andrew Bird, \"Our World\" by My Morning Jacket, and Sondre Lerche's fun \"Mr. Bassman\".\n\nOK Go perform the \"Muppet Show Theme\" in their off-kilter style.  Weezer and Paramore's Hayley Williams put an alternative\/punk spin on the uplifting \"Rainbow Connection\".  \"Mahna Mahna\" is pretty much a straight cover of the Muppet original, with very little interpretation by The Fray.\n\nThe more I listen to this album, the more I warm up to it.  I love the Muppets and am familiar with most of these songs.  Most of the covers stay true to the original Muppet versions and make for enjoyable listening (though I found \"Night Life\" by Brandon Saller of Atreyu and Billy Martin of Good Charlotte to be too heavy for this collection).  This tribute album hits its highs with the various ballads, in my opinion.  The final three tracks are an excellent block of music to close out the album.\n\n\"I Hope That Something Better Comes Along\" was a comical lovesick ditty sung in THE MUPPET MOVIE by Kermit and Rowlf.  Nathanson sings it softly with piano accompaniment.  It's such a beautiful tune, you forget he's singing about dogs and frogs.\n\nI think any Muppet enthusiast should give this tribute album a try.  At least listen to the MP3 samples.  There are some fan-favorite songs and some interesting interpretations.  And the interesting mix of contemporary artists might allow listeners to get acquainted with acts they hadn't really heard before.","7286":"This isn't the Muppet show theme song from the show. It doesn't even seen like an attempted cover of the theme song.","7287":"Had this on Vinyl about 20+ years ago & was a great song! Phil himself or Atlantic ought to release it in some type of compilation package , or put it on a greatest hits ...  Great B-side wasted","7288":"Only a few good songs on this cd .

I was surprised I paid so low for this item & still use it.","7291":"This is a very bland, homogenized dance CD. There really is nothing special or innovative about any tracks. I tried listening to it as a whole and as separate tracks, nothing memorable either way. The production is OK, but all sounds are the same intensity, nothing stands out. Buy a deadmau5 CD instead, you will get more from it.","7292":"I bought this CD after hearing the first track, \"Sing My Sister Down\".  Unfortunately, much of the remainder of the CD is very lightweight and fails to rise to the level of the first track.","7293":"She sings with the voice of Angels","7294":"If you own a majority of the Yello albums up to now, particularly the remaster albums, Touch and Essential Yello (Special Edition) you own all but 4 of these songs - not a version of them, but the exact version of them.  All of these songs are the shortest, album versions.\n\nWhat I was hoping for was an anthology of all of those hard to find singles and B-sides that are now going for astronomical prices.  Dieter, Boris, how about it?  I skipped buying this compilation, but would step up for a box of all of your past singles in their complete glory. Particularly those gems like \"She's Got A Gun\", \"Lost Again\" and others that contain songs or versions of songs that have never been released on CD.  Let's do it!","7295":"This is the manic ramblings and sonic nonsense of the late Wulf Zendik.  Zendik Inc. and much of their 'art' is so bad, so unpolished and malformed, as to be found under the rubric of 'dada'.  Avoid these people and their tripe at all costs.","7296":"My man Dom Pachino is maad nice, and son's skills have only increased since Killarmy's first joint 'Silent Weapons'. (If you hear Dom on 'Silent Weapons' and listen to him on later albums and projects, you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.) I've also been really impressed by Pachino's newer solo joints (go and copp that 'Unreleased' joint) on his Napalm Recordings imprint, which is nice because now fans get to hear Pachino spit 100% rather than passing the mic to his compadres. Hands down, Dom Pachino is one of my favorite emcees, PERIOD.\n\nHowever, I heard this and was heavily disappointed and let down. If you listen to all of his solo projects since the last Killarmy album, PR sounds like he's pumped full of vigorous energy, spittin venomous darts all around the tracks. This one '4 Security Reasons' sounds lazy, tired, boring, lethargic, monotonous, uninspired, and overall a below average performance from the PRT.\n\nWhoever was enlisted for production provided some really tired samples that were sloppily chopped up. On top of that, the beats are all under about 120 bpm except for a fast song (track 3, \"Gunz Out\")with some sloppy drum programming. Even Dom's darts are terribly boring as are those from the lesser known Wu-affiliates (like Crunch Lo from Cappadonn'a group Othorized F.A.M.), which is one reason why so much of the extended Wu fam is unknown: most of them aren't worth listening to. I hope this 'Security' project is not a downward spiral into the descent of wackness for Dom. Only time will tell.\n\nBut if you want some hot Dom ish, check out 'Unreleased', 'Domination' (which is really hard to find), or almost anything under his Napalm recording label.","7297":"I would give it no stars if I could.

Now when I go into my Cloud it says this album is there?  I clicked on it to find out what it is, it wants me to pay for it to be downloaded when I already have! Please Amazon fix this!  I hope nobody else has had this problem.","7304":"The reason I say it's fair is because the volume of the\nsongs were not nearly as relaxing as they should have\nbeen for sleeping; that's what I use this type of music\nfor, because it kept getting really loud and then so\nsoft I couldn't hear it .","7305":"Pear  Extemp'ore PSCD 2011\nRELEASE DATE 5\/24\/2011\n\nRick Milne - Percussion\n\nNick Pierone - Keyboards\n\nEvery fiber of my being tells me that I should really hate this release...I rarely listen to others so why should I pay much attention to myself. I would be wrong.\n\nPushing musical boundaries all while innovative, evocative and with an incredible sonic depth of field. The debut from Pear opens the musical senses but asks you to do but one thing.\n\nListen.\n\nThe amount of time, thought and creative energy put into this release must be mind boggling. A musical frame of reference would be later more experimental Miles Davis meets Brian Eno. Welcome to the land of rhythm and groove.\n\nImprovisation. Being in the musical moment is the celebration that is \"Extempore.\" One special guest that gives a phenomenal performance is bassist Jennifer Leitham. This is truly a release that will give up something new of itself with each spin of the disc. \"Subtle nuances\" prevail whether the Miles Davis sampled spoken word intro to \"Dewey Miles\" or the rapper Cindy Wonderful this may be the finest example of a free jazz recording session to date.\n\nCreativity abounds, avant garde but accessible; a sonic color pallet for the mind","7306":"Only one star because amazon download version is low rez 222k mp3.

The sound has nothing to do with Oceans as in waves etc. I'm quite sure there are many who would play it that would like it and understand it.","7331":"Not worth the price: this digital download was free!","7332":"I don't remember buying this","7333":"Thanks","7334":"Melissa Gorga is better off raising her children and leaving the music world alone. She is a pretty girl but not photogenic. She can't sing. She can't dance. Her emotions appear to be flat in this song. Making different versions of a bad song doesn't make it any better. Think of all the good she could do in the world with the money she is putting into her talentless self.","7335":"If wishes were horses, beggars would ride. This song made me want to break my iPod. I feel bad for her kids who had to listen to her 'sing' this over and over again. It's heavily synthesized and the only bearable thing is the beat. My husband is an audio engineer, and he was so shocked when he heard this song. The vocals are very amateur and the singer has no range or depth. Needs singing lessons for like 5 years before she should release another song. Don't buy this tripe, save your money for some real music. Even if you are a die-hard Gorga fan, stop the madness! At least with Tardy for the Party it was a catchy tune. This is just total garbage. I wouldn't listen to this again even if you paid me to do so!","7336":"I love finding new music.  After hearing this person sing, I want my hearing back!  I hope she has a real job. Awful tone and tune.","7337":"If this song were selling for a nickel it would be too much money. Unbelievably mundane....really sucks! not worth buying.  She's just a tabloid TV wannabeewho  thinks she's hot.  She auto invest in a hair transplant.","7338":"This is the first Hawthorne Heights album that I can't even LISTEN to. They veered so far off of their path that I think they might not be able to find it again. Change is good in a band, but THIS much change is too much, except for the first and MAYBE second album after losing a member (either to death or just leaving the band).\n\nThis honestly just kind of sucks.","7339":"I may be over a year late with this review, but I believe someone needs to share just how excellent this album is--especially for psych-rock aficionados--so better late than never. While Tim Cohen's other band, The Fresh & Onlys, are a little more well-known, I believe his work under the name Magic Trick is more timeless. Whereas the former specialize in up-tempo, 60s-ish (now 80s-ish) jangle psych, and to great effect, Magic Trick's music here is truly original, and almost defies categorization.\n\n'The Glad Birth of Love' contains elements of folk, old-school blues, Indian music, Syd Barrett-style psych, and prog, resulting in a sound that not only is unique, but when combined with the surrealistic, soul-stirring lyrics and heartfelt vocals, is very moving as well, and makes for an extremely absorbing listening experience. The four songs here average over 10 minutes apiece, making this album perfect for late-night headphone journeys. Throughout, you'll hear reverb-soaked acoustic finger-picking, gorgeous boy-girl harmonies, hypnotic drones, and stellar dream-like melodies, with a hazy atmospheric sheen over everything that gives these songs an eerie, mystical sound that seems way off in the distance while tickling your brain at the same time.\n\nIf you're a fan of The Fresh & Onlys, do yourself a favor and give this a shot, even though it is entirely different. But there's no denying just-plain great-songwriting. The closest comparison I could make would be the rootsy post-rock of early 2000's Califone mixed with the dreamy folk-pop of Skygreen Leopards, but weirder and more progressive. It'd probably be easiest, though, to just check out the free stream at Bandcamp and decide for yourself. If you're anything like me, it most likely won't be coming out of your rotation for a very long time.","7340":"Why doesn't he have his own Wikipedia page? His use of recurring tonal motifs is rad. I also like how the 30 album tracks are organized in alphabetical order and it somehow flows really well.","7341":"Everyone needs a song like this in his\/her music library. Craig Hella Johnson composes magnificent works, like \"Requiem\" (brings me to tears every time), and \"Motherless Child\" is no exception. Beautiful-- can't stop listening!","7342":"Very fun version of this song.","7343":"Obviously, Nancy cannot release any new recordings since her untimely death, but these two \"new\" collections are recycled from previously released CDs. If you are a Nancy -phile as i am, you can save your money since you already own these recordings. However they would make excellent gifts for newcomers to Nancy.","7344":"Wonderful song!","7345":"Yeezy and Jay are like batman and robin...except both of them are Batman","7346":"The truth is that the review is of one star is a star too many. Trying to rebrand cow dung by calling it cow patties just is an attempt to hide the truth. It is still cow dung. That is how I feel about this song, artist, and the whole wannabe album. This song is horrible, the beat is okay, but the vocals are ghastly. There is no depth or range. It's a waste of time and money both on the consumers' end and on the part of everyone subjected to this. The only happy person is probably the audio engineer  that mixed this because he is laughing all the way to the bank for the hours he has logged in the studio trying to make this tripe radio worthy. The truth...is that this totally sucks.","7347":"Please...stop the madness! This song is horrible. So auto tuned it's ridiculous. If I wanted to hear a computer signing, I would use Garage Band. Its the same repetitive Lines over and over again. No range, no depth, no talent. Save your cents or spend it on someone with the actual ability to sing.","7348":"The only thing that should be on display here is a refund ticket for any money you spent on this garbage. Seems we live in a society where bored housewives are so desperate for attention and fame, they will humiliate themselves to no end just to get attention. The mere fact that someone gave this girl a recording contract tells you the depth of how low this society is going. Any idiot off the street can now be a tv star wannabe or singer. The days of real talent are gone folks, welcome to the decline of society.","7349":"This sounds like a robot is singing it.. This isn't music.. Auto tunes at its worst. I would not waste .89 for this.. It's garbage","7350":"I would not waste the 89 cents for this song.  It is over processed electronically and horrible.  What company would want to bankroll this.  This is worse than Countess Luann's song.","7351":"It must be a joke on the music buying public to actually charge for this so-called music.  This chick couldn't sing her way out of a kid's birthday party.  Nothing but over-processed, heavily synthesized, trite, electronica garbage.  While the cream still rises to the top with modern home recording technology, the downside is that we have to wade through a sea of human waste to get to it.  Melissa Gorga is a no talent hack who needs her troll of a husband's money to bankroll this mess because NO ONE ELSE WILL.  Ridiculous.","7352":"This is not the best of Disney. In fact it doesn't sound like Disney music at all. Just because it is the song from Pinocchio doesn't mean you can make it into jazz up version and still call it Disney. If you want the version from the movie, go to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Disney-Classics\/dp\/B00G9Y6U3W\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Disney Classics<\/a>","7353":"I was expecting the movie sound track.","7354":"I like the beat to this song, and I think it's funny. So, I got the \"cleaner\" version. However, this is an absolute radio cut with commercials and talking towards the end of the song. I ended up deleting it from my account because why would a pay for a song that was obviously taken from a free radio broadcast? Not a fan.","7355":"Awesome!  Love me some Unknown Lyric!","7356":"It is so politically incorrect.  Hurray!!","7357":"Dope but not the version that I was looking for.","7358":"Ugh. If half star was an option, that is what this deserves. It's not catchy, it's asinine...kinda like audio cyanide. Not being a hater, but this song is horrible. The person that gave it 5 stars must be deaf. Stone deaf. No talent whatsoever. No range, can't hold a note for more than a second. No lung capacity. No depth. Very choppy, which means she couldn't sing the whole thing all the way through. Every single song on this album is horrible. The songwriter that wrote this probably wishes they had never given Gorga this song to sing. They probably wish they had given it to anyone else...perhaps even her cousin. If anyone else had sung it, this song would have had more traction and be 10x better. This is terribly sung, and i want a refund. she probably sounds great in the shower...but don't we all? That doesn't mean you need to be \"On Display\"","7359":"Laid back","7360":"Perfection in every way possible.","7361":"One of the best!","7362":"This Camouflage Nylon Pouch w\/belt loop for Zippo,  First off my belt was too wide for the loop so a narrow belt is needed. Secondly, the Zippo fit so tightly into the pouch, well, it was hard to remove the lighter. It did stretch out over time and all went well. Like i said, a narrow belt and your aces.","7363":"Ok. So I thought his first CD was one of the greatest. It still is, but this one is even better. More R&B style but one you can definitely sing a long with.","7364":"Im giving this a four because i haven't heard the whole album. But these are the songs i loved - definately worth hearing:\n\n1. Maybe = This is a beautiful song. Its a love song for this generation about a guy who likes this girl and he isn't sure if she feels the same and he sits around waiting for her to text him\/sign on etc. Its reaaally sweet, the music is beautiful, the words aren't typical what you hear in love songs and jay sean sounds the best hes ever sounded. Its got a little guitar solo that everyone will love towards the end\n\n2. Stay = The lyrics in this song and the chorus are fantastic. I love how he drags on the word \"stay\" in the chorus. Its about a guy and his girl who always argue and basically he says he knows he treats her bad but he wants her to stay. The remix of this is hot as well.\n\n3. Tonight = This song kinda reminds me of Neyo \"Closer\" but its also its own thing. Jay sings about a girl who catches his eye at the club and hes saying he aint lettin her go home tonight.. its a hot track\n\n4. Ride it = I didn't like this song at first but it grows on you.. listen to it a few times its a pretty nice song.\n\nThats all ive heard but i think it would be worth getting the album. Jay sean has talent we've seen that from his last album. Check out the songs ive listed, im sure you'll love it.\n\nMurder is an awesome song as well. It features a girl name Thara who sings it well with Jay. And Used to Love her is pretty good too.","7365":"SSLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW\n\nannoyingly so.  I can't stand it compared to his old stuff remixed with awesome punjabi beats.  These songs are whiny and very late tween love.  yuck!  I'm disappointed I bought the CD at all.","7366":"Unfortunately it took much time to send it . So it stayed on the hotel reception.","7367":"One of the most emotionally touching songs, ruined by a techno beat. All of the emotional strength was lost. Buying this was a mistake.","7368":"The bass line is wonderful.  Such a great and danceable track.","7369":"The pianist only showed how great he is with improvising that does not match with the original theme of the song. It does not make good music if you just keep adding licks without understanding how they go with the song.","7370":"I gave it five because it deserves five. ENIGMA is an amazing group. All of their music is great and I will be collecting all of their stuff.","7371":"This is a great song - the video is very cool as well (stop motion). Highly recommend this song and his other works as well.","7372":"ok","7373":"Someone recommend this song to me, after I heard it at the very first time, I am attached to the song.","7374":"The music is great but the title of the piece is actually  Widor's Toccata..  I think it is the MP3 album problem since another music service has the same problem..","7375":"Thought I bought a clean version of this song but it isnt........","7376":"Not the real Boris Godunov","7377":"Ok oldies","7378":"Great music its really heavy and the singers voice is just creepy, but what really gets you is the atmosphere.\n\nall n all great\n\nRecommend to anyone","7379":"These two \"new\" collections are just that. Collections from previously released CDs. If you are a Nancy -phile as i am, you can save your money since you already own these recordings. However they would make excellent gifts for newcomers to Nancy.","7380":"Nancy Harrow is not a household name.  She should be.  Fantastic voice in jazz.  She had impeccable taste, an easy manner, great timing, beautiful intonation.  Nothing is forced, she had a natural rightness about her. Just amazing.  I think she was as good the best ever including Billie, Sassy, Anita, or Ella.  Really that good.","7381":"If you are a Michigan Wolverine fan, this is a must.  This song friggin rocks!!\n\nGo Blue!  Hail to the Victors!!","7382":"I expected the entire song and only got about 30 seconds worth. The singing for the 30 or so seconds is great but it was disappointing to say the least.","7383":"The sample is more music than lyrics not a very good selling point. A little longer sample would have been better so we can hear Sarah's beautiful voice.","7384":"Ok I'm prejudiced. This guy is really cute. But the song is a bouncy, peppy tune that will make you wanna dance or get in some aerobics. I use it to keep moving when I feel like taking a pass.","7385":"This is a wonderful modern prayer song (psalm). I was impacted by the message, and the modern rock was very well done and energetic. One of the best new bands I have ever heard, in the last 10 years. I have shared this track (Change My Life) with a lot of people.","7386":"So nice to have a masculine openly gay singer and it helps he is attractive and a good singer.","7387":"I was introduced to Matt's music when someone sent me the 'WTF' video and kinda dismissed him as a generic 'gay' artist, i.e. high energy songs. This album is actually very different to that preconception. It's proper, adult pop music, almost MOR in parts, but works well. The highpoint is the title track where Matt's amazing voice carries you through every emotion of the song.\nThis is great, well sung, well produced music and Mr. Zarley deserves all the success coming his way.","7388":"Great song","7389":"Man, laying down those troubles can be tough, for me at least. \"No, it's all good, I got this Lord\" is a phrase that flows all too often from my stubborn self. \"In the end I'm realizing, I was never meant to fight on my own!\" Amen to that. Now I just need to work on not having to re-realize it so often ;-)","7390":"Good Stuff. :-)","7391":"I have been looking for this CD for a few years now and finally found it! It came new in the package as promised and arrived quickly.","7392":"I huc ccact is a little longer one to vent their frustrations","7393":"My son wanted this song so I clicked on this from the video. It is not the version that was on the radio and in the video. It sounds different like it is a different person singing it. If you want the original sound get the one that does not say Demo. I had to go back on buy the regular one.","7394":"Her music is always excellent... I really enjoyed it.","7395":"Not what I thought it was","7396":"One of my favorite songs.","7397":"Great song!","7398":"There is no question that Nicole Scherzinger from The Pussycat Dolls fame has had some ups and down away from being a Pussy Cat. One of them was last year as winner of Dancing With The Stars. But musically, she hasn't really shown that she could sing more than she could chew. Her latest song Don't Hold Your Breath isn't really a song that feels exciting or well-displayed. She doesn't do enough to show that she can fully be seperated from her pussycat dolls days, and be taken more assertively as a solo act in the ways others' like Beyonce' have thrived. Nicole really needs to get something out to make it more of a \"wow factor.\" She said she will have something out soon, but honestly what she has shown is more of a snoozefest that makes it worth holding your breath.\n\nSong: D+","7399":"WOW!  Thrilled that I finally discovered this great singer\/songwriter.  In addition to a seriously individualistic approach to all songs, even oldies, she has written two excellent books.  Wish I'd known about her decades ago.","7400":"Psychostick Rules! (I know thats not their song,  but its a sub-band of their band basically, but not legally)","7401":"We kind of stumbled on Juliet Piper and from the second I heard this song, I haven't been able to get it out of my head!  It's delightful!","7402":"I downloaded this mp3 expecting a recording of \"nature\" sounds only, but was chagrined to find that there is an orchestral track over the bird calls and general forest sounds. On top of this, the quality of the orchestral recording and the quality of the \"nature sounds\" differs greatly.","7403":"I would recommend this cd to anyone who was starting out to listen to real southern gospel music! Great buy too!","7404":"This disc is very interesting the music being different from the norm. Makyo has written a collection of songs that are to my ears very pleasing. I will be listening to this disc many times in the months to come. If you like to play music that cannot be placed under a specific heading but is still melodic this is the disc to buy.","7405":"I thought I was getting the Audio CD version of the book.  This is a collection of songs and not the book.  Disappointed.  I saw her on TV and enjoyed what she said and wanted the audio book to listen to in the car.","7406":"was not like the one i was looking for.","7407":"Any version of this song I will download because it hit me in HS school and never stopped touching me deeply. The George Benson version I heard around prom time. I also love Oleta Adams' version. All versions will be played at my Celebrancy service when my life on this earth is over. Then the ceremony will be over. It will be played in the Fall only, my favorite season. Get the connection?","7408":"If you like funky jazz, once you listen to this CD you will be hooked!!  Awesome  :-)","7409":"this collection of songs by Mocean Worker appears to be their best. Many previous albums have some exciting work as well, but it is rare when when just about the entire album has a robust and eclectic body of work. It really gets your day moving.","7410":"If You like Stoner\/Doom Rock I love this CD from Elder  Dead Roots Stiring","7411":"Great condition, still love Jack!!!!!!","7412":"DotMatic's track \"Moving On\" is a really great Soul Beat and a great production. I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys good music.","7413":"love this group","7414":"Purchased by an ex-friend who figured out how to hack my account 4+ years ago.","7415":"This is a fun Island song of Madonna!  It call The Island Beautiful or aka The Beautiful Island.  I love the fun beat, too!","7416":"ok","7417":"I absolutely loved this song when I heard him play it live and in the video when he plays this song with his guitar, but I don't care for this version of the song.  I am really disappointed that I'm not able to find the guitar version to download and listen to.","7418":"its a clip of a song.","7419":"The Way of Peace is a New Thought book written by James Allen. Although Allen is more widely known for his As a Man Thinketh, it is the lesser known The Way of Peace (1907) which reflects more accurately his New Thought Movement affiliations, referencing as it does Christianity, Buddhism and Hinduism. The book is essentially a treatise on the importance of meditation as a 'pathway to divinity'. Whatever we meditate upon, Allen explains, we become. If you meditate upon ' that which is selfish and debasing, you will ultimately become selfish and debased'. Whereas if you meditate upon ' that which is pure and unselfish you will surely become pure and unselfish'. It is now in the public domain within the United States and most other countries. It has been released as a Project Gutenberg eText edition. The book consists of 7 chapters: The Power Of Meditation; The Two Masters, Self And Truth; The Acquirement of Spiritual Power; The Realisation of Selfless Love; Entering into the Infinite; Saints, Sages, And Saviors, The Law Of Service; and The Realisation of Perfect Peace. The first chapter also contains a poem, Star of Wisdom, which captures the essence of the book.","7420":"Slash's tone is awesome!\n\nThe Slash-man's heyday was 20 years ago with Axl Rose \/ Guns N' Roses. His post-GN'R output has been somewhat disappointing, but this song delivers!\n\nSlash's tone is killer, his guitar is way up in front of the mix (read: loud), his chunky riffs are killer, and his leads \/ solos are truly inspired.\n\nYes, this is a kids song, but for 99 - it's a worthwhile addition to your collection.\n\nSlash is a great session player. My other favorite Slash track from the last 10 years is his work on Daughtry's \"What I Want.\" It also has that sleazy guitar tone that made Slash a legend.\n\nWhere's Perry?","7421":"More like Tom Petty meets your typical flavor of the day post 90s poppy commercial rock. Looking at the guys on the cover you would swear they just got done playing a biker bar, but the tunes are radio aimed all the way. There are a few decent riffs here and there for certain, but the problem is that they all fall flat on their face as they just plain try too hard to be catchy. You gotta groove hard and strong IMO and these tunes just DON'T. The sad thing here is that the vocals and guitar are of an obvious very high caliber. One of two things happened with American Bang. Either (a), they were led around by a nose ring via a lame producer that was over concerned with \"hooks\", or (b)as a group they put all their eggs in the commercial radio basket. Either way, it's weak and typical commercial rock. BTW, what the heck are people comparing this to classic Stones or Skynyrd for??? There is NOTHING here even remotely close. That much is hype to be sure.","7422":"Lame is the best way for me to describe this cd.  The tunes are along the lines of something I would expect to here on any commercial fm \"alternative \" radio station.  Vocal heavy and downright boring this band really brings nothing new to the table.  Unless you like pop heavy music or like to be able to hum along with every song, then run, don't walk from this cd.  I have the feeling this is an \"either you love it or you hate it cd.\"  I hated it.","7423":"I have been reading all the reviews from this band and I Am not sure if my copy was from some kind of mistake recorded with another band material.\nThis band is so far away from true solid rock that I do not need too much time to explain why.\nThey only have one song, the opening one \"Whiskey Walk\" that you can call serious Solid Rock, the rest of the album is commercial, soft, fluffy or whatever other superficial adjective or word, phrase for naming an atribute.\nThey have nothing in common to Lynyrd Skynyrd or Guns N' Roses, there is no Southern Rock in their music, if you want to get a new Southern Rock band check Dirty Sweet, or if you want some Guns N' Roses style check New Device but please be honest, you can like this band or not but do not compare it to any Classic Rock Band!","7424":"Killer buy, worth every penny.  Comes with a huge dj mix that's almost worthy of buying just on its own.  Great tech house and some soulful stuff thrown in.  Not minimalistic, but still good.","7425":"was bummed","7426":"This is 1 of the best & hardest West Coast albums ever! The beats slump & the lyrics r filthy as hell!","7427":"Its not the real thing!  Some things can be copied, AC\/DC can't ! Wasted my $. Why is there not the real songs and group? Very disappointed","7428":"Not the version I was looking for","7429":"timeless classic!!!","7430":"I don't remember this song, so it probably sucks.","7431":"Nice song.","7432":"nice selection of late 60's songs","7433":"Some thirteen years ago, I was knocked out by the vocal expertise of this young, fedora-clad gentleman when I heard him sing with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra (NYJO) during a trip to London.  On this 2009 album, on which he performs lesser-known standards to the accompaniment of a superb jazz trio (along with tenor sax, fluegelhorn, and cello soloists), Atila has matured into a first-rate song stylist, influenced primarily by the late Mel Torme, with whom he shares a velvety voice and impeccable musicality.  For me, the CD's dual apices are two classics associated with Frank Sinatra which deserve far greater recognition:  \"You, My Love\" and \"Nancy (With the Laughing Face)\", both composed by Sinatra's lifelong pal Jimmy Van Heusen (Mack Gordon supplied the lyrics for \"You, My Love\", while comic Phil Silvers, who was an early Sinatra sidekick, penned the words to \"Nancy\", which was dedicated \"The Voice's\" then-baby daughter) and interpreted most sensitively by Atila.  He rounds out the recording with selections from Richard Rodgers (in collaborations with both Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II, whose lyrics adorn the title track), George and Ira Gershwin, Italy's Riz Ortolani, Johnny Mandel, and Brazil's Dori Caymmi, applying his vocal gloss across the board.  Atila is a most welcome addition to the pantheon of male vocal giants.","7434":"I received my CD within a few days of purchase and it was just as described. I would definitely recommend purchasing from here.","7435":"I loved this CD, and it was well worth the price (Hey, I've never seen it cheaper) But in my opinion, it was missing something, perhaps if the company had added somemore songs? Anyways, WELL WORTH THE MONEY! I listen to it over and over (Bugs everyone ^_^) So, if your a hard-core digi-fan, get it.","7436":"'Wow' is all I can say about some of this amazing artist's songs! Very original, artistic, and written so well. The lyrics are great, the music is amazing, and his voice is the best I've ever heard. This song, Favorite Disease, is one of my favorites of the more tame songs from TFK. A must-have for every TFK fan, if you ask me!","7437":"This song is very unique, and everyone may not like this type of song...I don't know. I do; especially given that fact that Thousand Foot Krutch made and sings it.\n\nIt is about drug addicts, I do believe. The singer is saying that \"every time I hear you say I just need one, to take this pain away\/\nyou're a broken wing, not a broken thing, you can heal in time, if you try, it'll be okay, you can walk away, sweet Juliana...\" and that he wishes he can take the pain away, to make it all seem safe.\n\nIn the bridge, he says: \"and I won't laugh, I won't look, I won't listen if you just get up\/ and I won't laugh, I won't\nlook, I won't listen if you just stand...\" and I like that, because that is exactly what people who need to stop something (from a bad habit to drugs or whatever) need to hear, that somebody cares and won't laugh at them trying, won't laugh if they fail again.\n\nWhich can be used as either God saying that, or a loved one, either works, I think. Or if the person listening to the song has no one, then it's the singer telling them.\n\nIt's really a beautiful song. I recommend it 110%.","7438":"Sounded great!","7439":"Old time wedding song clean and fun","7440":"this is not the whole song just 15 secs of intro needs to removed from amazon listing as a song.","7441":"Thank you Sharon Isbin and Stanley Jordan","7442":"great!","7443":"Soothing to the spirit.  Great to unwind with after hectic day.  Good for the soul.  Uplifting and inspirational. Guitar done well.","7444":"I purchased this CD for relaxation in my home spa. It started skipping by the second song and skipped the entire CD. I took it out and looked at it and sure enough there was a HUGE scratch on the back which is probably why it would not play right. Unfortunately I threw away the packing slip and cannot return it. Hopefully the seller will see this and send me a new one without the scratches! Not holding my breath...\n\nDisappointed:(","7445":"A truly beautiful piece of music.","7446":"If you are a Deion fan, \"Must be the Money\" should get you high stepping to the end zone.","7447":"From a small studio, to large professional studios, this album sounds great.\n\nA group of professionals and powerful vocals take the cake","7448":"This song, while having lyrics that are really profound in telling a melancholy story, is still very fun to listen to and sing along with. I have the impression that the \"princess\" of the song is a character struggling with transgenderism. Keeps me thinking. This remix is quite nice -- not really \"better\" than the original, nor worse. Just different, and lovely in its own way.","7449":"Pros:\n- Nothing\n\nCons:\n- Sloppy playing by the Philharmonia Orchestra;  late and early entrances one after another and muddy sonics ruin the performance. It seems like Michael Tilson Thomas was in a big rush and had very little time to rehearse the piece.\n\nAdditional comments: Somehow I expected more from Michael Tilsom Thomas and the Philharmonia Orchestra; they really don't offer anything new to the table. For outstanding performances, look for Fritz Reiner's 1960 recording of the excerpts with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Antal Dorati's recording with the Concertgebouworkest, and Gergiev's recording with the Kirov Orchestra (now the Mariinsky Theater Symphony Orchestra). But keep in mind that Reiner's reading is approached as symphonic concert, so expect quick an quirky tempos. On the other hand, Dorati's reading is a lot more sterile and steady. All in all, Reiner and Dorati's readings are performed with such precision it makes Tilson Thomas's recording sound like a High School Band. It's a pity, because Tilson Thomas has some magnificent recordings out there (Beethoven's Late Choral Works with the London Symphony Orchestra), but this just isn't one of them.\n\nIf you're looking for a more recent recording, I strongly suggest Sir Simon Rattle's recording with the Berlin Philharmonic. All in all, avoid Tilson Thomas's recording, there's just way more and better competition out there by better orchestras.","7450":"Awesome!!  Better than I imagined.","7451":"This is a great album. It is unlike anything else you're likely to hear, in a good way. Upbeat, light-hearted and free, it is 60's-style swinging rock with high, distinct vocals. And the song titles are hilarious. These songs combine western rock with what I assume is traditional Cambodian sounds, and they do it beautifully. It is so sad that this entire generation of talented musicians was murdered during the Khmer Rouge.\n\nListening to this album makes me wonder what Cambodia was like before the Khmer Rouge; it's sort of a glimpse into a lost culture. But beyond all that, it's good music and we're lucky that it survived. Thanks for all the effort that went into making it available online.","7452":"Who would ever want only one movement of an entire piano concerto in poor sound???\n\nWhere's the place to order the entire piano concerto, as the composer wrote it?","7453":"Don't waste your money","7454":"I thought for sure this would be the exact song from the soundtrack but I cannot tell. Maybe I didn't read correctly but this version seems a lot more boring and blah. Not even what it sounds like in the movie, the movie version is incredibly good!","7455":"\"Your Last Smile\" is the debut album from Iranian composer\/pianist Behdad Bahrami, and what an incredible debut it is! The twelve original piano solos are tinged with melancholy and blend classical, new age, and pop elements into a soulful, meaningful listening experience that gives a glimpse into the soul of a very passionate and poetic young man. It is also a reminder of what a powerful and universal language music is and that although we might not understand each other's words, speaking from the heart with music will always be understood.\n\n\"Your Last Smile\" begins with \"The Light On the Balcony,\" a piece that conveys warm contentment with an easy grace and gentle touch. \"Secret Whispers\" is gorgeous. A bit more classical in style, the haunting and slowly flowing melody creates a pensive, dreamy mood. \"Voice of the Rain\" is one of my favorites. It occurs to me that if Chopin were alive today, he might compose something like this. I also really love \"Cold Steps,\" a dark, very introspective piece that comes from deep within, expressing a profound sadness that takes your breath away. \"Melody of Autumn\" is much lighter and has a  swirling energy. \"Nobody Knows\" is a lovely ballad that seems to be telling a story - perhaps a shared secret. \"The Last Smile of You\" conveys the feeling of tragic loss. Mournfully sad yet elegant and graceful, this is another favorite. \"The Cafe at 25 O'Clock\" is quite different from the other tracks, with jazz chords and playful keyboard runs that show another side of this gifted artist. \"End of a Dream\" ends the album with a light-hearted waltz that dances around the piano with its charming melody and then ends abruptly at just the right moment.\n\nBehdad Bahrami is a really impressive new artist who just might be on the brink of an international music career. Highly recommended!","7456":"My sole regret is not being present at Washington's Blues Alley when they laid (lain?) these tracks down on a cold January night in 2010.  What an absolute delight of swinging, inventive and nourishing big-band music this is!\n\nWhile each cut is of interest, I'll single out \"Not on the Bus\", written by MSG Matt Niess, a tour-de-force mini-suite that name-checks both Nat and Miles and generates palpable suspense and excitement with some transitioning flat-5ths before settling down in a nice modal groove.  Excellent!\n\nThen there's \"Barbara\", Horace Silver's waltz by way of \"My Favorite Things\".  Arranger MSG Jim Roberts, the band's guitarist, betrays an impressive harmonic palette as he investigates the full measure of the tune.  This guy can write!  Sopranoist SSG Antonio Orta, takes a nice, evocative solo along the way.\n\nToo many other treasures here to mention. My gosh, the attending audience must have had a wonderful evening of music that night!\n\nBy the way, the full album is available for download at http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/US_Army_Blues\/Live_At_Blues_Alley\/","7457":"Sekiranaun Graffiti is amazing, but the remixes leave something to be desired.","7458":"Need it be said? Miku is the best singer ever, and she proves it even more with this song. 5 stars to this.","7459":"It was the first time hearing it on here and I knew I wanted it. It is a great song that I would give it another rating of ten out of ten. A Great song.","7460":"good song","7461":"One song?","7462":"Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Can you tell i think its great!","7463":"The intro they created for the live opening of this song rules. Pumps me up every time I hear it","7464":"We recently had our lambing barn restored.  When I put together a video of the work, I wanted something that sounded like the ewes and their babies were there in the barn.  This was perfect!","7465":"As a longtime Tub Ring fan, it pains me to give them a bad review, but the only thing that kept me from giving this a 1 star is my love of the band and the 4 songs that I think are listenable on it: #03 Cg Vs. Tr - I Shot Your Faggot Horse Bitch (Old School Mix), #04 Here Come Da Fuzz, #07 Goldfinger (Funkfinger Mix), and #11 Here Is Come Is Da Fuzz Dizzle - S8 Rob Kleiner Remix.\n\nThe rest of the album is basically just bad noise remixes.  Even on a song like #13 The Day the World Will End (Private Apocalypse Mix F. Aesop Rock)mindcuffed that I wanted to enjoy if only for Aesop Rock, he's so low in the mix you can barely make any of it out.\n\nHowever, what I can recommend are the previous albums by Tub Ring, namely 'Secret Handshakes' and 'Fermi Paradox'.  Basically, anything 'Drake Equation' and forward is amazing.","7466":"Tub Ring's Secret Handshakes album (easily their best) spawned this remix album.  So here's a bunch of tunes that aren't quite as cool as their original interpretations... but the point in owning this album - when you're all out of Tub Ring... this record keeps the party going!","7467":"This is a really beautiful album.  Ms. Vaughn has a lovely voice and her songs are well written and catchy.  I just wish I could hear stuff like this on the radio!  :D","7468":"The meaning of the words are profoundly true about our God and this worship tracks are beautiful.\nHighly recommend!","7469":"This song was a a # 1 in that era. Everyone knew the words, and everyone danced when it played.","7470":"Vassily Primakov (born 1979 in Moscow, Russia) is an award-winning Russian concert pianist and recording artist known for his interpretations of Chopin.\n\nPrimakov began studies at Moscow's Central Special Music School at age eleven as a pupil of Vera Gornostayeva. He then attended the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara and the Juilliard School in New York, where he studied under Jerome Lowenthal.\n\nIn 1999 Primakov won second prize at the Cleveland International Piano Competition, and in 2001 he was a semi-finalist in the Van Cliburn Competition. Upon hearing Primakov's performance of \"La Valse\" at the competition, Van Cliburn himself said \"Prodigious technique, really wonderful,\" with a \"look of sheer rapture on his face.\" Primakov then won both the Silver Medal and Audience Prize at the 2002 Gina Bachauer International Piano Competition. In 2007 he was honored by the Classical Recording Foundation with their Young Artist of the Year Award. His disc of 21 Mazurkas by Chopin was named a \"Best of Year\" by National Public Radio (2009). In 2011, along with his duo partner Natalia Lavrova, Mr. Primakov launched a new Record Label LP Classics.","7471":"Enjoy this.","7472":"Excellence","7473":"I bought the version of this album that also includes the DVD video shot during the Winter Music Conference in Miami Beach. The Music compilation is awesome and the video is very entertaining! Includes club scenes, South Beach street scenes, and a good review of events during the WMC. I have reservations for WMC 2010. Buy this album!","7474":"Music Today clearly has no idea how to pick a handful of exceptional performances. The performances here seem like a random sampling of Hindustani vocal music. Even I could do a better job.","7475":"Singer-songwriter Polache got his start with a rousing anthem urging Hondurans to take pride in their nation, Polache is the stage name of 32-year-old Paul Hughes. The moniker combines his first name with the Spanish pronunciation of the initial letter of his last name.\n\nBorn to an English father and a Honduran mother, Polache began playing guitar when he was 9. But he didn't think he could make a living as a musician so, after university, he took a job with an ad agency in the northern city of San Pedro Sula, Corts.\n\nThere, Polache was chosen to compose the music for an ad campaign promoting Honduras and the result, \"Mira a Honduras\" or \"Look at Honduras,\" became a surprise hit. In the song, Polache points out that besides political corruption, gang wars and poverty, Honduras is home to great natural beauty and honest, hardworking people.\n\n\"This is a country with low self-esteem,\" Polache said. \"I wanted to write a song that said: Even if we have thousands of problems, we have many good things that need to be recognized.\"\n\nThe success of \"Mira a Honduras\" led to a television program in which Polache traveled the backroads, strumming his guitar and singing with the locals -- like an old-fashioned troubadour.\n\n[...]\n\nPolache grew up listening to U.S. and British pop music. But he later came to believe that too many Honduran tastes -- from fast food to popular music -- were imported. \"My music tries to promote all that's catracho,\" he said, using a slang term for Honduran.\n\nFor many years he chased that dream playing with one of the nation's biggest teams : Motagua. Failing to obtain success he called it a day and decided to start a career in the advertisement industry. He created numerous jingles for commercial products. His breakthrough as an artist came while working on a Honduran Tourism campaign, which needed a song to go along with the advertisement. Polache submitted \"Mira a Honduras\". The song was selected.  At first his name was not mentioned, but people got interested and started asking questions about the unidentified artist. From then on his career flourished.  Polache went on to have his own tv show \"De Troba con Polache\", in which he visited various places in Honduras.\n\nAt some point Polache got financial help from an artist support program created by the couped president Manuel Zelaya. When the coup happened in June 2009, Polache was one of the few Honduran artists to strongly oppose. He called himself apolitical but said he was a friend of president Zelaya.\n\nPolache's music has been a great success thanks to the things he sings about : from everyday social problems to one of Honduras' main passions : football. He tends to write his songs in a very special way, using as much Honduran words and expressions as possible.","7476":"Be warned: The reader omits phrases even from the famous beginning.","7477":"Being a big fan of the third wave ska scene, Public Service was a staple of the Philly\/New York ska show circuit.  If you desire a blast from third wave ska past, pick up this album.","7478":"ok","7479":"I just want to know how I can record a song and have Amazon feature it because I know for a fact that my voice is probably just as awful as this guy's yet I've never had the nerve to share it publicly. What were you guys thinking? Again, really????","7480":"I love singer-songwriters, and this guy's body of work may be much better than this, but this song is wretched.","7481":"This is an early April Fool's Day joke, right? This is one of - if not the - worst pieces of crap I've ever heard. Amazon, you should be ashamed. If you are going to offer up this garbage - even for free - you should come up with a rating system that includes negative stars (although 5 negative stars would be too kind). One would have to be a real masochist to download this nonsense. C'mon guys why not pull this from your catalog and spare others the auditory pain of even previewing it.","7482":"I can understand why this was previously unreleased. This has got to be one of the worst attempts at music I have ever heard!","7483":"Solemn, lo-fi, acoustic strummed, bummer of a song.  The mood of this song just does not match that it is Labor Day Weekend.  It is ironic in that the singer beckons you to go out and frolic in the sun and sea (because they won't make you cry) but his attitude leaves you to believe that he will just go out and flop on the ground sobbing while he achieves a severe sunburn.  Some singer\/song-writers' best work really only shines when someone else performs it and that could be the case here.\n\nOn a side note:  This review is for this one song.  It bears no reflection on the artist's past body of work.  If David Gilmour had a FSotD and I didn't like it I would give it a low rating.  That low rating would have zero indication on how much I love a good bit of Pink Floyd.","7484":"I really like this song and wanted a version without the audience laughing in the background. The laughter is louder than the singers sometimes and prevents me from properly enjoying the recording. Please have a version without the background noise!","7485":"This is a very well made album and the songs are amazing. I'm a fan of electronica and its refreshing to listen to an artist in the genre who doesn't sound like Skrillex or any of that crap. I'd say its part electronica and part rock but I can for sure tell that Joke is inspired by rock music. This is an outstanding album and I listen to it on a daily basis.","7486":"I hear this song \"Reaching Land\" over streaming Shoutcast radio and I think its an amazing song. The song has a lot of feeling and is very thought provoking.","7487":"Totally Patrick O'Hearn.  If you like his older music, you'll love this CD.","7488":"Thank you Patrick for what you see, hear and do.\nYou truly help us get through !","7489":"Oh my GOD!! I love guided imagery mediation and hypnosis tapes. This one is one of the most beautiful ones I have ever heard. Her voice alone is hypnotic, I could feel her sweet energy right through the I pod.  It took me to other worlds. I swear my body lifted off the floor, which freaked me out. I  love this tape, it is so well done. Thank you for making it. My new favorite!","7490":"So soothing and calming. Perfect for ambient music, background music and relaxing. The entire song is soft and flowing. -","7491":"I first heard of Nobot through Pandora's intuitive suggestive programming while selecting my favorite electronic music.  Love the heavy vocoded\/auto-tuned voice used in a lullaby fashion.  This CD has ethereal tones that helped me through many of grueling work shifts.  This is good music to relax ones mind and go on a head adventure.  Very fun!\n\nGive a listen they are a good band,  interested in learning their history.","7492":"ANNA is wonderful, always. Used the song for graduation!","7493":"good item,good seller","7494":"There may be a more ardent fan of Jimi, but I haven't met one. I spent the whole of my adolescence aquiring the vinyl,( exotic Japanese imports to the last run pressings on vinyl with just more integrity than a six-pack holder. The copy I grew up with, and spent an exorbitant amount of money on,was a beautiful Polydor import from Japan. This track, which I purchased without preview, was not what I heard on the original vinyl. I assumed that since the cover art was identical, that the music would follow. I love all that is Jimi, but this isn't what I wanted.","7495":"this little wing is not the Little Wing from the album In The West.\n  you should give me my money back","7496":"If you love some rockin pipe organ music, this piece is for you!\nIt's not the well-known toccata like the Easter-time-favorite from Widor, but this lesser known one is equally fantastic!  In my opinion this one has more drama.  And may I add that my mother plays it brilliantly.  But since she does not have a CD on amazon.com, you need to buy this recording from Felix Hell.\n\nI sampled several different recordings of this toccata on amazon.com.\nAnd this is the one you need.\nThe others are too slow or lacking energy.\n\nMy only critique here is that the echo in this hall makes it hard to appreciate some of the faster passages in the piece.  But the energy is still there, and I recommend this recording!\n\nOh, and I'm still waiting for this guy to make a CD called \"Felix Plays the Hell Out of The Gloucester Cathedral Organ\".  Heehee.","7497":"This song is so awesome. If you haven't seen the video on youtube with Vanilla Ice, do check it out. It makes the song even better somehow.","7498":"This took a very long time to be delivered. It is printed in Germany and took 2 1\/2 months to be deliverd. There was a page that had been missed at printing and the replacement page was loose in the book. Would never buy from this publisher again","7499":"Great music. Doesn't work on Windows Movie Maker.

Waste of money.","7500":"Great, clean song for children to dance to!","7501":":)","7502":"nice song","7503":"The CD's are of poor quality, there are skips in the play back and the sound quality is muffled and poor.","7504":"The alter-ego of Hevisaurus; Sauruxet is actually the same band, except with a different singer. This band was the result of a contractual disagreement between Hevisaurus and their record company, so the group went off and reformed under a different name and singer. Sauusplaneetta is the only album that Sauruxet ever released. The band apparently worked things out with their record company and returned to their old lineup and name.\n\nThe music is fairly similar to Hevisaurus, light-hearted Power Metal and Classic Metal sung in Finnish. The production is excellent and the musicianship (as expected) is also very good. Riffi Raffi has some excellent shredding leads and riffs throughout the cd. The songs actually sound more serious and more standard Metal than the Hevisaurus stuff that I have heard (which is goofier). Then again, I don't speak Finnish so I don't know how silly the lyrics are, they sound more serious than Hevisaurus though, lol!\n\nAnyway, if you are a fan of Hevisaurus or just Scandinavian power metal in general, I highly recommend it! The download is also pretty cheap, though I foresee buying the hardcopy someday. ;-)","7505":"This album is not the same band as in the description. Its some other band with the same name.

Definitely a must have to your Gospel workout playlist!","7514":"The skeptic in me says that Jimmy Candle got the credit for a single track because CHV Music Factory wanted the summary line to show \"Various Artists\" rather than \"The Blue Rubatos\". In reality, I have no idea why.\n\nWhen there are still good collections of original hits, when it's really easy to buy any single song you remember, why would you pay for a bunch of cover songs by these folks? I don't know why, and to keep this album from showing up so high on the \"Avg. Customer Review\" list, I'm giving it this 1-star review as a caution to others.","7515":"Book of Revelations by the Drums is an extremely good first track off of a phenomenal album.\nIf you're into Indie, this is a prime example; I like the weird way they structure their songs (theres not really any firm chords in any of their music, which by the way makes it extremely hard to play this music acoustically), along with the synth. I wouldn't really consider it electronic music at all, but it does have some elements from it. The lyrics are really rather good and catchy as well.\nThis track, Money, and Please Don't Leave are all terrific tracks if you want to sample their music first.","7516":"This is a quite neat song and I always wanted to have it! Thank god that Amazon has it :D\nJust...BUY IT!","7517":"First of all, I find @ Wikipedia two composers named Leo Smit.  One is this one, an American born in Philadelphia.  The other was a Dutch composer who, in 1943, became a victim of the Holocaust.  The poems by Emily Dickinson are wonderful, the songs less so, though the singing is exceptional and the composer is a superb pianist.  I am just not that fond of the music.  But you shoud buy this CD even if its just for the wonderful, delightful, charming, funny short essay Smit has written on the course of his life and the people he met, and a little something on what each of them contributed to what he became.  Just a sample, from the end of this essay, which goes about 3 lines past one full page: \"...Leonard Bernstein, who set a high  jump record while conducting the climax of my Second Symphony; Mary Goodwin and her friends from the Taos pueblo--singing, dancing, and drumming under the New Mexican night sky filled with infinity of cold, clear stars; and Emily Dickinson, who has been running my life for the past ten years and inspiring me to write songs to eighty-three of her stupendous poems.\"  Along the way, he has unfailingly funny takes on Dmitri Kabalevsky, Isabella Vengerova , Nicolas Nabakov, George Balanchine, Igor Stravinsky, Bela Bartok, British astronomer Fred Hoyle, and many others, not to mention the Chinese laundry over which his family lived at the beginning of his rich and productive life.","7518":"Cool music.  Good beat. I really like this song, that's why I downloaded it.  I copied it to the music folder on my Galaxy S5.","7519":"Great vocals but I didn't care for the arrangement.

I use these types of songs for a candle light vigil, and Amazon does NOT allow me to preview the entire song before purchase - they only provide a 30 second snippet of it.  As I feared, only two of the songs on this CD were appropriate, and the others were too fast, too loud, or too \"dramatic\" for use at my vigil  So, overall, I wasted my money.  C'mon, Amazon, please allow your music customers to review the ENTIRE song before purchase.  Had I known they wouldn't work, I would happily have purchase music that was more appropriate for my needs.","7525":"I agree that this is not the original recording of 1968 that another customer wrote. The song is too slow compared to the original and the break should have a farfisa type organ solo not a piano.

Harry Flowers, of course, was a character in the notorious 1968 Nicolas Roeg film, Performance, a strange, cruel little movie that's credited for signaling the end of the `60s alongside Altamont, the Manson Family murders, the demise of The Beatles and the inexplicable triumph of The Archies' \"Sugar Sugar\". Rum times indeed.\n\nThe irony is that \"Wyvern & Worm\" is doing its best to preserve many of the sounds of `60s, it's gentle psychedelic jangle will remind many of groups such as The Zombies and Traffic, right through to the more traditionalist recordings of XTC and Robyn Hitchcock. Fortunately, Flowers songs are ageless, impossible to truly pin down, and rather than wallow in clich, he writes songs that timelessly evoke an England, which hasn't altogether disappeared, but is certainly becoming harder to find. He then envelops them in soaring harmony and perfect pop arrangements.\n\n\"Wyvern & Worm\" won't bring Flowers international stardom and untold wealth, but it does mark the arrival of an artist eager to come to terms with new surroundings, new traditions and enduring music. The best material here happily stands alongside the classic recordings that have obviously influenced him. \"Pastoral Fantastic\" takes on early, baggy Blur and wins with a paisley flourish. \"Sad Light\" brings his antipodean roots to bear, and the Finn brothers are filtered through hazy sunshine psychedelia. \"Dawn Chorus\" greets the new day with Northern brass and a cheery disposition, and best of all, \"White Horse\", six minutes of mellow, intense narrative, accompanied by graceful strum and the impression of old Albion restored.","7565":"If you haven't bought this yet buy it now. Excellent band. Original sound. Not nearly appreciated as they should be.","7566":"It goes without saying that Fanny were the premier female rock group of their time and I'd argue that their concise instrumental prowess and fresh intelligent songwriting put them a notch ahead of the average group of either gender. Why their rich musical legacy has been criminally unrecognised is incomprehensible to me but that might change if June and Jean Millington's 'Play like a Girl' gets heard as it harks back to Fanny at their best and shows where they are right now.\n\nThe title track is guarenteed to get the dead rise out of their graves and dance as it is played at an infectious energy level and is June Millington's opening feminist exhortation that you can do what you damn well want. I love Your Hair sharply references back to a previous era as a sixties woman in both senses of the term with lightning fast sharp observations. Jean's fine vocals and funk bass playing comes to the fore in let Love Linger with acid guitar lines. The softer side of the Millington sisters show up in  June's tender love song \"When You Bottom\" and the melodic \"Calling Your Name (To The Stars) I must pay tribute to Jean's son, Lee Madeloni as his fine drumming and percussion lends an incisive edge to the ensemble sound that is always there when needed. Jean's bass playing and singing makes a rock solid support as she always has done. The very worthy women musicians of the Institute of the Musical Arts get an airing in this project in \"One for Change,\" a great stomping rocker with gritty harmonisied chorus vocals and the contrasting modern R and B lead vocal stylings of Endless Lies, a syncopated rocker with lyrics that go way beyond what might appear an exhortation to a faithless lover to straighten up. June's prowess as electric slide guitar from way back of Terrible Things reaches further into the awesome 'Train's a coming' Son House country blues of 'Fall on You' with contrasting light dancing vocals.\n\nThis is the album where youthful enthusiasm and age and experience hold hands and this feels so like a review of Fanny's \"Fanny Hill\" album it is unbelievable and I urge those best able to see them in concert.","7567":"To say that June and Jean Millington are a vital, albeit grossly overlooked, part of rock & roll history is a major understatement. As the co-founders of Fanny, the pioneering (and still, to this day, best!) all-female band, they, along with Suzi Quatro, set the stage for every other female rocker to come along over the next four decades.\n Over the years the duo have continued to work together, be it on June's three solo albums, as a duo (1978's LADIES ON THE STAGE and TICKET TO WONDERFUL from 1993) and with a new band, the Slammin' Babes (2000's MELTING POT).\n Now, more than a decade after the rather hit-and-miss MELTING POT, the sisters Millington return with PLAY LIKE A GIRL, arguably their best album since MOTHERS PRIDE, June's 1973 swan song with Fanny. While the disc isn't perfect (the production is a tad thin in spots, Jean Milington is woefully underused, students at June's Institute for the Musical Arts are used too much), it's pretty darn close. THIS is the album that many Fanny-atics have been waiting for!\n (On a side note, it's so cool to see so many women in their 60's still rockin' hard. Besides the Millington's, Quatro, Stevie Nicks and Deborah Harry ~ with Blondie~ have all released incredably strong albums this year, certainly among some of 2011's best).\n PLAY LIKE A GIRL kicks off with it's blistering title track. Full of garage-band energy and youthful swagger, this auto biographical tale is like \"Charity Ball\" all grown up! The sisters still have those killer harmonies that only siblings seem to be blessed with, while the instrumentation is taut and lively.\n In a just world, this would be a huge radio hit, but there are a couple of things that will prevent that from happening. First, there are the lyrics...songs about fishes surfing up stream just aren't in demand. Then there's the production ~ there are holes here that you could drive a semi through. By going for more of a live feel, June Millington and co-producer Lee Madeloni (Jean's exceptionally talented son) have kept things pretty bare-boned. By adding some keyboards, a little more percussion and some additional backing vocals, the track would have been much more fleshed out, resulting in a great cut vs. just a very good one. Still, one of my favorite tracks off the disc!\n Ditto \"I Love Your Hair!\" June Millington has rarely sung with such authority, attitude or animalistic passion. Growling the lyrics, she lets us know that she's been here since \"before the Gap\/before Madonna\/before rap\", and in that time, she's picked up a thing or two, resulting in a person she's happy with, both inside and out. Mark my word, this one IS ready to be a hit at urban, pop and A\/C radio. Brilliant! (Special mention has to be made of Jean's amazing bass riffs...they anchor the song perfectly!).\n \"Let Love Linger\" has both it's pros and cons. On the up side, it features Jean's only (co) lead vocal. Still supple and sultry, her voice dances over the first verse's lyrics, caressing them in a velvety embrace. Why this woman doesn't take more leads ~ or do a solo album, for God's sake! ~ is beyond me!\n On the down side, the song just goes on waaaay too long. Since moving beyond Fanny, the Millington's have frequently had a tendency to get a bit 'jammy', resulting in tracks that could have ~ and should have! ~ been edited down. This is one such track. Still,very nice.\n \"When You Bottom\" is sheer pop perfection. With it's lilting arrangement, spirited lead vocal courtesy of June and the girl group backing vocals, this track is plain old fun, from start to finish.\n \"Apocalypse Deferred\" has a dark, prophetic quality to it that really works....I just wish that they had taken it further. The arrangement is urgent and edgy, while June's lead vocal is honest and knowing, but the young girl chorus just seems calculated and contrived. I would have much rather seen something chilly, strong and steely from Jean, along the lines of her bridge on \"Woman Who Sees The Signs\" from June's excellent 1983 solo album RUNNING.\n Throughout her career, June Millington has written some amazing ballads, including \"You've Got A Home\" from Fanny's 1972 masterpiece FANNY HILL and LADIES ON THE STAGE's \"Fantasy.\" We can now add \"Calling Your Name (To The Stars)\" to that list. With it's atmospheric arrangement, delicate instrumentation and lovely lead vocal, this song is simply stunning. Nothing more need be said.\n \"Terrible Things\" has a wonderful bluesy vibe to it. Both tense AND relaxed, taut AND loose, June's guitar just talks to us here, even moreso than her lyrics. Yet another gem.\n \"Fall On You\" is a solid album cut, with a minimal, yet strong, arangement (once again, June's guitar just shines!) and a wise, soulful lead vocal.\n \"All For One\" is sweet enough, but we've heard June do a variant of this song on pretty much every album since '78. Nice....but necessary? I'm not sure.\n \"One For Change\" could have been a great rocker, but it's ultimately sunk by a number of miscalculations. First off, we once again have the production...this sounds like a demo tape. Second, the chorus...really amateurish and sloppy. Finally, the track just goes on WAY too long, repeating itself over and over. Yep, the seeds were there....they just never took root.\n And then there's \"Endless Lies'...I have a real issue with this cut. I'm all for June's work with IMA, but there's a time and a place for it, and it's not here. . I'm paying for a June and Jean Millington album, not a class project for Summer camp 2010. I WANT June and Jean Millington, especially when Jean Millington is already almost nowhere to be found (If we're being really honest here, why even call this a June and Jean Millington album? To cash in even more on the Fanny connection? Let's face it...this is basically a June Millington solo album). On top of all that, the lyrics are just dreadful...straight out of Intro to Poetry 101, or, even worse, some tweener's journal. A MAJOR misstep.\n Wrapping things up is the funky \"Opportunity Knocks.\" I wish June had taken the time to build on this gem with another verse or a bridge ~ this is another good song that could have been fantastic.\n In summing things up, I just want to say how much I love both June and Jean Millington (and have for 40 years now!) and PLAY LIKE A GIRL, warts and all. Both the sisters and this album are vitally important to music, and I, for one, can't wait to see what comes next! I just hope A) it doesn't take another ten years, and B) Jean can be convinced to pick up a pen and step up to the mike a bit more! Until then...play on, ladies....play on! (As with all my reviews, I'm docking the disc half a star for not including the lyrics).","7568":"love the song but u cant get the song back when u get a new phone or if your phone got 2 b reflash so u got 2 pay 4 it again","7569":"I'm not saying she has no talent, but halfway through her set the Bar Mitzvah boy's dad stopped the music and announced that the party was over, his son isn't Jewish after all, and everyone please leave their gifts and go home","7570":"GAH! UUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK! BLEEEECCCCCH!!!\n\nNot good, not good, not good!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nRap is so awful in the first place, but to subject children to it through learning is atrocious!

I would never purchase anything like this.\n\nLet children be children & let them listen to REAL children's music, not noise pollution passed off under the pretense of being educational. I'm only 30, so my children are younger. I like musicians like Tom Chapin.

When you have children that grow up listening to garbage music & television (ie: Nicki Minaj, \"Family Guy\" & the like), it programs their brains (television PROGRAMS) & creates chaos & confusion.\nI don't think adults should listen to or watch that raunchy filth in the first place, but hey... the entertainment business banks on feeble minded people who wish to mindlessly numb themselves rather than enrich their lives.\n THEN people wonder why their child is a heathen, does poorly in school due to anger & frustration (frequencies), dresses like a thug or a street walker & won't listen to them. Temper tantrums are just uncontrolled & unguided bouts of anger. Most people anymore don't care to correct (PARENT), but temporarily mask it with a \"reward\", like junk food, electronics or letting them run wild because they don't want to deal with them. I call it Wal-Mart Kid Syndrome. That child then grows up to be a hedonistic, uneducated jerk of an adult with an undeserving air of entitlement & narcissism because it was never corrected.\n\nIn test after test of academic abilities, American students score last in comparison with students from the other twenty or so advanced countries.

I listened to it for about :20. It sounds like I am stuck at the DMV or something.","7572":"Although the sound of this CD is not good (in fact, it is awful) what surprises me the most is the quality of the CD itself. Labels like \"Seeco\", \"West Side\" and many others are nowadays using CD-R to sell their products, which I consider a way of cheating the customer. CD-R like those produced by these labels I can find in my country at a very low price (let's say U.S.$1,0)and they are known as \"Pirate records\". Very sad this situation with these unconscious CD producers.","7573":"YEA,THEY TRY THAT,S ALL.","7574":"No matter what you get from Mary Mary is good for the soul. Make sure you listen to the words they are saying...","7575":"I can't fault Amazon for my failure to read the description, which clearly indicates that this track is 0:26 -- twenty-six seconds -- long. Twenty-six seconds, but full price (ninety-nine cents), the same price as any recording of normal duration. I paid ninety-nine cents for essentially nothing. Doh!","7576":"These album is very inspirational. My favs are I Wanna Know and He's Greater....\nI luv all of the songs on this almum. Everyone should get it, very uplifting.","7577":"It's a beautiful song, too bad they picked the wrong person to do the solo part.  This needs a crystal clear and strong voice, breathy just doesn't get it.  Also, unless you can nail it, don't try to do fancy runs.  There is something beautiful about pure melody and pure harmony.  It's why I choose acapella music, after all.  It's just sad as this was one of the reasons I purchased this album.  Oh well - there are other songs that work well.","7578":"More liberal lunacy from Calfornia.\nOscar Grant should have been home taking care of his child, instead of causing trouble on a BART train New Years Day.","7579":"Best Carlene out of so many thanks to Dave Edmunds and crew and she is STILL rocking right now.  this one got me hooked. fan since 1979 this record. and she is my neighbor in california. Keep on singing, writing and rocking awesome rich great sound with brits backing her cant miss!","7580":"Outstanding music cd by a great singer.","7581":"Not too long since the release of Fantasynth and it's slightly more upbeat rhythms and fantasy themes, we're now treated with this work which delves into the more mysterious and legends based on celtic mythology, a theme very prevalent in gothic ethereal realms. It seems we're able to pick up where we left off with Mythomusic or The Garden with the dreamy mystical sounds on this album. The delicate layers of ambient music are presented across well over an hour in this fantasy world and eleven tracks for a nice full body of work.\n\nThe album starts off with a rich and dreamy mixture of ambient textures in \"Forest Heartbeat\" and also with the follow-up piece \"True Spirit of Nature\" for over fourteen minutes of beautiful, lush dreamscapes. At this point we're launched into a little more up-beat chill-out style with \"Samhain Ecstasy\" and even more of a harsher tone with some grinding guitars (still in a new age style) on \"Sancta Inquisitio\". This uptempo rhythm carries on somewhat further into \"Druids Trance\", appropriately named for it's trance-like rhythms and electronic loops. At this point we get to a definite favorite of mine in \"My Beloved Loneliness\", with a little more of a classical style with more organic sounding instruments taking the forefront over the interwoven tapestries of the melancholy backdrop. \"Ritual of Love\" follows in similar light with a little bit more of a ritual sound as the name implies with some percussion and various hypnotic rhythms and loops. \"Earth Prayer\" is another excellent ambient ethereal piece with angelic vocals gliding over the entrancing music as we drift along into the upbeat trance-like piece \"Beltane Moon\". The soaring synths and moving, but very New Age rhythms and beats move us into another sweet, dreamy track \"Bewitched by the Faeries\". This eight minute track drifts along slowly and hypnotically, setting the stage for eight-minute finale \"Wisdom of Trees\". Ambient, whispering tendrils gently carress the listener in this soft, dreamy piece with it's subtle, layered soundscapes providing a backdrop for a siren song, luring the listener in and holding them entranced and trapped for the duration as the album slowly and softly drifts to a close.\n\nOver all the album is firmly rooted in the New Age style, something I've mentioned before we don't normally feature and review here on Gothic Paradise. However, there is just enough of the lush, ethereal and darker, dreamier ambient styles that take the listener into a beautiful dream-like fantasyland that has always caught my attention. As you listen to our ethereal radio show and a Psicodreamics track comes on, it just fits well within the hauntingly beautiful ambient realm, even with the touch of chill-out New Age styles. This album fits right in that mold as we drift from one piece to another, through the ebbing and flowing of the lush layers from smooth ambient synths to a little more pronounced styles and more upbeat rhythms. For fans of the softer ethereal and ambient soundscapes, this album is a great addition to any collection.\n\nRating: 4.5\/5\n\nGothic Paradise - [...]","7582":"NOT that inspiring.  the affirmations are weak\n\nIf you like the DVD \" The Secret,\" and Esther Hicks , \"Ask and it is Given\" (WHICH IS ABOUT ATTRACTING ABUNDANCE) ....You will find this MP3 a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.\n\nA MUCH BETTER MP3 ABOUT ATTRACTING ABUNDANCE IS:\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Wealth-Abundance-Hypnosis\/dp\/B004VQAQHG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wealth & Abundance Hypnosis<\/a>\nby Leslie Riopel, \"Wealth & Abundance Hypnosis\"\n\nThis is More About Attracting Abundance.","7583":"wonderful music really enjoy the Singing and music","7584":"One of the best bands in the west!","7585":"I downloaded it to my IPod along with other music I listen to while I sleep.

And also donating proceeds to the relief process.\n\nLike other recent AKB48 CD singles, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" has been released in 5 versions.  A regular and limited Type A, Type B editions (limited editions come with an event ticket) and the theater edition (which includes the first two tracks that come with the other two TYPE's, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" and \"Kimi no Senaka\" but comes with second C\/w song by Team 4 and KISS titled \"Tsubomitachi\" and no DVD).  Also, Type A and Type B will have different c\/w songs.\n\nAnd once again, in a time where CD sales are lower than ever in Japan, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" became the fifth million selling CD single for the group and going to show that AKB48s popularity is the real deal!\n\nThe version I will be reviewing is the regular edition Type-B featuring Mayu Watanabe, Yuki Kashiwagi and Minama Takahashi on the cover and the songs featured in the Type-B edition are \"Kaze wa Futeiru\", \"Kimi no Senaka\", \"Gondola Lift\".  The limited edition Type B comes with a random photo (there are a total of 18 available) and comes with a serial number to access a site for voting a song to be performed at AKB48s Request Hour Setlist Best 100 2012 concert and a promotional for their 2012 box calendar.\n\nAs for the CD single, \"Kaze wa Futeiru\" is a positive song of how people in despair, should have hope, should search for the light. Also, a song about rebuilding for the future and for one to continue living. How love and hope will continue and that the wind will continue to blow into the future.\n\nMy first time listening to the song and I was instantly hooked.  The melody was captivating and I loved the harmony among the various members performing the song.  But the positive message of hope is what I enjoyed most about this song.\n\nThe second song \"Kimi no Senaka\" (which translates to \"Back to you\") is performed by the Undergirls (these are the members of the group who were ranked #22-#30 in the AKB48 senbatsu elections, who get to perform the c\/w song).  The song is upbeat and continues the AKB48 happy, upbeat idol style.  While the song is catchy and a fun song to listen to, the lyrics are actually quite sad as it revolves around loving someone but that person not noticing you.  And one yearning to be noticed.\n\nThe third track is \"Gondola Lift\" and is performed by Undergirls Yurigumi.  For this single, the Undergirls was split into three groups with Baragumi performing \"Vamos\", while Yurigumi performed \"Gondola Lift\".  The slow ballad is about being a couple, in love and being together with hearts as one and growing old together and also dying together.  A touching song!\n\nThe three tracks that round out the single are the off-vocal versions of each song, which are pretty much the music no vocal tracks.\n\nAs for the DVD, the DVD comes with a total of five tracks.\n\nThe first music video is for \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" as AKB48 tries to revive this tree-like being by freeing it from its captivity.  Also, a dance portion featuring the group dancing.  In terms of the music video, for set design, this is probably an interesting video as it has this tribalistic style to it, with the tree-being almost reminding me a of Studio Ghibli character.  As for costume design, the costumes are quite subdued compared to other AKB48 costume design but I liked the choreography on a dirt like setting and seeing the dirt flow while the group is dancing.  Overall, a good video.\n\nThe second music video is for \"Kimi no Senaka\" and has more dialogue and features friends who get into a discussion about a guy they like, while another friend is moving away.  Like the lyrics to the song itself, it's happy and upbeat but also a hint of sadness as well.\n\nThe third music video is for \"Gondola Lift\" and this video is actually my favorite video on the entire DVD.  Not only is the song beautiful and touching, the music video shows what is behind the windows of an apartment building and we see an elderly man taking care of his sick wife, a family eating dinner and a young couple with a young woman who wants to marry her boyfriend.\n\nThe fourth music video is the \"DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! version of \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\", so no mystical creature is featured.  It's all dancing!\n\nAnd the final fifth music video is the \"Tokuten eizo AKB48 conte Taxi-hen\" featuring a comedy skit with Mariko Shinoda as a taxi driver and Yuki Kashiwagi as a passenger.  The skit revolves around a taxi driver who talks too much.\n\nOverall, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" is a wonderful and enjoyable CD single from AKB48.  While there are the different versions available for fans who may prefer certain singles showcasing their favorite performer, I personally chose this CD+DVD single because of its inspirational songs.  \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" is an inspirational song but \"Gondola Lift\" was a fantastic and touching Undergirls track with a music video that was just equally enjoyable.\n\nBut all tracks on this CD single showcase a nice balance of music from AKB48 as well as its DVD.\n\nOnce again, I'm pretty impressed with what Yasushi Akimoto has done with AKB48 and how hard these young ladies have come since 2005.  This is another addictive CD single and if you are an AKB48 fan, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru (Type-B)\" is highly recommended!","7615":"It wouldn't play. It just kept popping out of my CD player.

Avoid!","7621":"Not a huge rihanna fan, but I try to give her a chance. However this album disappoints as well, I expected more from her...not sure why at this point...","7622":"The Chicago Kingsnakes - Blue Mosaic (MusicKing Records)\nTheir first proper album since 2003's \"Grass Roots\", though they've busied themselves over the intervening years touring the world with Byther Smith and playing shows with Junior Wells, Jimmy Witherspoon, Cash McCall, etc. When added to the fact that Kingsnakes leader, guitarist-vocalist James Anderson, has played with everyone from Buddy Guy and Albert King to Son Seals, James Cotton and Koko Taylor, It's probably safe to assume that The Chicago Kingsnakes are some of the best and most respected blues players around.\n\nThat's certainly the impression I get from listening to \"Blue Mosaic\". Their style, unsurprisingly, is Chicago blues, and they play it slow and heavy, and tight and upbeat, and whatever way they play it, they play it well. Opening number \"Take Your Time\" is measured and intense, and highlights all their strengths, primarily great musicianship. When they're aiming to get feet moving on tracks like \"Blues Gone Uptown\" and the Sonny Boy Williamson(esque) \"Lefty\" - the latter with harmonica courtesy of Nelson Keaton - they sound like the ultimate blues bar band. It's another track, \"So Cold in Chicago\", that I find myself returning to. Another upbeat number, it's what they used to call a toe-tapper, but it's a bit more than that, and seems to be stuck on repeat.","7623":"I don't like the live version, I have no interest in hearing people yell or whistle, this was a great song that in my opinion was ruined but for some reason Tangerine Dream has made it to be the only way you can purchase it.","7624":"I received a Hollywood Sound effects CD and not the soundtrack\/audio for Ashlyn Gere's Realities from Zane Entertainment as in the description.

It's one of the must-buys if you don't want to buy the entire album.","7626":"Another song I hadn't heard in years.  Could not find for a long time.

It's only 2:14 but on Youtube the song goes for over 3 minutes !","7634":"This is probably the first recording of this song outside the composer's own, and more than a year before Harry Nilsson's version became famous from its use in Midnight Cowboy. It's a quiet, dreamy rendition with a drum opening and a light, Floyd Cramer-type piano accompaniment that gives it a country feeling, and strings to fill out the sound. A good rendition.","7635":"This is another CD by Sony and BMG of the same title \"Les indispensables\", search it at google and you'll see is the same CD whith different cover (the last one was yellow). If you're looking for the track When your heart is weak dance version, you're no going to find it here, even at the french amazon site you can see the tracks and this time they don't show the dance version title, although the track is listed twice.","7636":"This really is bad music. I'll stick to my own play list. I had to give it a star just to be able to rate it.","7637":"I purchased this as a gift for music enthusiast.","7638":"It's okay","7639":"Good","7640":"My type of song. Emotion and taste. Love it! Wouldn't have know about Jon black if it wasn't for the show, The United States Of Tara.","7641":"Excellent! Super fun, happy music that gets both children and adults moving to the beat.","7642":"Brought back wonderful memories for me while I was working at Merry-go- round clothing store!!!","7643":"Exactly as I remembered!","7644":"amazing voice, has an incredible ear for the correct note, able to sing with no accompaniment, and sings with feeling","7645":"The main reason I gave it only 1 star...& loath it so much....is not the music.  The volume of this MP3 is SO much louder, than the rest of the songs I have on my flash drive, that I hope it didn't harm my speakers, on the system I just bought this month.  WHY??!!\n\nWARNING...this MP3 could easily harm your stereo\/speakers!  It is WAY too loud.  I would like a refund on this song!","7646":"This is a great song Marie Miller has a beautiful voice and a love for the Lord. Have referred her music to others.","7647":"Great song Rodney!  Really shows the love of a father!!!  Love it!","7648":"I first heard this piece forty years ago and was immediately in love with it. It deserves to be much better known. Roger Roman, a pianist I have never heard of before, is a real find. He plays it with such verve and style and love. A very fine recording!","7649":"VERY Beautiful voice. I luv this song soooo much. If u like this song by Bruno Mars try it by Madding Thx for supporting her ;)","7650":"This is a Russian bootleg, and not the original print of this CD. Buyers BEWARE!! I bought this CD from this same seller a few weeks ago, and also have a copy of the REAL CD, and this is NOT REAL. It is a Russian bootleg that has been out for quite a while. Although it's a good bootleg, it's still a bootleg, so just beware you will only be buying it for the music, not for the rarity of the CD. If it's too good to be true, then it is!!","7651":"Southside's ill-fated attempt at making Top 40 type songs.  But Southside is still Southside, whether singing blues & soul  (\"Don't Look Back\" is a gem here) or sardonic pop songs, so it's still a worthy listen for fans.","7652":"Great voice.","7653":"Unfortunately some strange people have usurped William Warfield's vocal pcerformance. He was a U.S. Representative of the State Department to Africa, Asia, etc. And, he stressed such if you can sing--e.g. Spiriuals, you can sing Gospel; or, Bach. Nor, was finicky about how someone from a poorer background might respond to his singing. Whether a child to adult interrupted with \"Ohh\" or \"Awe,\" it was for him most important, that they be  given an opportunity to be exposed to something of beauty in their lives.","7654":"great","7655":"I came across \"Better Days\" the song on a WOW CD I bought while in Houston. The song, the voice, the message had me intrigued---who is Robbie Seay (band)! I arrived back on my base and ordered Better Days [the album]. I fell in love with the voice, the lyrics, the melodies. Some of the tracks are slow, and full of \"God's Breathe\". My favorites are Better Days (I play it every morning while getting ready for work), Faith of Our Fathers, Eternal God, and my all time favorite \"Jesus, Garden of My Rest\". I have to say that Jesus, Garden of My Rest literally brought me down to my knees crying and praising our Lord. The songs have touched me like no other song has. Michael W. Smith comes pretty close however.\nI am eagerly looking for more RSB albums, and will snatch them up as soon as they hit.\n\nThank you, Robbie, for helping me fall even deeper in love with Christ.\n\nFQ\nAl Asad, Iraq","7656":"The music stinks to me, but the dude does have a nice voice. I have to admit I don't like Contemprary Christian Music, just Jesus rock like REZ band or Glen Kyser blues Band.","7657":"First Of All it Was My favorite Song, Really Enjoyed Hearing It Again.","7658":"Another terrible mastering job. Clipped distorted mess. The mix is bad too. That aside the music Is also pretty bad. Sounds like the singer and band are on a different page. Not at all focused or tight. Maybe I am right and the band did the music then told a hired singer to put down whatever he felt like. Because that's as cohesive as it sounds. Awful sound makes it way worse. The first two Sabbat albums on vinyl are good. The remastered CD's sound really bad and this 3rd album is just plain BAD.","7659":"The Priests have fine voices that bring peace and calm to the human spirit. Very nice","7660":"Full disclosure: this is not a review of the performance. I have not purchased this album. Be careful what you choose from the Amazon Music library because many of the albums listed merely identify the source of the few tracks they offer.","7661":"This is a very good R&B song from Roy \"C', he did it again. Very nice...","7662":"Downloaded this for use in church service.  The information says this is 29 seconds long.  Not!  Even with the final reverberation it is at best 12-13 seconds.  Listening to the sample makes you think there is more, but what you hear on the sample is all you get.  Don't be fooled!","7663":"Tracks 23 and 24 are duplicates. This problem appears to exist on every service except iTunes. If you want this album, it may be better to download it from iTunes, despite the higher price. Alternatively, you could purchase it here and buy the faulty track (track 23) from iTunes as a replacement (if you don't mind mixing and matching MP3 and M4A formats).\n\nWill change my rating once Cobra Entertainment addresses this issue.","7664":"It's One of my favorite songs from the early 60's. Love the movie also. Gene Pitney had a great voice. One of the best!","7665":"Love this song, I always buy my music here on amazon, the cloud player lets me take it anywhere, and I even have some purchases here from CD's I bought 7 years ago!! and the digital tracks just automatically updated to my amazon cloud player! awesome!","7666":"Pretty sure that this musician was taken along with everyone else.  He certainly doesn't deserve a bad review for her deviousness","7667":"Just sickening!","7668":"I prefer them to sing in spanish","7669":"Love the songs but they are not preformed by the original artists but they are okay I guess l l","7670":"I saw Meghan perform at Vidcon 2012 and was blown away. Her voice is amazing. Check out her videos on YouTube ... then buy the album.","7671":"Great song for just chillin' out and relaxing. Looking forward to more chill-out \/ downtempo music from JustMusique in the future!","7672":"I use this and other Twinkle Twinkle... albums during rest time in my preschool classroom.  No annoying commercials from Pandora or iTunes radio anymore!  Added bonus, the eyes of adults in classroom during rest time light up when they decipher a song that is playing.","7673":"this song is not Leaving on the Morning Train, this is the wrong song.","7674":"This song is extremely upbeat and fun for children to do motions along with the German lyrics.  If you google the title of the song there is a UK website that has a translation of the words.","7675":"I hear wind chimes ... feel a cool breeze ... observe a vivid desert sunset ... experience a glorious sunrise ... see reflections on a glimmering lake's surface. The delicate and expressive \"chamber jazz\" of Pat Battstone (piano) and Richard Poole (vibraphone) will have you conjuring up many images of your own. As the two experienced musicians from Boston genially converse in an improvisational style, there are many musical moods created. Their second album release in less than a year, Battstone and Poole now feel that they have solidified their musical direction with additional maturity and an element of playfulness. They state, \"Mystery and suspense, call and response, have become more refined and our musical Voice has emerged.\" I find their articulate expressions to be quite dreamlike and perfect for easy-listening or meditative contemplation.\n\nBoth jazz musicians display an affinity for the avant-garde, and they're carving personalized identities as an amalgamation of their personal influences. For pianist Pat Battstone, we hear a personality that seems to incorporate styles of Marilyn Crispell, Keith Jarrett, Bobo Stenson, Charlie Banacos and Bill Evans. As far as vibraphonists go, I hear elements of Teddy Charles and Gary Burton (whose \"Dreams So Real\" album might have been inspirational). Originally from Ohio, Battstone attended the Berklee College of Music in 1973. He's done a great deal of solo and ensemble work, as well as teaching, producing and recording. Battstone doesn't just play the piano's keys. He may pluck the strings to produce overtones, or he may employ hammers directly to the strings. At present, he also works as a rocket scientist at Draper Labs in Cambridge, Ma.\n\nRichard Poole also has a long resume with many years as a professional musician.  He holds a Bachelor's Degree in Music Composition from Florida International University. Performance, production, a piano business and teaching have been his main focus over the years. He's helped many develop their own voice in music. Now, the two of them together are continuing to cultivate their own musical manifestations. Their kaleidoscope of magical sound is best described as an otherworldly soundscape of sensitive splendor, beautiful colors, and delicate textures.  (Joe Ross, Roots Music Report)","7676":"Was on e of my favorite songs from the 50's. I also like the Shirelles","7677":"love this song by these guys!","7678":"The wife loves this, helps her sleep.","7679":"I was not impressed with this windchime mix as it was too varied and sounds artificially looped. Check out David Sun's Wind Chime albumn. I was very much impressed with it and want to share it with all who are looking for slow, crisp, and clear windchime tracks.","7680":"Completely satisfied","7681":"I usually love Darren Criss singing anything and Chris Colfer singing most things, but this duet just wasn't a good choice for them.  Nice try!","7682":"I didn't notice at first that these songs were not done by the original artists.  It was a complete waste of money.","7683":"This collection is a bargain for a complete survey of Bartok's concerto output.  When you add the fact that the performers are among the best of one generation, and apt interpreters of this composer, you have a winning combination.  If you like Bartok, you will cherish this collection.","7684":"Love the music","7685":"OMG what a wonderful song. We all need help on our lifetime.","7686":"Neat song","7687":"The Homecoming Choir, the Nelons, & Guy Penrod combine to form a powerful new sound for a heart-gripping old song.","7688":"This song will stir the soul. David Phelps voice is so beautiful it brings so much emotion to the wonderful words of this song.","7689":"Love this song. It is like the writer knows me behind closed doors.","7690":"this song expresses the sentiment I feel and have never heard expressed in a song .... Amazing how the Lord answered my prayer through Jason's song ... Isn't the Lord amazing??","7691":"INSPIRATIONAL!!!!!","7692":"Love the message and really admire the singers","7693":"Really like this song though wish there was a good shorter version that I didn't have to buy a whole album to get (read: WOW Lime - really guys?). Good up tempo version. Sounds like the way we play it at church","7694":"I downloaded this song thinking it would be upbeat like another version of the song I had heard. this is nothing like what I was looking for.","7695":"great tune","7696":"Mahler symphony No. 5 is one my favorite, however there is a reason this version costs less than some of the others you can find.\n\nThis is a recorded public performance.  While listening you will hear the sounds of coughs, sniffles, crackling seats, page turning (from the orchestra), and other disruptions.  At one point, during a moment of quiet, I swear I thought I heard the sound of a draft, like you might hear inside a cave or something.\n\nI can't recommend this title at all.  Unlike in a movie theater, where you can try to ignore disruptors and focus on the movie, you can't focus here, because when you try to listen you can only hear them shift in their seats.","7697":"Like the original song but the sound quality is terrible for this version. Sounds like it was recorded directly from a car radio.","7698":"This is not \"Cage the Elephant\" song.  It is a rap song using the song \"Shake Me Down\" as background music. I had to remove it from my mp3 player.","7699":"What a talent!  I wish she had more recordings. A great mesh of music and voice!!  I couldn't wait to write a review here! Kudos to Melissa Fournier and composer Marc Karmatz.","7700":"I really like Latin Jazz (and Bossa Nova), and it doesn't get any better than this.  Ana Kruger has a fantastic voice that works really well with the song selections on this album.","7701":"I know the base for the song is O.R.T. sung by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, a fantastic vocalist and voice-actor.  What the shoddy, generic hip-hop music is that's layered over it, I have no idea.  I also can't seem to find any details about \"The Iris Project\" unless it's some sort of educational charity.  I gave it two stars because \"O.R.T.\" is great, but I have no idea why this specific version exists or how it can be sold while having no apparent link to Miss McGlynn, Akira Yamaoka, Joe Romersa, or Konami.","7702":"Excellent horn section.","7703":"Simplemente un gran canta autor orgullo de Venezuela...\nSu disco es de todo un poco, desde las bellas viejas inolvidables hasta nuevas canciones llenas de amor.","7704":"With the smooth, relaxing and emotional synths on top of chopped up vocal samples and wickid drums, Mokhov has definitely carved out `his sound' on this album.  No doubt my favorite song is Midnight Love.  It's one of those songs that brings out emotions inside of you didn't even know you had...  Looking for the next album and hearing you push the envelop even further.","7705":"Really love this piece.  Very heartfelt.  Love the harmony and simplicity of the words and music.  It touches my soul.","7706":"Not loving this song.  The clip was ok, but I guess I just don't like his approach to jazz.  Oh well...","7707":"Hugh Laurie's singing voice is dripping with emotion. I really like it. I bought this single and I bought other songs of his. I would love to see\/ hear him sing live.","7708":"Love song ","7709":"Awesome.","7710":"Love the fact it plays for over an hour. Great sound.","7711":"deep dish is deep","7712":"One of the best electronic mixes out there.  And a deal at this price.","7713":"Songs like N.M.P. (No More Pain), Love Yourself, Love Music, Promise Song and The D-Motion really makes this album worth your money. Although I've not really found a KAT-TUN song that is actually bad their are definetely some who rank way higher than others, especially N.M.P. which I haven't been able to stop listening to:)","7714":"This is great and interesting music. This is music that is both creative as well as being entertaining. I look forward to listening to future music contributions.","7715":"one of the best kept vocalist secrets of our time - i wish this guy would go on The Voice - such power, really great songwriter as well, these are acoustic unlike his other CDs but really help to highlight his vocal quality - feels like a house party, really intimate and friendly, great listening","7716":"Not a fan of Music Box..","7717":"loved it","7718":"What appears to be three import remastered CDs by the band Black Sabbath is actually only two.  The third, \"Paranoid\" is just a regular USA bargain bin copy.  I read the title over too fast and didn't absorb the fact that the CD I wanted the most because it was an import and remastered was not.  I feel a bit responsible and a bit duped.  So if you are after a good copy of \"Paranoid\" look elsewhere.","7719":"This is a great remix of the origial. Where the original was slow paced. Thid remix speeds it up and keeps the same energy.","7720":"I've been a Hicks & Licks fan for way over forty years and as such can tell everyone that this is absolute TRASH! Do NOT buy this! I made it all the way through it once and will never listen to it again. There are AT LEAST a dozen Dan Hicks and His\/The Hot Licks albums that sound WAY better than this crap--I should know, I have more than twelve of his CDs myself and listen to all of them regularly. Even with a couple of \"new\" songs on this album it's no good, much to my disappointment.\nMore important, now that Dan has passed on earlier this year (RIP, Dan!), do NOT buy any of his music that his family doesn't get some sort of benefit from, which apparently this garbage is. Want more? The songs on the disc run together, the sound is terrible, his classics are done in throwaway versions, etc., etc., etc. Where is the ZERO STARS rating when you need it? Somebody needs to be ashamed of themselves for this travesty.","7721":"The first time I listened to this song, I knew I had to buy it. It's the side of Stone Sour that I enjoy.","7722":"The Spanish is incorrect, and the pronunciation is terrible.  Plus it sounds like they recorded this in their basement with a tape recorded from the dollar store.  I am embarrassed for them.","7723":"The ending on this song is missing.\nI purchased the same digital song from a different album, same thing.","7724":"song","7725":"just another sex song...:(","7726":"Another great Guetta song","7727":"Listen to the Mad Men Theme music. Is it not the WORST TV Theme music you ever heard? I like the show but the music makes me want to change channels before it begins!","7728":"Great Song, what can I say... I needed that song for a party and it was easy to get, just downloaded it.","7729":"EXCELLENT....","7730":"Best song of all time <3","7731":"A lot of static in this song, poor recording","7732":"This product is not worth the money you get 17 seconds of one bird chirp it ia a rip off","7733":"The cd skips and looks like a cheap imitation. Played it once and tried to download on my ipod but the poor quality didn't allow for a download. Waste of money and time.","7734":"Good song that'll have you tapping your foot, nodding your head, shaking your hips and booty and singing along throughout the entire song","7735":"Beautiful voices, instruments.  I purchased this at a folk dance party and love it!  Some good Balkan dancing, and lots of easy listening","7736":"Great song but its nor at 320kpbs whats the point of paying Nything for this if its not high quality","7737":"All of the songs on this EP single sound good, especially track 1 (extended mix) and track 3 (Aurosonic Remix).","7738":"the cover was soaking wet. the album was scratched very badly. I have tried to return it but have not had any luck. not pleased at all","7739":"Great Accompniment track which I will use again and again.  A very beautiful rendition of an equally beautiful song.  Good choice.","7740":"This song is very inspirational and uplifting to the spirit of one who needs to be reminded at times of God's love for them!","7741":"Record came without the albums jacket.","7742":"So happy with this sound track! I been looking for this for so long!!!","7743":"Would've given 5 stars, but record skips on track one and two.","7744":"I buy records to listen to them.  This one is the worst sounding \"NEW\" records I have ever purchased.  I realize colored vinyl doesn't ever sound as good as black vinyl, but this one is exceptionally bad quality.  Dimples all over the record that will make your stylus skip, and it has loud background hiss throughout the record.  Listened to one side, shelved it, and there it shall remain.  You've been warned...!!","7745":"The vinyl had dimples in it, and it wouldn't play without skipping. I'm sure it would have been great though. :(","7746":"I love Matt Dusk's music -- another great from Canada's music scene! The romantic music is perfect when I'm trying to relax and it brings out my creative writing!","7747":"Kids love this song!","7748":"This wasn't what I expected\n Its more like music for a spa. I am disappointed. I like his other stuff much better.","7749":"I would love to love this recording but they cut the last last movement of the Schumann short so they could cram-in two mediocre works.","7750":"Every singer who wants to record a song of the Old West will include Chisolm Trail in their collection. Jack Elliott has the quintessential version. Not only does his song have energy, but it conveys such mirth and happiness. This is so very clearly evidenced by his phrasing of the chorus line as  \"Come-a-tie-yie-whoop-a-lie-yay\". I first heard Jack sing this on Pandora and had purchased it before the following song was over. Believe me, you can't go wrong with Jack's singing of this Western standard.","7751":"I loved the first two albums , yes they were, and was hoping to love their latest. No such luck. First two songs are OK but its all downhill from there. The vocals by the Alessi brothers are annoying, and where is the rock , remember White Tornado?","7752":"Wonderful  music and performance, but side two is so damaged that I'll never play it again.  Not the description put up by the vendor.","7753":"nice voice nice tunes everythings well put together I recommend you buy this album is really good thank you jesus","7754":"Considering the talent and their later work, I thought these were half-baked songs ( or ideas for songs) that didn't gell.","7755":"DISAPOINTED","7756":"I have loved this piece since I was a teenager, and that was a long time ago.  I was not familiar with Sarah Ainsworth, but her rendition of Claire De Lune is absolutely beautiful.  For those unfamilair with the music, it is very melodic and relaxing.  Well worth the money.  The vendor provided great service.","7757":"I work in a situation where beautiful music is appreciated & this works perfectly. I will purchase much more in the future.","7758":"I usually love Harnoncourt's brisk, rhythmically brilliant, beautifully faceted conducting, but this ... just isn't working. Most of the tempi are oddly slow, and the singing is only okay. Barbara Bonney is a surprisingly poor Adele ... \"Mein Herr Marquis\" completely misses the mark, with no sense that Adele is pretending to be a great lady. Many high notes are hooted. Gruberova's \"Czardas\" is excellent, but overall she is shrill and seems always a little under pitch. The German is weirdly \"chewed,\" which makes many of the musical lines feel spat-out and disconnected ... granted, German is a tricky language in which to both enunciate and maintain a clean line, but I've heard it done... just not here. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this.","7759":"I had to turn my system up almost all the way in order to even hear it , and I own a Bose.","7760":"Roy Orbison's voice is eerily augmented by K.D.Lang's .  It' a great version","7761":"This download sounds distorted - not pleased with the quality. Not pleased with it at all. Poor audio quality - can I get a refund?","7762":"I love this song.  It makes me get up and dance.  It does make me Feel Good.  I would advise people to purchase this if you need something to pep you up. It works.","7763":"I gave this a two star because the CD was not available.  I listen to it on my IPhone.  The music is a beautiful collection for MP3,  but I would also like the CD","7764":"Not really into this program.  Could not get interested!!!","7765":"What a wonderful song.....great lyrics, tune and it has such a soothing melody.  I enjoy the song each time I play it.","7766":"I love k.d. lang, but this is just not up there with my favorite versions of this haunting Cole Porter tune. It's not even really true to the melody.","7767":"Joe stinks like my balls!!  Luckily this review will roll right off his barely existent shoulders!!!","7768":"Joe Derosa is a cowardly liberal cuck.","7769":"Audio AIDS.\n\nPublished just 5 day before the anniversary of 9\/11 and that's not a coincidence.","7770":"a friend of mind told me about this , so i purchased it however it just really long and its think that is mislabeled as a comedy , i'm not sure what genre it would be though","7771":"Straight Trash  Help me fall asleep at night","7772":"It is my favorite song so far. So much sadness and passion is in Bulanova's voice. Hear it and see.","7773":"Not a fan. Misleading in my opinion.","7774":"Found this song on YouTube, so I bought it not the same. So I was very Disappointed in the mp3 I got.","7775":"This is Baroque music with a South American flavor. It is well done and could be of interest to someone who likes Baroque music. It is not Salsa music as it is currently understood.","7776":"I've had this disc for awhile now and can definitely recommend it to rock fans.  From the heartfelt melody of Fuse and Unbreakable to the energizing riffs on Paragon this album brings you the full spectrum.  If you aren't energized after listening to Secret Wars (the track, but also the entire album) you need to check your pulse.  Production value is top notch, this is not your typical debut.  Support independent artists, support genuine rock, do yourself a favor and grab this cd.","7777":"Love it!","7778":"It's not that it's a bad album, it's just not good for a Red Hot Chili Peppers album. I don't know one other album that they put out that only had 2 or 3 tracks that I liked.","7779":"I used to love the red hot chili peppers but they just lost their sound. It sounds like they made \"I'm With You\" just to make a few more sales and while they were at it they tried to market it to as many people as possible instead of make it based on artistic vision. In my opinion they completely sold out. R.I.P. The formally true men who didn't kill coyote.","7780":"Another great song by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.","7781":"Excellent","7782":"Good value getting 2 albums worth of songs on 1 CD.","7783":"These words, I wrote 40 years ago when the album was released. The presumptuousness of \"....Volume One\" for a 'superstar' (a word too much in vogue at that time) compelled me to write that terse review. Actually, it was not so much a review as an ad, part of several mini-photos and descriptions that were not much longer. Sherman, a likeable enough fellow, was on the TV series SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS as a parallel to Michael Landon's \"Little Joe\" character on BONANZA. So.......now you know! (For the record --- as it were --- I never listened to this collection. They didn't give us turntables. However, I notice you can buy one here at Amazon.com...!!!!)","7784":"Great Song - Her vocals are great and the sound from Avicii.  Pick this track up right now - you will not be sorry about it.","7785":"very satisfied. Its just what expected. i've been looking all over for this CD. i got the item before the actual date","7786":"I think the subject really says it all.  Frenetically chirping keyboards, with a couple atmospheric breakdowns, and an interesting vocal delivery make up the bulk of this song, and if that's your thing, you should buy this song my friend.\n\nI first got into Genevieve's music with her previous band Pollyn (also on Amazon), which is a lot more \"laid back\" in comparison to this venture with Louis Cole, so it's neat to her her voice in another setting.\n\nSide note - If you do like this track, check out the band Knower, because that is what these two (Genevieve and Lous) record under now.","7787":"I have always loved this disc--this is the third one I have bought because I wore the others out!","7788":"Typical 80's style AOR...immature songwriting and clumsy lyrics. If Simon wasn't Pete's brother, he would not be in the music business at all.","7789":"Yes, this band is almost so bad that you can't help but like them. I first discovered seventh Avenue back in the mid-1990s. I was really into bands like Helloween, Blind Guardian and the like; this band, was said to be very much like the other melodic, German metal acts that were popular in those days. Needless to say, I was curious and the artwork on the album covers seemed to call out for me to buy all of the available albums by Seventh Avenue in one fell swoop. The outcome of that purchase, Seventh Avenue does have a hint of Helloween and the like in their music, but there is one major difference here; and that is that Seventh Avenue's music can be so speedy, that it almost spirals out of control. Don't get me wrong, they have some good songs and you can hear that they're actually pretty good musicians on some of their compositions. It just seems that the guy who wrote all of the songs, is so concerned with being fast, Zippy full speed ahead metal that the songs can become almost incoherent. The guitars are so fast in some of the songs, that the lyrics sounds like they were squeezed in there with a shoehorn and bellowed out with no thought to where the melody was going. Hence, some of the songs by Seventh Avenue sound very amateurish and thrown together. Honestly, some of their music is as orchestrated as a random car crash. But yet, on some of the songs, their talent shines through and you find yourself actually liking this band despite the mess that may populate the rest of the album. Over the years, I have formed a like\/hate relationship with this band. If anyone is interested in picking up onep of their albums, I would suggest they start with South gate, this is the best of their offerings and is the most solid album they ever did. The rest of the albums have moments that shine, but also lots of moments that have one reaching for the Excedrin by the time the song is over.","7790":"Different song than what Pandora is playing. Pretty much a total waste of money and time. Really wish Pandora and Amazon would make sure they are directing people to the right songs.","7791":"I love the song, but it won't download to my device. What's the point of buying if I am unable to listen to it whenever I want?","7792":"I like the song but not so much the singers.","7793":"Don't get me wrong i love This Bike Is A Pipe Bomb, but this is a RECORD and the designed it with a few songs that really need a digital player ot sound good. I got into vyinl for better quality(no digital) and this record turns on that","7794":"This is Dan Wall's first recording from 1981, featuring all original material.  Shades of McCoy Tyner and Thelonius Monk, with a twist. Great keyboard work from Wall with beautiful accompaniment by Steve Grossman.","7795":"After waiting several years for new, original material from Boyz II Men, we finally have it with \"More Than You'll Ever Know\" featuring Charlie Wilson.  Mr. Wilson blends his voice in perfectly with the Boyz and it's a great duet. If there's more of this to come on TWENTY, Boyz II Men's 20th anniversary album, then fans will be overjoyed!  The lyrics are amazing.  Can you imagine the guyz singing \"Still number one in my eyes, til this day I still get butterflies\" to you?  Wow!  It's definitely a love letter written in song.","7796":"hate remix and of other songs!","7797":"Best arrangement I have heard of this song and I have heard many of them. It is played with much feeling.","7798":"A reasonably good compilation from a performer who I enjoyed in my youth.  Along  with Jimmy Smith, Dave \"Baby\" Cortez was one of my first introductions to the music of the organ, which was more exciting than the classical organ music and religious organ music that I had heard up until then and which turned me off.  Like most rock music from the period, it is more a collector's item than a classical must have part of a rock 'n roll collection; but - in my opinion - well worth having.","7799":"I couldn't hear the samples that should have been a warning. But I went ahead and purchased it. Its in my iTunes but there is no sound at all on any of the tracks. Any idea what is happening?","7800":"Most musicians love this song. the way Wayman plays it is a tribute to the originial. Love listening to this song while riding my cruiser down a long, sunny, winding road, while chasing sunsets.","7801":"not very good","7802":"First of all this is a two disc set. 'Land' which is more pop oriented, and 'Sea' which is more like poetry with a background of the most gorgeous lush symphony you have ever heard.\nSo beautiful it is heartbreaking.\nTruly a masterpiece!","7803":"If this band is so tired of Thurston Moore, why do they so slavishly copy his sound?  Really doesn't inspire me to get the rest of the album.  Neither clever, witty, or relevant-if you ask me.","7804":"Wrong song","7805":"A+  Can't go wrong w\/ George Strait!!!","7806":"Most of this CD is crowd-work. Rory Scovel wins the crowd over with generic, unoriginal banter. He seems like a funny guy, but the material is undeveloped. I've seen Rory present polished, gut-busting bits...but none were recorded on this CD.","7807":"One of the worst comedy cds I've ever heard and I've listened to too many to count. I listened through the whole thing and hated it. Would not recommend it to anyone. If you one a funny comedy cd, do yourself a favor and listen to John Mulaney or Mike Birbiglia instead.","7808":"I really enjoy this album by doop. Although I didn't really like the original song titled \"doop\", the re-recording of it on this album is actually pretty good. The rest of the songs are great. They're all incredibly catchy, and bring something a little different to the table. The only thing I am not crazy about are the 3 different versions of \"My Chihuahua\", however, they are still good songs.","7809":"A classic from my youth!","7810":"I downloaded this 3 times, I love this song, but it won't open on my computer. I normally don't have any problems but this song will not open","7811":"Awesome song.  Jackson performed it on Fallon last night and nailed it.  His voice is still golden.  First i'm hearing about the full album NOTE OF HOPE.  Inspired me to take a full listen.  It's pretty amazing.  Surprised it hasn't gotten more press.  It's WOODY GUTHRIE for pete's sake.","7812":"Used in my school drama play, perfect","7813":"Timeless song, She loves it. She loves it she love it she loves it she loves it she love it she lov","7814":"Great listen.","7815":"This recording is very poor quality: scratchy, muffled, and nearly beyond understanding. It sounds like it was recorded with a pillow over the mic. I know this is a rare performance (Cochran only performed it live, as near as I can determine, so this probably is not a studio recording), but Amazon should not be selling something this inferior.","7816":"Ringo's casual performance of a Buddy Holly classic has just enough punch to be enjoyable and enough charm to sound fresh. Always a treat when he hits on a song in the range of his voice and delivers it with such ease. I've thought it over and decided I like it.","7817":"Am I only able to listen to th is on the Amazon app?","7818":"Great song. Love it!","7819":"Lego M is not singing in this version as implied.","7820":"This version of 'Everyday' brings some of Patrick Stump's 'world music' style to the Buddy Holly classic. This piece has been overplayed a lot, leading people to think it's low-energy or outdated. The addition of some percussion (marimba, in particular) to the intro and rhythm tracks makes a nice update, and helps people hear the song's energy again. One of the greatest things about Buddy Holly's music was his personal style, but this album has many artists 'doing their own thing' with his songs. I was very pleased to be able to download just this track (definitely the best one on the album) through Amazon.","7821":"Great cover of Nirvana's song.","7822":"GREAT SONG - YOU HAVE GOT TO HEAR THIS SONG ON GOOD SPEAKERS, IT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!!!!!!!!LOVE IT","7823":"I generally do not like tribute lp's......but this one is worth not only the listen but the price of the disc or down-load.  2 of the best cuts are Stevie Nicks and Lyle Lovett.  Buddy Holly's music gives real meaning to the term ageless, as his music works as well or even better today then when it was released originally.  Peter Allen .....  made great choices in matching performers with songs.  Buy it !!! You will not be disappointed....","7824":"I love Stevie Nicks rendition of this old buddy holly song.  Her voice adds a unique quality to one of the all time favorites. Gets me up and going each day!","7825":"Love it","7826":"Great song, daughter and I love it.","7827":"I remember this band and they were great. Not anymore. This CD just got thrown on my pile to unload on EvilBay! Sounds like your typical 90s Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, etc crap. Save your money!","7828":"Very cool addition to my Buckcherry collection. I just wish it contained a few more tunes and maybe a tour guide of the Austrialian leg.","7829":"LOVE IT,","7830":"My husband loved this song from the first time he heard it and he's been disappointed that it hasn't gotten more air time on the radio.","7831":"Man. I get hype hearing ross go \"Whoa\"","7832":"Garbage. Hate this crappy s***. Talentless hack should go back to his job working as a corrections officer. Total waste of money.","7833":"Love this song!!!!","7834":"I would give this song love don't run a five star rating because I was on a trip and my family listen to the song over and over again.","7835":"This CD has songs that are unlike any other I heard on SmoothJazz.com -- love the Balngladesh \"flavor\" of the 2 songs I downloaded (\"A Simple Plan\" & \"Rain Check\").  Excellent blend of traditional music & smooth jazz; will probably seek more songs to download!","7836":"I've always loved this score and am thrilled to see it finally available, even if it is only a digital download and not a CD.\n\nHowever the version here is a disgrace. Amazon has left off the last 4 tracks from the album. They also charge nearly twice as much for this butchered version as Mr Lindes does in the store at his official site, hallindes dot com.\n\nGo to his site to buy the full 15-track version.","7837":"Came faster than expected, and in great condition.  Even came with a hand-written note and a lovely little origami crane.  10\/10 would buy again.","7838":"it was okay! I was not so impressed wirh his singing.  i have heard better. could not understand the words.","7839":"I bought this CD as a gift, so I have not listened to it yet.  My goal was to get Beethoven performed by the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra, and this is IT!  The surprise was that it is from China, and all the descriptions on the cover are in Chinese!  Since it's Beethoven, I'm not too worried about that, but it might have been nice to read whatever is printed on the jacket!","7840":"This collection of songs isn't worth the money. There are some good songs here, but the sound quality is horrible. I compared some songs to ones I downloaded on iTunes of the same name, and some of them sound as if they were recorded through a tin can. Several songs are mislabeled, and some of them are not even \"Crooner\" songs. Avoid this.","7841":"Honestly I already had the regular version of this CD but I love YUI and is sort of a collector of her albums so I decided to get it.\nThe DVD is like Region 2 or something so I can't really play it since I live in the US but get this CD if you are a hardcore fan like me!","7842":"Prior to listening to this I have NEVER heard the 3rd person Plural in English referred to as Y'all.  They should be ashamed of themselves!","7843":"Thanks","7844":"If you enjoy celtic folk or rock this is a catchy tune to listen to, great voices and acoustic guitar.","7845":"Great music, and it's a nice break from mainstream.","7846":"Very haunting and lovely","7847":"Love it.  Great music.","7848":"Very poor sound quality on most tracks","7849":"Making a Scottish CD and only chose to not use about 3 of the songs on this album.  Nice mixture of stirring and sentimental favourites.","7850":"This music cd is excellent thank you Charles Ferguson ,","7851":"I ordered the digital download of this recording so my family could sing along as they prepare for a production of Oliver.\n\nUnfortunately, 5 or so of the .MP3 files were mis-labeled. All the songs were there, but it was surprising\/annoying to hear \"Oom Pah Pah\" when you played the track titled \"I'd Do Anything\".\n\nI'm fairly tech savvy, so I did manage to sort out the track titles, filenames and info with an .MP3 tag editor, but that was more work than I bargained for. Ah well, the show must go on!","7852":"Easy download, awesome song, exactly the one I was looking for. I would purchase music like this again. Very happy with Amazon music.","7853":"Urban Skies is a combo of world beat, flamenco and latin jazz! Great!","7854":"Spicy, rhythmic and fun, this artist fuses Jazz, Latin and Pop genres of music that will get you off your seat and onto the dance floor. Original songs, gritty in topic and moving in spirit, this is the first of many that we hope will come from this New York artist.","7855":"The musicality of all the layers of piano, Native American flute and prayer chanting, along with synthesizer is like....what I imagine being in Heaven must be like.  I heard this song on a Native American music station that I haven't been able to find since, but I'm elated to find this music available on Amazon.","7856":"My grandparents love Norah Jones, when I heard Rosi I knew they would love her too. Perfecr ! Love it!","7857":"Love this song","7858":"I lvoe this song it is just very pleasing to the ears, it puts you in a very positive and relaxed state of mind. It was of Peabo Brysons best songs in my opinion, but it is one that I don't get to hear often so when I heard it recently I knew I had to find and purchase this classic R&B soul melody.","7859":"These are recordings by unknown people, not the originals I was expecting.  Not a very good album","7860":"Pretty disappointing. All the selectios are so overused and familiar even if you down know them by name. Stick with good movie soundtracks like \"Out of Africa,\" \"Somewhere n Time,\" \"Sophie's Choice,\" The Hours,\" and \"Shindler's List.\"","7861":"Not very good!!  The instrumental was good but the singing on some of the songs was terrible!  Don't purchase this.","7862":"When something says  \"movie soundtracks\"  one would naturally assume you are getting the actual Movie soundtracks, not some wanna be orchestra playing them, their version and some sounding like nursing home or elevator music.  Do Not Recommend... worst $6.99 I ever spent.","7863":"I am not a scholar of Nielsen's work so I do not know if there are better recordings but this sounds good to me. I especially enjoyed the quartet in F major.","7864":"I bought this album three days ago and it has been on repeat ever since. I just saw the cover and decided to listen to some of the songs on itunes. \"Truth\" and \"Beginning of the End\" just spoke to me! I thought for 8 bucks what the hoot. So I bought the whole album and love it!! Also on Itunes all his reviews (74) had 5 stars (well two dudes gave him 4). And his previous albums as a whole also had 5 stars. Definetly no regrets! This guy really is incredible, and he writes all his own stuff. I have never heard of this guy, but he officially does have a new fan. If your looking for a new voice and lyrics that seem to just written to you then pleas do yourself a favor and buy the album.","7865":"I downloaded this on accident. I was trying to get the original version. This song is okay, the melody and beat is a bit generic though.","7866":"Awesome","7867":"I loved their version of \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\".","7868":"love this.","7869":"It's ok.","7870":"I heard a clip of Harlem Nocturn on one of the Mike Hammer audio books and thought this was it ... I was wrong. It's to much Jazz and not enough Blues.","7871":"I have this already. But I thought that this was an extended version. I had heard it on TV, on the music channel. It was from the Disco Years Collection. So because it said 7\", I thought it was the extended version.","7872":"Very encouraging song","7873":"After listening to this .mp3 in its entirety, I discovered that this version is inexplicably missing a measure of the recording. Most people wouldn't notice it, but it does disturb both the harmony and makes the number of measures uneven. Look for the other copy of this song under its proper name: the title of this selection is not 'Eddie Was a Lady' but rather 'Eadie Was a Lady'. My support of LGBT rights notwithstanding, the former would must needs be a very different song and I suppose it is debatable whether Merman would have performed it. Nevertheless, Eadie Was a Lady is one of Merman's signature tunes, although the show for which it was written seems rather deservedly forgotten. I would call this version, with a rousing orchestration by Jay Blackton, arranger and conductor of the famous Merman\/Martin duet for the Ford Motor Company 50th Anniversary telecast (now available elsewhere on Amazon,) the definitive rendition. Other performances changed the words (there were certain subjects you just couldn't mention on television, and prostitution was one of them) and others suffer from less than ideal sonic properties. This one combines one of Merman's most enthusiastic performances of the song with a very decent pre-hi-fi recording and the splendid Blackton orchestration.","7874":"I have had the good fortune to live with the new Scott Matthews album, What the Night Delivers,  for a little while (courtesy of signing up for an early copy as a result of being at the superb Wolverhampton show a couple of weeks ago) Its official release on San Remo Records isn't due until September when it comes out alongside a raft of shows around the UK. It can however be ordered now through his website for those who, understandably, can't wait until then.\n\nHaving heard a few of the songs from the album at earlier shows, and hoping they presaged a set of songs that engendered the excitement of the first album, I didn't want to rush into comment for fear of letting my hopes run away with me. But now I know the whole set a good deal better and, without being a retrograde step,  they are a return to the things that first grabbed me about Scott Matthews.\n\nGone is what was, in hindsight , the slightly over-blown band sound of Elsewhere and here is a determinedly intimate and up-close album, concentrating on the Mr M's vocals and guitar work, an album of rare delicacy and lightness of touch. After hoping for an album like this, what a triumph, what a relief!\n\nAlthough the band takes more of a back seat, there are none the less some most excellent supporting musicians - Sam Martin on drums and percussion,  Greg Stoddard on lap steel (even more rewarding in a live situation), the fine Danny Keane on cello and Danny Thompson on double bass.\n\nAs suggested by the title, What the Night Delivers, is in many respects music made for the dark, the quiet, the solitary long drive on night-time country roads - not an album to get them out and dancing in the aisles, and thank goodness for that.\n\nThere are tantalising echoes of the first album Passing Stranger - not just in the atmosphere, but some of the structures, perhaps not quite so overt this time, but still there - the almost-tracks such as at the very start before Myself Again and once more the last minute of Bad Apple leading into So Long, My Moonlight -  musical cameos, perfect in their own way but also creating a little more space and air between songs.\n\nAlso in evidence is the Indian influence of before - notably in the beautiful walking Home in the Rain, but fleeting glimpses elsewhere in rhythms and intervals, the tabla on Bad Apple for instance.\n\nTo my mind there is not a weak track here, but that doesn't mean that there aren't a few particular stand-out tracks, for me these include Ballerina Lake, Head First into Paradise, Echoes of the Lonely, the aforementioned Walking Home in the Rain.\n\nThe album gives off the same vibe that you get from Scott's more intimate and stripped back shows (such as the two Wolverhampton shows at Newhampton Arts  - in 2011  and 2009 ). These are personal and direct, uncluttered by unnecessary effects and additions, and similarly here on this album everything has a place and a purpose. A joy and delight form start to finish, anyone yet to catch him live should make the effort for the dates in the autumn, you cannot fail to be impressed. I hope Mr M doesn't mind but below I have popped my own little vid of The Man Who Had Everything from the Wolverhampton show just recently - apologies for the light level - should he not want it here I will happily remove, but it does give a hint of how the new material comes over live.","7875":"excellent lp","7876":"I actually got this by mistake.  Never even heard of Tommy Bruce.","7877":"Great Song, just very damn difficult to download. I bought it, I should be able to download it to my own collection, with ease, not with so damn much difficulty.","7878":"This is a favorite song of mine. This version is not a very good one.","7879":"This record was in a terrible condition: dirty with all sorts of surface noise  A rippoff!","7880":"This group is from England.  MTV and VH1 defined this group as grunge, like Nirvana, Collective Soul, Marcy's Playground, Ned's Atomic Dustbin, Stoneroses, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, etc.  I watched Bush concerts on TV.  It looks worth attending.  I think I heard all the Bush songs, however, I stumbled onto this song while watching one of their concerts on AXSTV Ch. 340 recently.  I had to write down a couple of the lyrics to search for it by \"song lyrics\" on Yahoo, my favorite search engine.","7881":"Very lovely!","7882":"Very soulful & sultry song but the lyrics are what stands out the most because we live in such a shallow world & so many people are after a superficial thrill","7883":"False advertising! This isn't the \"Steal my Sunshine\" that I was expecting. This version of the song is interrupted several times by the musicians having dumb little conversations that totally mess up the flow of the song. I wish I could get my money back.","7884":"Good times =)","7885":"Sometimes this happens when you're legally blind.\n\nIt is the only version of a semi-signature song for sale....but it is not at all the iconic version. Whatever those words are on the cover are probably the clue, but they're not visible to my screen reader. I'm glad I only wasted $.99.","7886":"I have listened to a many Zen-like tapes along the years, but Zoe Sameth's Deep Relaxation tape has made a huge difference in my life.  Her voice is uniquely smooth and calming, and the background music is delightfully nature-invoking.  Encouraging the listeners to adapt her instructions to their specific needs, her guidance inspires them to connect with their own love and light in a very touching fashion.  The tape also has a bonus of 30 minute additional minutes of just music, ideal for further personalized relaxation.  It accompanies my regular yoga practice right after the deep relaxation--making a huge difference especially when I most need it!\n\nGabriela","7887":"Free or not with my membership I wouldn't have this krap.","7888":"I love this show. I saw it  so many times in the seventies.\nI just didn't need ti have the entire album downloaded THREE times! And the download took ALL day","7889":"\"Ballad\" seems inadequate.  I found this poetic, intimate and not a little melancholy -- lyrically superior to much of the music I also enjoy.","7890":"\"Day By Day\" is the best song on the Godspell soundtrack and it was a big hit back in the early 70's. This is a classic song that can do no wrong!","7891":"that is all there is to say my favorite song . easy to down load even i could do it.","7892":"Downloaded this for adding a bit of realism to my weapons and tactics class. Dissapointed. Its very quiet and unclear. Not worth a buck.","7893":"it's just Jan Jelinek, trying to make money off of those that want support an electronic woman artist. Disgusting.","7894":"Music that sounds exactly like madness.","7895":"Leona Lewis is a powerhouse with an amazing voice. This song is extremely disappointing and generic. Also, if you listen closely some of it makes no sense! I believe she is capable of better.","7896":"I love this mp3 album well worth it. I do love Jpop and the mixture of dubstep with it. Purely awesome! I personally got into Jpop because I realized how Americans have such bad taste in music nowadays. I mean seriously how did Justin Bieber get so damn popular with the girls or every1 for that matter? Then we got all the others who really suck and I just hate michael jackson because he's gay for raping little boys... Enough said. Jpop is waaaaay better!","7897":"The combination of vocals on this album surprised me in so many ways---all in all I came away loving many of the tracks and loving the combo of Joss Stone, Mick Jagger and the others on several of their hits. I highly recommend this album to those who love all types of music---i am a lover of all rock sounds, but this combo had unexpected upbeat vocals as well as some slow mellow tunes---all in all a terrific album to add to one's collection.","7898":"I listened to the samples before buying this album and was really impressed with the variety and the overall musical vibe from the different songs.  After buying it, though, I'm convinced that I should've stuck to listening to the samples.  The problem is that something which seems clever and interesting for 20 seconds sometimes becomes quite borrowing when you drag it out to 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 minutes with minimal musical variation.  The album has a lot of different feels to different songs, but each song winds up repetitive and dull with no worthwhile lyrics to keep the listener engaged.  As a result, the overall impression from the album is just that it's dull and uninteresting.  If they'd mixed the whole thing down to 10 minutes instead of 50, it would probably be fantastic.","7899":"With all the buzz around it, obviously this album generated high expectations.. But after listening to it few times, I think it is pathetic. The title song sounds like some track from Shaggy!","7900":"Nice feel and flow for a big group,Jagger and D. Marley sound great together with Stone doing her THING. A much needed break from The chili peppers and lil Wayne or the other albums of this year.","7901":"This isn't the actual Nyan Cat song, just the keyboard version.  The lyrics, while simple, do bring something irreplaceable to the piece.","7902":"as it should be","7903":"Love this song","7904":"Love this song! I had some free mp3 credit and decided to buy this song since it is really a kick ass version of Hatsune Miku songs. Plus, I don't have to rewatch the video a million times anymore because now I have the movie on my mp3 player, woot!","7905":"Great Album","7906":"I could not even get through the free 30 seconds. I expected a LOT more from Leona. She is a talented artist but this has lame written all over it.","7907":"I love chamber music and enjoy listening to selections played on FM stations while driving. Had hoped this would be a good alternative to the radio, but the selections are somehow disjointed, some seem poorly recorded. Not a music expert, but I am a part-time musician (folk, blues, bluegrass, Irish) who listens primarily to classical selections and I know what I like.  Unfortunately, can't say I particularly like this collection but it was certainly cheap enough so not much lost for the experience.","7908":"If life is a bowl of cherries, tell me what I'm doing here...stuck in the pits. Shrub read my mind.","7909":"When Louise Baranger conceived this project, she picked on all the usual suspects and they all delivered. From Chris Martin, principal of the Chicago Symphony to Allan Vizzutti, the seminal crossover classical-jazz artist, many of the brass world's greatest luminaries graced this paen to beloved professor, trumpet virtuoso and dear friend to all of us trumpet players: Fred Mills. For me, though, the most poignant moment came as Ron Romm stepped forward to say goodbye musically to his fellow Canadian Brass co-conspirator. Performing with his wife, Avis, Ron played about the most touching version of Somewhere Over the Rainbow this side of Judy Garland. To buy this CD is pay tribute to one of the kindest, gentlest, most generous and flat-out brilliant artists of our time and contribute to a most worthwhile cause - a scholarship to be awarded each year to a particularly deserving young musician given in Fred's name. I heartily recommend this two-CD set to all who knew or ever heard the great music Fred created and then imparted to his many students over the years. Yes - this is indeed a treasure offered to Fred with Love.","7910":"This loving compilation, a tribute to trumpet great Fred Mills, should be in the library of every brass player. In the double CD you will find jazz, classical, solo and every type of ensemble performances, all played by the best players in the business.

Nobody disrespects the Providence Bruins in our house!","7913":"No real advice, no real application of the laws of attraction to weight loss. Instead, it's an anecdotal story that turns into an advertisement for another book and website [...] Seriously, don't bother.","7914":"Love her!","7915":"Wrong version!","7916":"Its ok, but I would have enjoyed a different version better. With a variety of moves involved, I wanted to use this for a water aerobics class.","7917":"I have owned this song before and this was a duplicate purchase for convenience, however it doesn't sound like the version I have always enjoyed playing at gigs....  whats up with that?","7918":"The music was not what I was expecting it to be and it was not easy to enjoy.  I would not buy this groups music again.","7919":"The MP3 'Genera' for the MP3s on this album gets labeled 'Childrens Mix'.  The mix is as the other reviewer said - not the original artists.  If you are used to dancing or exercizing to these songs you'll be disappointed with this mix.  The depth in the music isn't there so you won't feel like dancing to the music.","7920":"None of the songs on this MP3 album are original.  All the other songs are reproductions by other bands.  While the recording quality of the songs is fine, they are lackluster when compared to the originals.  If having close approximations to the songs is okay with you, then you get a lot of songs for the money.  But otherwise, pass on this album and buy one with the original tunes, or buy the MP3's one by one.","7921":"Awesome tune! True to classic Bon Jovi anthems this song rocks!!","7922":"I actually found this song and band on Google's Play All Service. However, their pricing is a scam... I was already paying $8.00\/month for the service but was being charged full price for all purchases. So, I came back to Amazon to purchase my music :)","7923":"I can't imagine why Basia had to team up with another female vocalist I've never heard of and actually has a weak voice in comparison to hers. Was she doing her a favor...hmmm.","7924":"This song is from \"It's That Girl Again\" and while that version features the typical production value from Basia complete with Bossa Nova and Samba hooks this version is stripped down and Basia's voice higher in the mix. The bare bones arrangement makes this song more intimate and I prefer this version over the original.  I wish Basia would record a bit more frequently, I was surprised this album was released so soon after \"It's That Girl Again\" I hope it won't be another ten years for the next one.","7925":"I bought this to be downloaded as a ring tone.  I'm pretty sophisticated about such things, but I was never able to get it down loaded!","7926":"This is insipid crap of the worst possible order.  A waste of time, a waste of money.  The only thing that would improve it would be the apt sound of a toilet flushing.","7927":"So good, kept my foot a tappin' and my head a bobbin'. I had to transcribe the Christian solo..... NOT EASY","7928":"fun line dance song","7929":"Makes you want to move.","7930":"I am a big fan of PVD and I have most of his remixes and have seen this man perform live he is suppose to be a trend setter in the musical world of trance\/electronica.  This CD of bonus beats is garbage, this cd has hip hop samples that is not all that they are just simple break beats.  I would think if PVD is going in this direction you would expect it to be a lot better, especially with the different programs that he uses (ABLETON and SERATO LIVE) I could understand if he would create a fusion of hip hop and trance beats.\n\nPVD is losing it this and between VOLUME, REVOLVER remix and this he should just go back to the studio and create a cd like IN BETWEEN.","7931":"Does not download, or even show in my music library, much less allow for online playing...","7932":"I was hesitant to be the first reviewer some four years after this was released, especially since I am giving it one star.\n\nThis falls under the category of being caught up in the moment at a live show with a few too many drinks in me, and then buying the CD from the artist at the end. In this case, it was when he was the lead singer for Blood, Sweat & Tears. I get the CD home and it is nothing at all like what I saw at the show. Sure, he has a great voice and stage presence, but the songwriting on this is so contrived to appeal to gullible women that I am actually ashamed to own this one. To the used bins it will go.","7933":"I find new songs and old ones I've forgotten about for hooping and jumping by listening to Pandora. I ran across \"Song Of The Old Rake\" a few months ago. For either listening or exercise, this is a great song.\n\nIf you're interested in my hooping and jumping videos, search for QFEGuy on youtube, and I have a blog. You can also search for  \"Quest For Endorphins\". Nothing is for sale - I'm trying to demonstrate the shape you can be in and how much fun you can have exercising when you're 66; 67 in a few days.","7934":"Only got 60 songs..... WACK","7935":"The Stanley Brothers were the best of their  era and have stood the test of time","7936":"The song is fine and dandy, but it is NOT 'Electric Chair' by The Suicidal Flowers.  Not even close.  I doubt I\"m ever going to find the original track but now I at least know what album to search for.\n\nI'm still giving it two stars because it's a pretty nice song...","7937":"Great song","7938":"These songs are what didn't make it on the original \"Sex Style\", which is a classic, and this album still blows away any hiphop put out today.  Kool Keith is an artist, a true original in a genre which is getting increasingly boring. Grind up all your JayZ, Kanye, Drake, Eminem and all that mainstream hogwash. Grind it up and dump it on your garden, as that crap will surely help the garden grow. Then, bring the family inside and set them down in front of the stereo, and have Keith teach them about the birds and the bees.","7939":"Exceptionally good material -- well worth it.","7940":"One of the most touching songs of all time....","7941":"Love this one. It has the Messianic beat.","7942":"There's not much to say about 24\/7, except he may be the most underrated battler I've ever seen. His debut album is an instant classic and brings so many different levels of awe. I hope he makes it big. I'll follow him for years to come.","7943":"After hearing 2 songs from this guy before this album dropped, I figured it would be a decent album with just raw rapping and not much actually being said.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe album is entirely produced by Tony Mahoney from the UK, and the beats are all very dark and depressing, none of them being traditional hip-hop type beats, the instrumentation ranges from horns to an upright bass even to an accordion on one track. The album is 12 tracks divided into 3, 4 track parts. To simplify the three parts they could be labelled as Sadness, Anger, and Self-Analysis respectively, while through the whole project he struggles in his fight with alcohol. By the end of the first track you realize that this album is going somewhere serious and you're in for a ride, when you get to the third, The Underground, you start to figure out 24's opinion on hip-hop is very atypical. Not to call it right or wrong, but he doesn't want to make ignorant club bangers an street anthems, but he also not concerned with getting the fans away from it. He expresses the intent to make his music the way he likes it because hip-hop isn't worth saving for an ignorant audience. Track 4 comes in, the melody of the beat is a lady singing in Spanish over the harmony of an acoustic guitar. He keeps the song relevant to the album, furthering his status as a loner while flexing his raw rapping skills more than any other track on the album. Ridiculous bars such as \"Take a shot to the head and listen to Cobain.\" and \"Thinking you on C's level but you 20,000 leagues under me.\" and a double time spat clean enough to make Tech N9ne nervous. Enter part 2, Anger. Cam feels the need to say \"F*** you\" to a lot of people, starting with fans that won't leave him alone on The Neverending Story of The Parasite, asking them\n\n\"Wanna go to my school and get my degree for me? Go to my job and work these 40 hours a week for me? Come up with these ideas and think for me? Have battles every night with these drinks for me? You wanna know how it feels to always be drunk at home? How it feels to live life without a comfort zone? No? Alright cool then stop asking me stupid questions and leave me the f*** alone.\"\n\nThe next target is the record executives pushing young artists into neglecting their skills and churn out simple mega-hit singles, the last target is the government on The Warden, I felt this song was misplaced, it fits the mood of the album but not the themes so much. I briefly discussed the album with 24\/7 himself and he said he felt the same way while writing it, but he explained it as he's so angry with the world at this point in the album that he's getting everything off of his chest all at once before he gets into the final act. One thing in particular I liked about The Industry and The Warden was that in the first verses of each he rapped from the perspective of the record executive pushing the rapper to sign the contract and the government official filling our heads with propaganda and assuring us that they know what's best respectively.\n\nPart three is at least as personal as the first, probably more. My Apologies delivers precisely what it promises, he realizes that he is just as flawed as everyone he has spouted off at. Now that he's alone he's trying to make amends for all the isolation he has placed himself in. Battle Cry has the most positive vibe of any song of the album, almost as if he's sobered up and cheered up, starting to realize where he stands in life.\n\nTrack twelve comes in. It started with the sound of empty bottles clanging together, and he almost-mumbles the words \"They say alcohol is man's worst enemy, but the bible says to love your enemy. That's word to Frank Sinatra babyyyyy.\" The song is almost like a relapse, he displays a mixture of cockiness, and frustration almost as if he's back to where he was in the first two parts. The piano and upright bass keep playing long after the lyrics end, and that's it.\n\nThis is 100% honestly one of the best albums I've ever heard. It's genuine, personal, and poetic. At 22 years old, and this being his 1st album, an incredible potential to do something very big for rap is shown.\n\n\"I won't be compared to Eminem, Lil Wayne or Hov. More like Fitzgerald, Hemmingway and Poe.\"\n-24\/7","7944":"Roy C is an excellent soul singer who sings about relationships and love. I am so happy that I was able to locate some of his music.","7945":"Technically brilliant. Lenny keeps the essence of Beethoven and turns it into great jazz.","7946":"I've had the pleasure of seeing Josh Young on stage as Marius in Les Mis (national tour), Che in Evita (Stratford Festival), and Judas in Jesus Christ Superstar (Stratford Festival).  I knew he was a phenomenal talent, and when I first listened to this album, it blew me away.  If you like listening to a pure talent singing great music, I'd encourage you to buy this album - and also catch Josh as Che in the upcoming tour of Evita.","7947":"I had the great privilege of seeing Josh perform the role of Judas Iscariot in \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" this week.  His performance took my literal breath away, so I went home and purchased his newest music, and was not disappointed.  Only further intrigued!\n\nI am not a music critic, only a fan of music, so forgive me that my review is not technical.  Only  emotional!\n\nJosh's voice pours out like honeyed wine.  Yes, it is sweet, but he can also deliver such sadness and pathos, that adds a tartness, a crispness to songs we have heard before.  The song \"When She Loved Me\" was a great favorite of mine already, and this rendition is so singular, so moving.  I found a new respect for the lyrics, and for how artists intrepret various songs.\n\nI am not ashamed to say my eyes welled up during \"The Rainbow Connection\", a song that lovers and dreamers have adopted for 30 years.  He brings a gorgeous voice to the sentiment, and it's never corny or false, the feeling comes through and touches, even penetrates the listener.\n\nEvery song carries Josh's passionate, but angelic stamp.  He is the angelic voice that is burnished by a fiery humanity.  I recommend his music to any and every one who wants to be moved, transcended.\n\nI have wishlist of songs that I would love to see Josh do for his next project, but would be equally happy with whatever he chose to interpret.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Still-Dreaming-of-Paradise\/dp\/B005JOH4HO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Still Dreaming of Paradise<\/a>","7948":"Didn't keep this version","7949":"I new what  I wanted  and got  it. The distributors were  excellent.","7950":"Mad mike really knows how to keep s*** real with this ghetto style bass mix. All the beats on this CD are great but this is by far my favorite.","7951":"great song =-]","7952":"It's too bad that artists split out their albums in a selling forum that doesn't provide enough information to make an informed choice. I found this using my kindle, and bought it because nothing stated it was only 3 minutes long. I turned on my kindle, adjusted the volume, and settled down for a bit of relaxed listening, but it was over by that time. It's a very simple and nice message , but it shouldn't be for sale on its own.","7953":"I am a big fan of Bhagavan Das.  He sounds terrible on this live cd.  I listened to it once and I could barely make it through.  I am probably going to throw the cd in the trash because it makes me sick to look at.  Waste of money.","7954":"My new favorite band!","7955":"These are all covers and junk","7956":"All I heard was a thunderstorm.  VERY faint was the sound of a moan or whisper.  Very disappointed!","7957":"This is a tribute song to singer John Denver. It is going down as one of my all time favorites. I loved John and this song is a wonderful remembrance of the man he was.","7958":"Thought it was something else, not to expensive to buy, just one song.  No other comment for the reader.  Sorry","7959":"Awesome song by a great group. Ahead of their time for sure! Still sounds great as it did years ago.","7960":"For anyone who is old enough to remember The Lemon Pipers and their 60s hit, \"Green Tambourine,\" you may remember the electronic slide that characterized that recording and marked it as a trendsetter. Rick Coghill was the guitarist and created the effect. In this Messianic Christian (Rick is not Jewish but adopted the nickname \"Levi\" for laughs) live performance, Rick gives an amazing performance by taping a reed to his mic, putting his mouth over it and does the voice of God as well as some neat vocal riffs to complement lead singer Joel Chernoff. This is truly good stuff... and the live performance is even better that the album cut (IMHO).","7961":"Not a good version. Deleted it.","7962":"Grandkids love this and dance hilarious! I ","7963":"Its a ok sing for a smaller child but not a older one.","7964":"Bloodshot Records has alot of oldies that bring childhood back. Fun to hear, fun to sing. And strange when you remember all the words!!  Wee Hairy Beasties, love the names. Kids loved it and so did I.","7965":"Got this as part of a free music sampler pack for participating in an Amazon survey somewhat recently, and was disappointed by its contents. This was one of them.","7966":"fun","7967":"Really enjoy having this again (it was a cassette the first time I had it.).","7968":"Sounds like a re-recorded version. Should have listened to the sound bite more carefully.","7969":"Used to listen to this garbage...right up to the point a started bringing in big money. Funny how that works..","7970":"This album transported me to a place that I don't normally allow myself to venture.  It is almost \"levitational\" if that is a word.  It is beautiful music and written for a 9\/11 memorial at Trinity Church in Manhattan.  Very worth listening....","7971":"I am not a fan of this version. It has a disco vibe , the other version is better","7972":"I have the whole vinyl lp of this Irene Reid single.......title of lp is \"It's Only The Beginning for Irene Reid\" on MGM !! This is her first solo recording. Anyone interested it's for sale !!!","7973":"Came exactly as it was described THAAANKS","7974":"A more apt title would be romantic  recitations to music. However that having been said the disc is immensely enjoyable. Boyer acts out the lyrics and the orchestra and chorus provide the music. Gigi is an interesting example. In the movie Louis Jordan also spoke the lyrics but in tempo and made one or too attempts to burst into song. Charles just recites and let's the musicians do their magics. If you are a fan of romantic songs,romantic movies and of Boyer I highly recommend the LP or disc.","7975":"I first heard \"Fall into the Sea\" by accident and I found it really interesting.  It's very original and has it's own unique sound.  On a whim one night I went to go see them play and I was completely blown away.  All of their songs are great and I would definitely recommend ordering it.  Every member of Swim is extremely gifted and they put on a great show.","7976":"Perfect for people who enjoy this genre of music! I downloaded this because my boyfriend was looking for it, so I got it for him. :-)","7977":"eh","7978":"I heard this song on the radio, which I rarely listen to (and when I do I don't expect to hear the best music), but I was intrigued by this song. I wondered who this band was, who were their influences, how long they've been around, etc. To my ears I heard 80's and 90's alternative music influence such as The Pixies or even The Cure. I really love this song and their song \"Colours\", and will continue to listen to more of their music to see if I like it as much as this song.","7979":"I don't remember this song, so it probably sucks.","7980":"Haven't lisyened to the whole thing yet but what I have heard so far is great. Sad they broke up.","7981":"Great Song!","7982":"Very creative. A must for reggae lovers.","7983":"The sample is fine, but turning a classic and well-celebrated song into a musical countdown wasn't exactly the best idea. I don't recommend this buy unless it turns out free. :(","7984":"Jamming","7985":"Came quickly and in perfect condition. A must have CD! So glad I found it. I remember listening to it as a little girl.","7986":"cannot download it, cancel and refund","7987":"A great song by one of the best country singers. John Anderson has one of those voices that you want to listen to a lot.  Nice rendition.","7988":"bobby is obviously doing his friend\/pastor? a favor. if bobby would have done the lead vocals, as always it would work, but edd cant sing, god is not served by medeocrity, this is worse. bobby's reputation is tarnished (if possible), and god gets a bad rap (what else is new?) keep on preaching edd, leave the singing to bobby.","7989":"I personally love this song, not sure I could properly explain what grabs me about it, but it's one of my favorites out of all of Laura Marling's music.","7990":"I do not particularly care for this song. Laura Marling's voice is nice, but the song doesn't grab me even when the strength of the music picks up.","7991":"When I first viewed the film I was overcome with emotion.  Many years ago I was engaged to marry a vet of the Vietnam war, and he was in the 1st Cavalry.  His last night his LZ was over run. I learned alot about the war from him.  I was in college 1970 to 1974, and he served his tour in 1969.  What did I know back then?  It was a war everyone was against, but I never took out my feelings about the war on the brave men who had no choice but to serve.  This film is true to life, about the sacrifices the men and their families had to endure. It spoke so true at the end when the narater said, \"...they fought not for their country nor their flag, but for each other.\" I will always remember the devotion Lt. Cornel Hal Moore had for his \"boys\".  I love the scene where his radio operator tells him that they want him out in the morning to report in Saigon.  His words I think I almost know by heart...\"I am in a fight and I object to this order to report to Saigon.  I will not leave my men\"  Diane","7992":"Mike Stand! Yes. Come to AudioFeed Music Festival 7\/2-7\/5 2015 and hear him play a short  set of Altar Boys accoustic and a full set with The Altar Billies. Fun times.","7993":"I LOVE THIS SONG.  It is a nice, romantic song.  Although, I don't agree with the part where he will \"die again\" if she finds another after he passes away, it does remind me of how beautiful true love can be.","7994":"The great goddess Kali's Sahasranamam is very divine and good when played or recited for the household. Removes any evil spirits and promotes well being. Must have in the collection and should be played early morning to remove malefic effects of navagrahas and evil spirits in the air.","7995":"Virtually (1) no response from Apple regarding the unprofessional reproduction download quality  is an even bigger disappointment than the bang and clutter noises heard on this recoding. I have been a faithful Mac owner since 1984 and regret this latest debacle. Hey, it's not a big deal - only .99 cents but Apple's indifference to resolving the problem leaves a very bad taste. To compound the problem I trashed the recording at Apple's request then never heard another word - nothing\n.\n\nRon Nelson\nnelsonlive@comcast.net","7996":"I heard a version of this on YouTube and it was much better than this.........  If I could, half star.","7997":"My personal favorite of the \"Must Have\" series. Peppy with some verve.","7998":"An amazing record by an incredibly talented singer-songwriter. Good things are coming Terra Lightfoot's way. You can bet on it.","7999":"The background music really overpowers the actual voice and ruins the song.  I wil be looking for the original version on the radio.","8000":"authentic and eclectic blues\/folk\/jazz inflected rock music.zeppelin III meets exile on main street in dirty nyc. give it a listen...","8001":"Super nice music","8002":"great","8003":"In starting training for a Fire Department Physical Agility Test I started listening to '50 Workout Cadences'.

I thought they were lost forever  now I know where to get them......thanks","8006":"If you like the movie \"Sunshine\" as much as I do, you already know this moving theme song. The complete soundtrack does the movie justice, but if you only want 1 track to sum it up, this will do the trick.","8007":"If you're looking for the song from the movie Sunshine, or the one used in the background of several commercials, do not buy this one.  They get some of it right, yes, but then there are distracting \"laser\" sounds, and it lacks the depth and emotion of what it should have been.\nGet Adagio in D Minor (2012 Remaster) by John Muprhy.","8008":"I've loved this piece of music since I heard it in the theater, but it's not easy to find. You can't find the soundtrack here at Amazon. iTunes has it, but I believe reviews have said it is only at 128kbps (weird). Also, you have to buy the entire album to get just the one piece of music (weirder), and the producer of this soundtrack thought it would be cool to sprinkle dialogue from the film throughout (weirdest), which I don't find so cool, personally (this isn't a campy Flash Gordon movie).\n\nIf you want only this track, I don't know anywhere to get a better version of it than this, even if it is just a cover.","8009":"Gilbert sucks","8010":"I put this on as I was settling down to sleep thinking it would help me relax. Freaked me out! when I HEARD VOICES haha Have no clue what it's saying to me (which I do not like) and it's like having someone whisper in my ear. I'm just glad it was so cheap. I'll never listen to it again.","8011":"I love Alice Cooper but this album only has a couple of songs worth listening to. I am very disappointed.","8012":"A wonderful, slightly trancy piece of J-tek (Japanese Techno) brilliance.  Would be perfect on a long drive, in a club, in a movie.  Maybe it's just perfect in general.","8013":"Awesome song!","8014":"All of the Sensation albums are great but I would rate this one especially high on value because the MP3 version is sold as a single song for $0.99...you just can't beat the value.","8015":"His early versions of this song are outstanding. This new version shows the deterioration of his voice and is not worth the time to listen to.","8016":"I expected to be led into a rosary meditation on the sorrowful mysteries, but instead of that, heard some dry talks on the ressurection. The rosary itself is recited at lightening speed , each mystery being interrupted by a short talk having nothing to do with the mystery at hand. It was a waste of money since i won't be playing it again.","8017":"Two tracks catch and won't move forward ...and this was purchased NEW!","8018":"Awesome","8019":"There's a reason you haven't heard of this musical before.","8020":"Saw this on Broadway and at one point caught myself starting to doze off. Working only made it to Broadway on the strength of Schwartz's Godspell and Pippin, of which this can't come close to in any way. The score is terrible, amateurish, and completely forgettable. Even the Broadway production felt like a community theater endeavor. It's no wonder it is rarely listed among Stephen Schwartz's many accomplishments. A formidable composer, even his bomb, The Bakers Wife has better music. Actually it has a ravishing score, but a book that can't seem to work.\nEither way if you are expecting anything on a par with Godspell, Pippin, or Wicked..forget it. Working is bad, pure and simple, stay away.","8021":"Don't waste your time or money. This is seriously not going to improve any mental agility or induce you to learn faster.","8022":"Hey great song...really....its like 4th of July, solid lyrics and music....Great song...It also rips into the pop country garbage which doesn't hurt !!!Great song.","8023":"This disk was far from romantic music... to me it was doom & gloom","8024":"Not as good as I expected","8025":"You can tell all the guys in Chickenfoot are having a great time and doing this because they really want to. This is just one of the excellent songs on Chickenfoot 3. Great lyrics, excellent guitar & the bass is amazing.

All of the old folks get down to this too.","8027":"Not what I expected","8028":"Sammy sounds better than ever, good soulful tune. I love this song and the concert version. This thing requires a lot of words.","8029":"Where in the heck did they come from?  I just happened to stumble across them while looking for new music on Amazon and I am now hooked.  So this review isn't just for this album but the Roommate since the sound is similar on each album.  Roommate truly catches a laid back dubstep vibe.  Some songs are so so but mostly they are dope.  You have to check out all of the songs.  I'm looking forward to new material.","8030":"Freddie Mercury was quite a talent...","8031":"Emilie Autumn creates a new genre of music with her unique style and technique of playing the violin.

I just assumed it was all instrumental so imagine my surprise when the dude's voice comes in half way through.  Not for a romantic Karaoke duet!!!!","8037":"So, I did not red the reviews or I would not have purchased this. My son needed the tract for a vocal showcase and imagine our surprise when there was someone singing on it!!! Very misleading and disappointing!","8038":"Why is there a male's voice in this? I had to purchase this before I knew there was a male's voice in this so-called Karaoke","8039":"I also bought this track thinking it was instrumental ONLY and there are male vocals on it. Pretty bummed- hoping I can get a credit back from Amazon.","8040":"OK for 69.\n\nBetween _Greatest Hits_ and _Classic Queen_ are nearly all of Queen's US hits, but I wanted more. \"Flash's Theme AKA Flash,\" a minor (#42) 1981 single, is on neither of these collections, and I seemed to remember it being cool (I was 11 when it came out). So, I picked it up (virtually... you know what I mean) for 69 cents. Turns out my memory was off a bit. This single came out between \"Another One Bites the Dust\" and \"Under Pressure,\" so Queen was still a more-than-going-concern when \"Flash\" was released. Maybe the soundtrack format didn't suit them.","8041":"I thought this would have words on screen but none. I guess maybe I didn't read description or something. Daughter was disappointed cause she's only 7 and wanted the words.","8042":"I am completely satisfied with this purchase. This is exactly what I expected and how I remembered it to be.","8043":"If you are a Queen fan this is a must have album for your collection. It really show the versatility of the group. I wore out an 8 track of it when I was in High School. One of my favorite groups.","8044":"The file is zipped and will not download to my Windows Media Player.","8045":"I should have read more closely. I wanted the actual rascal flats song, not the karaoke version.... I purchased it to go on a windows movie maker video that I was making, and couldn't load the song into the video because of some type of file corruption or incompatibility. So, basically it was a waste of .99 for me....","8046":"What do you need to know? If it wasn't for Flash Gordon the planet Earth would have been destroyed and none of us would be here. This is his theme song. If you still need further convincing it is performed by Queen. Thank you, Flash.","8047":"Music won't play. I am very unhappy.","8048":"I was not pleased to find out I wasted over $1 for a track that was merely 256kbps and was the 2011 rereleased off of the \"Hot Space (Deluxe Edition)\".\nAmazon needs to post the KBPS for tracks in the description, let alone standardize all tracks at a minimum of 320kbps (ideally with the option to buy tracks in a larger format like .WAV or .FLAC)\n\nIn Conclusion:\nGreat Song!  Worth 4 STARS.\nUnfortunately the Quality of the mp3 is only worth 2 STARS.","8049":"I love it! I am a big Disney fanatic and so is my son, so this is perfect for the both of us.","8050":"Lolz! This is too cute! My 3 year old and I played this even AFTER Christmas! Goofy's voice is too funny- sounds just like Mickey Mouse Clubhouse- my toddler is very discerning about his Disney characters and this track passed his inspection  :) It fit the bill nicely!","8051":"Anemic. Probably is the key word. But it probably isn't the best rather the worst.","8052":"Before finding Drew Simpson's magnum opus, Noteworthy, I was lost in life and downtrodden by my lack of smooth, easy listening jazz music.  But after listening to the silky bass and tingling guitar of \"Meet Dr. Washington\" and \"On Fallen Ground\" my world exploded in a kaleidoscope of deep and meaningful love making hallucinations.  Thank you for exposing yourself to me, Drew Simpson, I will be forever changed by it.","8053":"Great songwriting and musicianship.\nThe vocal sound is robotic and eerie...\nThe lyrics are meaningful and tell a story...\nGREAT!","8054":"Might as well be Nickelback... :\/ Not a song I would buy for myself. Might I direct your attention, instead toward a band called Bobaflex!","8055":"You'll need the original script from the original LP of fifty years ago, in order to act out the scenes with Miss Goddard.  Otherwise this download is pretty much pointless.","8056":"I love this so much...and my fans loved the cover I did of it.  Definitely a winner, I'd say.  10\/10.","8057":"When romance is in the air, nothing accentuates it quite like the right music, which, when done properly, has the power to magnify powerful emotions and moods. \"Fall In Love,\" by singer\/songwriter\/producer Ginger Patterson is a ballad that is almost undefinable. Containing both traditional and unconventional elements, it is like a fine, abstract piece of art; everyone who listens to it will hear something different, but it is open to interpretation and there is most definitely something there to appreciate.\n\nThe song begins with an interesting guitar, strings, and a piano melody that sets up the entrance of Ginger's sensual voice. Lyrically strong, \"Fall In Love\" tells of the things that are beautiful about being in love.  Ginger has a range of tones within her voice, and is capable of quickly and smoothly transitioning from a soft breathy sound to a full tone, with a touch of gospel conviction in her delivery, and very solid background harmony on her vocal overdubs. More tasteful keyboard sounds appear on the second verse, along with drums, a tambourine, and clever production ideas with regard to breaks in the phrasing, bringing cool surprises. In music, timing is everything. When you do something is just as important as how, and much thought was given not to overuse a sound just for the sake of doing so. The chords are solid and flow well with the way Ginger arranged her vocals, which are gripping in just the right places, pulling the lyrics and music together in a way that will remind listeners of loves past and present. Ginger has a unique voice and vocal style, but it is one that this listener appreciates.","8058":"This is an outstanding CD with world-class performances by the top brass players in the world.  Well worth every penny!","8059":"It doesn't sound like the radio version. This one is slower and less upbeat. I couldn't listen anymore after 30 secs.","8060":"Poor quality recording","8061":"There are two version, the second of which is the 7 Hz Theta version (look at the album cover to tell the difference).\n\nI was disappointed in the 7HZ Theta version.  There is a low level hum sound halfway through the recording that is annoying and distracting.\n\nGet the regular (non 7Hz Theta) version.  That version is excellent.  I listen to it all the time. I downloaded the regular version for free (well, sort of) because I'm an Amazon Prime member.  I decided to purchase the 7 Hz Theta version because I wanted it in my permanent library.","8062":"Not what I expected.","8063":"I get _____.... I love getting _____ while I drive.\n\nWaste of $0.99","8064":"Another blast from the past that was risque for its time.","8065":"It's not what I thought it was I really don't like this song very much. it's not his best work","8066":"I have used this series for almost five months.  Although Ken Goodman recommends completing one hypnosis session per day, I find that I'm doing all six hynosis sessions within a week.  So, after about five or six weeks of using the sessions is when I really began to see results.  Particularly when it came to procrastination, that was the area I first began to notice change...typically, I've been very good at putting things off to the last minute; however, I began to catch myself saying no, do it now.

Case in point the severely distorted vibraphone from David Samuels, singing like Hendrix.  I transcribed \"Soft Focus\" (tk. 2) with the solo.  He really opened my ears.  The lp includes the stereo mix layout from said song showing the instruments and how they are panned - pretty cool.","8068":"Beautiful voice.","8069":"Do you give up too easily?

Very sloppy A&R work!","8071":"First off, this guy has a big ass \"Pumpkinhead\" shaped skull, so I'm guessing his parents never turned him as a baby. Secondly, who in the fudge puts their ugly a$$ face on an album when they look like this guy? LOL, needless to say, this album is a complete waste of time.","8072":"excellent.  has the classic Regina sound","8073":"Great vocals","8074":"Too bad. I was looking forward to hearing this recording but was disappointed the first 3-4 minutes in. It is advertised as a 'stereo' recording 'live' from the Met. Lots of echo was added to the sound making it more stereo-like but the singers sound far, far away...like within the next city block or so. The orchestra sounds like it is in your lap.\n\nThat's right folks, it was recorded by an audience member with a good seat in the front row. There is a woman who talks almost constantly near-by in a whisper and a man whose annoying coughing is the best sound on the recording. Sometimes he sounds so life-like you want to turn around to see who is standing behind you. It IS October in New York. I love so-called 'live' historic recordings but if there is a limit...this is it.\n\nThe best coughing sound effect record on the market. After the first disc I felt like I knew this gentleman. No repeated listening and off to the used record shop with you! Goodbye Kleiber 'live' and all.","8075":"This album is pure doo doo. This guy has no flow can't rap and is plain stupid. He's like an autistic kid heck an autistic kid is way better. Dangerous B more like Dangerous bad. Save your money and buy something. Anything is better than this.","8076":"This French duo from Lyons brings a polished product to the masses, enticing you to dance with their sexy sound that is well developed for such a young band. It is no surprise that they name Daft Punk and Air as their influences, as this sound is clearly of a Versailles band vintage, despite their slightly different origins.  Some of their riffs and loops remind me of a more dance-oriented version of the XX.  Be sure to check out their music video \"This Night a Soldier\" - which is a song strangely not on this album, yet really awesome.","8077":"Wish it had the other shattered dreams song I heard on youtube instead of that one in album but overall good album...","8078":"Horrible.","8079":"Anyone know where these \"poems\" came from?...Not in any of her works I have!...Maybe Ted Hughes' achives!?..lol..Unfortunately,she sounds like he does here!...If you listen to each one,they all sound the same--as does her voice reading them!...\"Daddy\" should be here!...If you want to experience the \"real Sylvia\" to the max,read this poem,then listen to her read it on YouTube!...\n\nI guess from a historical perspective,having her read these is a good concept,but they all seem flat,and she reads them all the same,making me wonder why it took til now to release this as she's been dead since 1963!","8080":"Also, quality just isn't very good, not that i expected it to be all that great on a recording that old. But still a nice trip down memory lane.","8081":"First off, I will say that this music is not really in my genre (I'm more of an orchestral person), but I will say that these guys do some pretty good music.\n\nIronically enough, they pulled me aside in one of the local malls out here, and asked if I had some time to listen to one of their tracks. Even though I was into a rather obscure musical blend, they still managed to pull out a track that I was instantly drawn to. Now, I could have walked away from there, but instead bought this CD from them in person for $20.00 - All the tracks on the disc kept me listening.\n\nI guess in conclusion - I have to give them 4.5 stars (-.5 because although I like the music, it's still outside of my normal genre), and for providing me with an awesome disc to listen to.\n\n-Lobster","8082":"So many good tunes, wicked man.","8083":"I would give it no stars if they let me. Not just subliminal or ultrasound there was nothing, even according to a oscilloscope, on the MP3. Not just silent but no ultrasound, as claimed, either.","8084":"This is a very different version of the classic song, I recommend it to those who aren't attached to the doris day version.","8085":"I enjoyed listening to this song.","8086":"Social commentary (what else?) from one of my favorite duos, with which I totally agree.","8087":"Did not like it.","8088":"In Edward Teller's wikipedia entry , we see the richness of a SINGLE contributor to the Manhattan Project.\n\nIf the rest of the world UNDERSTOOD what has been hidden and GROWN since the end of WW2 and the two atomic bombings, then they would know better than to mess with us instead of being fools.","8089":"Well, it's free. It has that going for it. But I'm not sure I can muster the musical courage to listen to it again.\n\nThis doesn't sound like the Crosby and Nash of old. It sounds like a political message masquerading as poetry and dubbed with half-hearted guitar.","8090":"David Crosby & Graham Nash still sound great, their hearts are in the right place, the price is right, unfortunately the song...?","8091":"not quite what I expected","8092":"I didn't order this song and when I saw that I had been billed for it I was concerned about my Amazon account being hacked.  No worries Amazon took care of everything.  But still this item came up for me to review.  Well all I can say is I listened to about 10 of the song and the music was horrible as well as the language. It's a poor commentary on our society to know that there are people out there that actually enjoy this music.  Such a shame.","8093":"christmas songs are perfect for my pre-k class. I was able to play them every day from my kindle to keep the kids meery going into Christmas","8094":"I don't recommend downloading ANY music on Kindle. You may OWN the file, but you can't TRANSFER the file. It is in a proprietary format. Enough said.","8095":"I listened to this cd today. One of the best CDS i have heard in some time. I enjoyed this cd very muoh.  From all I am to In My Daughters Eyes to Send in the Clowns every track was great.  I want to hear more from Viktoria.","8096":"Careless love is the best cut.  The musicians are superb.  I have often thought many people do not care for traditional jazz because there are many bad bands out there.  This is as good as any of the greats but these guys are living!!!","8097":"Very good listing","8098":"love","8099":"Great meaningful song!","8100":"Very few people sing this song, and the Phipps sing it as well as anyone I've heard.  This song always puts a pep in my step before I go soulwinning!","8101":"I wish I could provide a more positive review. What a disappointment. These 2 great musicians should work magic together, but the end result missed the mark and is grating.\n\nCmon, guys? Layla is now a blues song? How sad that this great rock anthem is once again trashed, seemingly in the name of commercialization, and once again transformed into a grotesque parody of the original. Next thing you know Layla will be recorded as a marching band song and used in parades??? Or perhaps used for polka dancing classes.","8102":"This recording of Gary Roadarmel alone with just a guitar and a microphone is a breath of fresh air in a world full of over produced music these days. The songs are beautifully constructed and Gary's vocals are right on at the right times and they crack just at the points that need to be there. The guitar licks often sound as if several people are playing. His voice often sounds like a young George Jones or a beer soaked Johhnny Thunders. There are several classic country covers (Tall, Tall Trees, Looking At The World Trough a Windshield and Spotlight.  Gary really hits it on \"Spotlight\" an obscure David Allen Coe tune, With the simple guitar and vocal he truly evokes the theme of \"shoot out the spotlight.\" The best songs on this release are Gary's original tunes, many of which he performed with his previous band Porter Hall, TN.<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/All-Sinners-Welcome-Here\/dp\/B000S9A742\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">All Sinners Welcome Here!<\/a>&nbsp;This time the songs are broken down into the simpliest form and straight to the point, the words display the truth in the stories.

All and all a great find for anyone who loves their music simple, beautiful and a little rough around the edges.","8103":"I would just like to say how sickened I am with this product you are trying to sell for 299.99??? Are you serious?!?! How sick of a person are you to try and rip people off and try to make money off of such a sweet and innocent man? I am disgusted with all these people trying to make money off of his passing. SHAME ON YOU!!! We contain a group of thousands of people who truly care and love this man and his family. We will fight tooth and nail to make sure people like YOU aren't trying to make money off of his passing.","8104":"This is a great compilation with a nice mix of different styles, from funk to blues.  It will definitely get you out of your seat and dancing.  Highly recommended.","8105":"less than 2 minutes long","8106":"Getting this theme was bad thinking on my part,mostly because of the 2 way radio every now and then.","8107":"Does not help with sleep","8108":"Stumbled upon this artist because of my love of Felicia Day. She is in this music video. The song is good but all the Geek refrence in the music video makes it that much better!","8109":"Great","8110":"I still get excited every time I listen to this interpretation of a classic.  Tony and Amy really had their body and soul when they recorded this song.  WOW","8111":"Bad gay bar music","8112":"Rhapsody in Blue is a masterpiece, no question, but this performance does it justice. Beautiful! I can listen to it over and over - and do. My hubby was not a Gershwin fan, but this rendition of \"Blue\" changed his mind. Well done throughout! I highly recommend it.","8113":"THESE  TWO VOICES ARE BLUE VELVET.  J.D. LANG IS AWESOME.  WISH SHE'D RECORD MORE OF THE SONGS MY AGE ENJOYS (80+)  LIKE THAT.\n\nJ.D. LANG IS AWESOME - HER VOICE IS BLUE VELVET.  WISH SHE'D RECORD MORE SONGS MY AGE GROUP (80+) WOULD ENJOY.","8114":"ordered in error","8115":"The performance is fantastic and the original masters of these recordings are of excellent quality, but the mp3s themselves are of a very poor quality indeed. A waste of both time and money even at the bargain price. The Decca issue has the same performance with superior sound quality.","8116":"If you are going to re-make golden oldies, you should at least try to put out a decent rendition. This one was ruined by Gaga's cheap attempts to \"modernize\" the language and Bennet's sycophantic chortles","8117":"These two singers sound perfect together.","8118":"I am a big fan of the drums and this song has such great percussion!!!","8119":"I first heard this CD on a You Tube video and fell in love with it!!!  Great beat!","8120":"OK, if you are looking for a fast pounding beat, this has it... One star... the beat of each song seems to be approximately the same... Two stars... but if you are actually hoping to enjoy the music because you used to enjoyed the original songs... this sounds like scrambled eggs set to a beat... over and over and over and over. There is a law against cruel and unusual punishment and I am not sure what is worse, the loss of what I paid for this migraine inducing montage, or the portion of my life that I lost listening to this and will never recover.","8121":"Cheesy and obnoxious","8122":"It is OK.","8123":"The movie \"The Woman\" ... just about the best female Amazonian cannibal warrior movie you'll ever see. But Wow... the soundtrack couldn't have been more perfect. Music and Lyrics and performance sublime compared to the uber gritty movie. Perfect. And heartbroken that Spillane didn't have a readily available CD to snap up. Downloaded from Amazon with great joy.","8124":"I am an audiophile with a serious music rig and I want don't want the Diet Coke version of this album. I've bought it, because I have no choice, in MP3, but am hoping for a CD release.\n\nOtherwise, man, what an album, more people should be aware of this guy.","8125":"wonderful player....can't go wrong with the Beatles....Tony does wonders with Brazilian music too...I think Brazil will adopt him soon as one of their own.","8126":"IRRITATING AFTER A WHILE! If played low-tolerable! Loud - annoying! Not usable for drowning out outside noise. Okay, for playing in the bathroom to create that nature appeal!","8127":"Great to relax to. Sounds like there is a storm going on. I would recommend to anyone that looking for relaxation sounds.","8128":"it has good music with goods beats and music to work out by.worth using there programs as well. Great site","8129":"it's Tony Bennett and Willie Nelson, what can I say, the song is divine.","8130":"When I enthusiastically purchased this track (I adore Shara Worden) I thought I was getting a full track from a sampler CD, but in fact it is not an error on the track listings for this CD. The actual piece is a truncated 25 second cut from the entire song. Asking $0.99 for it led me to believe that time listing on the site was in error. After all, who in their right mind would offer a 25 second cut from a song for the same price as a full track? Well, obviously, Amazon.com would. That's ridiculous! And since it's a digital download, Amazon has a no return\/refund policy. That sucks given this situation. I feel ripped off. Caveat emptor to the max. Sucks big time for me.","8131":"I love dr. hook","8132":"one of my favorite \"chill\" tunes","8133":"ok","8134":"My group didn't enjoy this. I was expecting more well know artists. I would like to be able to hear music before I purchase.","8135":"i thought this was a bunch of sound effects, not just one.","8136":"It's not the real artist, and doesn't sound close. The original is called Brass In Pocket by Pretenders. My guess the they titled it \"I'm Special\" that don't know the original song name (I was one) in an attempt to deceive people into buying it.","8137":"Its a dated song from a time when \"free love\" was over, but discos, one night stands, etc. caused a lot of artists to sell out to vulgar, songs perfect to dance to while looking to \"mate\". It is disappointing that Rod Stewart was one of artists that number.","8138":"sonds like it was recorded in some ones basement","8139":"One  of my favor songs from the 80's by Soft Cell. It sums up the decade will. Tainted Love, but the music really is well song  in song with a memorial beat, you just can't forget melody as the electric keyboard breaks in with the start of TAINTED LOVE.","8140":"Good sound effect -- worked for me.\nJust wish I could have more than one sound effect for the price.","8141":"No voice. Instrumentals only.","8142":"I think they missed the hot part of this album...and half the piping...\n\nOne thing I go by for bagpipe Christmas music is THE USE OF BAGPIPES...this rarely had it to a point whee I'd recommend it for more than every five years or so in a Christmas music rotation...  I don't really like the pipes being drowned out by any unnecessary instruments (let alone what seemed like full orchestras of them)...just have them front and center and any other musical accompaniment not within the same time zone...iF you can help it...","8143":"Great music with always a great story to go along for all ages and walks of this life we are all blessed with.","8144":"Love the mix of modern sound with ancient melodies. The use of the flute or oboe is reminiscent of Jethro Tull and the harmony is outstanding.","8145":"Nice beat, great song!!","8146":"Excellent","8147":"Good","8148":"I first heard SID drop a short verse on the Snowgoons Black Snow 2.  I really liked his lyrics and flow, he was different than all the other MC's on the track.  So I looked him up and found out that he was in Slipnot.  Awesome, I love Slipnot.  Well.... Here's the warning: This is for one not a rap CD and for two sounds nothing like Slipnot.  However, that would be fine with me I'm always looking for a new sound.  But it wasn't anything like good either.  He sings on almost all tracks and sounds like a drunk guy singing kareokee at a Moose Lodge. I see very little skill or talent in this album.  Maybe the kids get it but I sure don't","8149":"It doesn't download the whole song.","8150":"I RATED IT A 5 BECAUSE HE HAS BECAME MY FAVORITE SINGER. HE NEEDS MORE SONGS ON HERE WOULD BUY THEM.","8151":"The City tape was recorded over half way through side A, this still did not sit well with me. I have been a good Amazon customer and should be treated in a better manner.","8152":"great song at a great price","8153":"This is NOT Lou Grahm on vocals have no clue who it is , clearly not the original from the 70's","8154":"Perfect","8155":"This song as well as the dong \" Aladdin's Lamp are an absolute MUST for any Gene Pitney fan.. Both are very Rare from the late 60's","8156":"Great song!","8157":"the best","8158":"song wouldn't burn to CD","8159":"I love this song...Gene Pitney had such a unique voice...","8160":"First of all, I'd like to thank Amazon for making this recording available as downloadable Mp3's. At the moment (9\/6\/15), this CD is not available, but the disc with both Beach Boys Songbooks can be had for $466-!400.00. In other words, essentially unavailable. I've noticed that Amazon is beginning to do this with other out of print CD's, usually 60's catalog, and I can only encourage them to do more of this because there is an audience out there for these titles if they're not $100.\n\nThe Hollyridge Strings were actually a rather radical idea for their day. Until they put out The Beatles Songbook in June, 1964, teen-pop, the music of Top 40 Radio, was generally considered off-limits for an easy listening instrumental treatment. You didn't here orchestral arrangements of the hits of Fabian, Dion and the Belmonts or the Everly Brothers on the radio or in restaurants and offices. Those songs were kids' songs and the whole genre of rock'n'roll was considered musically worthless. Then came the Beatles and that changed everything. By March, 1965 Time Magazine ran a cover story on the pop\/rock scene, by Autumn, 1965 the Beatles would record Yesterday with a string quartet and get airplay on \"Adult\" stations and by 1967 Leonard Bernstein would be praising pop on a network TV special.\n\nBut this was in 1964, long before all that, when the idea of orchestral arrangements of Beatles and Beach Boys songs must have seemed like a crazy idea. The project may have been just Capitol Records (who were the Beatles U.S. label) way of further jumping on the Beatlemania Bandwagon as everybody else was trying to do, or it may have been a creative person at Capitol recognizing the melodious sound of the Beatles songs and how it would easily transpose. The work in any case fell to Stu Phillips, a noted composer-arranger whether or not it was his original idea. He was a graduate of the Eastman School of Music who had made easy listening albums for Capitol under his own name, and for Colpix Records produced hit songs Johnny Angel (Shelly Fabares), My Dad (Paul Peterson), Blue Moon (Marcels) and Goodbye Cruel World (James Darren). It was this familiarity with contemporary pop that gave him the ability to orchestrate it without losing its vitality.\n\nThe Beach Boys Songbook was the second release by the Hollyridge Strings who, of course, were whatever studio orchestra musicians Capitol had at the time, and it came out in the Fall of 1964. The sound of the orchestra is very transparent (helped by excellent remastering here), with the strings accompanied by horns, trumpets, flutes and extensive use of piano. As you'd expect, songs like Don't Worry Baby and In My Room lend themselves easily to this treatment, and She knows Me Too Well is a particular standout with its elaborate piano part. But the more rocking songs come out intact with all their punch, even Surfin' USA and I Get Around, which boldly leads off the album. This is no sleepy Mantovani strings oversaturating the tunes but an authentically creative reimagining of Brian Wilson's melodies that retains their spirit.\n\nThis album got as much play from me as the actual Beach Boys albums in late 1964 (note because Capitol also had the Beach Boys a tune like Wendy which was on the Top 40 when this album was released was able to be included). Stu Phillips went on to compose many movie scores and television themes and is noted for his music for Battlestar Gallactica.","8161":"The preview is deceptive.  After you order and you play the song, you will notice this isn't the original recording within the first second into the song.  If you haven't followed Foreigner then you may like this version.  I wasted $0.69 on this...bummer.","8162":"I thought this would be the track I was used to from another Foreigner CD (can't remember which).  This version does not communicate the power and emotion that the original did.  Wish I had known.","8163":"The song Pass At Me (feat. Pitbull) by Timbaland is an exhilarating song that appears to be about the singer andor singers basically saying that they love when particular women aggressively go after them\/take the initiative in pursuing them. The song also appears to be a bold take on the singers enjoying how some women have a good time in the dance clubs andor Im guessing any type of social clubs\/gatherings\/parties.","8164":"This reminded me of some old school EazyE, but it wasn't as good. Lyrics are just about getting money and beats have been done before. Not a fan.","8165":"One of the many great Bobby Vee songs!","8166":"Everyone needs to listen to Nirvana! My 3 year old girl was in the truck with me when I was listening to \" Something in the Way \"  and she sings it in her sleep almost!","8167":"Stu Phillips arrangements unforgettable","8168":"Joseph Vincent writes pretty good songs and this is no less than what he has written before. Definitely the song has the theme of bumblebee.","8169":"I like this woman, I like her looks, her voice and her philosophy on life. This song will be the song my daughter and I will dance to on her wedding day.","8170":"Esta cantante grita mucho!","8171":"This is a great version, has a bit of grit & rawness to it.  The Vig Nevermind is so clean & polished.","8172":"One of the rarest They Might Be Giants songs out there, the first time I heard it was on the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers the Movie soundtrack, but only briefly, then suddenly, Amazon had it for download, much to my joy! Highly recommended for any TMBG fan out there :D","8173":"This album is awesome!  If you love Freedom and America, you have to pick up this album!  The title track, \"American Rifle\" is one of the best written songs that I know and it truly expresses how many of us in this country feel about freedom and the price of freedom that has been paid throughout history.","8174":"This is ok but i would suggest buying only a few of these mp3s separately you aren't missing anything money money every where and many 2 or 3 more including the affirmations track.\ni think maybe this wasn't what i thought it would be this si about providing good service to your customers, i lack appropriate opportunities so maybe i should search for that\nbut ive ran into this problem before with her albums but i still was able to grow and still received something positive out of it\nok i am editing my review 4\/27\/16 from four stars to 2 (being nice)\nok heres why i will not purchase her mp3 again.\neven though there were aspects of this mp3 i did not like i still used it. i noticed my attitude twords other people changed, i started getting more of a \"kanye west\" syndrome and believe that i shouldn't have to work for my success (as suggested in this mp3)  i actually shouldntve bought the whole cd.\nbut what i will say on a positive bullet is that i care less about others and feel as though people should pay me regardless ... i was actually raised to be the best i can be and its very hard and immoral to do some of the things suggested here.\nhonestly im not in a situation to \"pick and choose\" things often. so to pick and choose things based on \"quality\" is not a healthy option. i think this mp3 should have been more well thought out as everyone's situations are different. though it has given me courage to do things that needed to be done in a less than merciful way. what hurts the most is the acknowledgement of people who do not work hard who achieve massive success. i think this made my situation worse and more depressing if anything. i mean obviously a person buying this self help mp3 works hard and deserves more money however suggesting to be like those just born lucky is a hard pill to swallow im sorry.\nive worked hard my whole life and all it did was bring to light that i am NOT wealthy as i should be. as in my previous reveiw i would suggest to purchase money money everywhere. the othe mp3s are for people who probably do not work hard and ARE poor. oh and the other one about having a roommate who doesnt clean up after them selves is good. but i would never recommend this to a loved one as a whole mp3\/cd just those 2. i found a similar mp3 by hypnosis live which says what she say but in a shorter yet more GRACEFUL way.\nwhat anna thompson usually does are audio shamanic journeys. i think if your into that you will probably buy her mp3s but the problem is trusting what she is saying. so in conclusion the only thing positive that happend is me firing people who i should have fired along time ago.\nall of the other results im not comfortable with oh yeah & one of those is starting accounts one to save and one to give away... um i stopped being as generous a long time ago because i honestly do not have the money to be donating to charities & i subconsciously had been giving me thinking \"oh it will come back\" after i realized why i stopped giving so much..its cuz I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY! i noticed after i realized i had less money. it makes me look like im rich to other people who probably want to use me though i don't know how great that is.\nim glad i could do it in the future but right now i really need all of my money and can not afford to be Ms generosity all of the time people should be generous to me more often ijs cuz i really aint got it like that.\ni think her intentions are good but for something like this i would suggest something more customized.","8175":"I could not play it on my professional system.

It includs many melodies from different countries:from russian to spanish, hungarian, italian, gypsie,oriental, and so on...\nA pianist is also very good and givs certain character and rithm to each melody.

In Yellow Beads they nearly talk through the song, as if imparting some special and essential secret knowledge that only they were privileged to, suggesting in a creepy manner as to what was necessary if one was considering heading out onto the hippy highway headed west into the sun  through truth be told, the counter culture daze of San Francisco nights was already splintering and crashing to the ground in a haze of hard drugs and unpleasantness.\n\nWithout hesitation, it should be understood that this was commercialism at its finest and most blatant, offering nothing of value, because these two were never part of the times from which they pretended to be.  Oddly enough Fowler and Woolery did manage to make the big time, with Fowler doing session guitar work for both Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen, and Woolery becoming the eternal television gameshow host.\n\nHappily this duo, and these songs, have been lost to space and time, surfacing only in odd collections that one nearly happens upon, making me to this very day feel damaged, taken advantage of, ripped off if you will, that tracks such as these would ever be considered as anything less than disingenuous.  But, time has an odd specter to it, wherein a spinning galaxy brings all things back full circle  causing me wonder how many lightyears it will be before the worlds Oh Wow slip through the parted lips some cute blonde in bellbottom hip-hugger pants as she hears these songs for the first time, thinking shes discovered a touchstone, a piece of the holy grail, or the X on a treasure map that never existed.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","8185":"I always thought of Nishizaki as a pop- classical not very serious player.

This band is so good.  I was literally hypnotised with how great she sings.  This song is only one of the many great ones they have out.  Shelter is another great song by them.  Worth every penny.  A must have in your music collection.","8191":"I actually give it no stars because I can't access it!!!!!!Where did it go??????????\nHelp......Even our I T dude can't find it.  I may never download music again.","8192":"I totaly missed that this was a cover!  So upset that I got this. Amazon MP3 fooled me!  I also have a horible version of Turn Up the Music.","8193":"The title on this is confusing, but it does NOT have Usher on it.

And the song has a mournful quality about it. Not everyone would appreciate this type of song.","8221":"Got this as part of a free music sampler pack for participating in an Amazon survey somewhat recently, and was disappointed by its contents. This was one of them.","8222":"This terrific piece of sacred music is a wonder to listen to over and over again.  Another good representation of German composers in this genre.","8223":"Please don't get me wrong - Agostino Steffani's music is wonderful. It's just this performance and recording that are awful, and I already described the reasons why in a 2009 review under Amazon's other entry for this recording:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Alarico\/dp\/B001U1L9ZI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Alarico<\/a>. However, I've been prompted to take a fresh look at it, and of course to do some more listening, after the sudden recent appearance of two glowing five-star reviews, appearing on both this and the other product page (although in the latter case, I see, they have both been deleted again at the same time today, February 18th 2015), praising this recording in similar and very fulsome terms.\n\nThose two reviews were posted by reviewers Magda Levi and Yoav Rothberger, both gilding the lily by adding admiring comments on each other's work. (Stop press: since reading the rest of this, they've now changed their Amazon names to 'ML' and 'A Customer' respectively. Hang on - now they've both deleted their reviews on this page as well, and all their other Amazon reviews!) I'll avoid commenting on the details of the latter's review directly - firstly because, apart from the last paragraph, all the rest has been copied word for word from an entry by Bruno Belli on the website of Luca Casagrande, director and singer in this recording, so there isn't really anything plausible or significant by Mr. Rothberger himself to comment on. Secondly, that reviewer evidently doesn't take kindly to anyone expressing an opinion different from his own, but prefers to resort to ill-mannered language and personal insults to try to prove his point - as could be seen from the comments after the first review I wrote, again on the other product page cited above, although he has since deleted those comments. And thirdly, Mr. Rothberger appears to have a small claque of baroque music enthusiasts at his disposal, who are happy to vote in support of all his comments and to class as unhelpful any comments by anybody else - all, as if by magic, within just a few minutes of the comments being posted. Perhaps a similar fate awaits the present review!\n\nThis leaves me with Magda Levi's review, which contains substantial passages copied word for word, without any acknowledgment, from Chapter 8 of Professor Colin Timms' monograph&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Polymath-of-the-Baroque-Agostino-Steffani-and-His-Music\/dp\/0195154738\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Polymath of the Baroque: Agostino Steffani and His Music<\/a>&nbsp;- from the section entitled `Music and drama in `Alarico il Baltha' '. Ms Levi also has connections with Luca Casagrande's website, having recently contributed some material to it. However, Ms Levi does also add some points of her own to her `Alarico' review here on Amazon, so I will address some of these. In particular, she singles out a number of the singers for fulsome praise - several of whom, to my ears, sound absolutely dreadful and sing wildly out of tune. In my previous review, I tried to avoid causing too much offense by not naming the worst singers individually, and I will repeat that concession here - except in the case of Luca Casagrande, who directs the ensemble and also sings the important baritone role of Pisone. He sings frequently and painfully out of tune, and must also take overall responsibility for this mostly awful performance and recording.\n\nReviewer Ms Levi also makes the point that this was a young cast of singers, around 30 to 35 years of age. Perhaps this is with a view to our making allowances for their youth or inexperience; but are we really expected to make such extreme allowances when we pay out the substantial cost of a three-disc opera set? Besides, I would say that if they can't sing in tune - or at all - by that age then they're unlikely to get much better over the next 35 years.\n\nThis recording has a few assets - for example, the able and stylish playing by the instrumentalists of the Scarlatti Camera Ensemble, and the singing of such as mezzo Lee Ji-Young (Honorio) and soprano Won Mi-Jung Capilupi (Placidia); bass Marco Democratico (Lidoro) is not too bad either, at least having a decent voice if not great style. The greatest asset of all, of course, is Steffani's music, and I'd greatly love to hear it in a decent recording. But here, I'm sorry to say, much of it is ruined by the poor singing and close, harsh, wiry recorded sound. To take just a couple of examples, Stilicone's beautiful chaconne-based aria in Act 1, Scene 15, `Gelosia, lasciami in pace' is wrecked by poor singing and dreadful sound quality; and the lovely duet between Semiamira and Stilicone in Act 3 Scene 3, `Care Fiamme\/ Amate Catene', is ruined by the same factors.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that Steffani's roles intended for male altos are sung here by mezzo and contralto - a practice praised by some reviewers and criticised by others. In fact there appears to be a small but persistent lobby, noticeable among certain reviewers both here and on the Italian Amazon website, who are firmly prejudiced against the countertenor voice and on that basis attempt to discredit the work of great singers such as Philippe Jaroussky and Claudio Cavina.\n\nReturning to the main business, however, the principal drawbacks of the present recording are dreadful singing, terrible recorded sound and the absence of any sense of involvement, drama or cohesion. And, if there were any argument at all for scoring it with a second star - which in my view there isn't - I'd immediately take one star off again for dodgy practices. If musicians seek public approval for their work, they would do much better to come up with a few decent performances and recordings, rather than produce something like this effort and then try to get their supporters to rig the reviews. Most of us here on Amazon, whether readers or reviewers, are not that stupid.","8224":"this song gets stuck in our head all the time. id say its great purchase and worth every penny. perfect, just don't watch the video unless its them singing live lol","8225":"I'm from the Kalamazoo\/ Battle Creek area here in Southwestern Michigan and have had the privelege of seeing \"Pound and Beers\" on numerous occasions. I have been a guitar student of Joe's, and am absolutely astounded by this band's abilty to play their instruments in such an emotional way and make such beautiful music. I highly recommend \"Pound and Beers\" to anyone who enjoys great music that may just touch your soul!! A real, honest, and feel-good band, these guys are awesome! Keep up the great work guys, and I can't wait to hear the next album!!","8226":"Necessary on my Worhip playlist. Period.","8227":"Necessary on my Worhip playlist. Period.","8228":"Disappointed. Was not what I thought it was. Not using it.","8229":"It says workout... All it is, is a CD of oldies music... and not that many.","8230":"Most cds have like 4 songs that I like. This album blew me away. I love almost every single song!","8231":"Solid","8232":"Excellent music!","8233":"... it's the song at the end, not the theme song from the beginning.  I wish I could find the original song, but all the ones available are too slow, or are the wrong song, like this one.","8234":"I just now opened this, and it contains the wrong CD.  It was one by REO Speedwagon.  Probably too late to do anything about it, but thought I should make note of it.  Not happy.","8235":"this is misrepresented you think you are getting original songs even the name of the group doing the songs leads you to believe the songs are by the original artist....very misleading. it was a MP-3 download and i should be refunded for this and you should label it \"Not the original artist\"","8236":"The songs are good but they are not by the orgianal artist. I cant use this at all. I don't bought two albums like this. Modern Country Heros is the other rip off. They should say not orignal artist on package.","8237":"Dvd won't play with US DVD player.","8238":"Sound quality is very poor.","8239":"Seems like anything Juan Carlos Lozano makes is pure ear candy. This album sounds somewhat different to his past albums with the band Morbo, but he still manages to create beautiful soothing sounds and catchy hooks. The tempo of the songs is also slower and the lyrics more personal, never intending to possibly land any hits on the charts and therefore the production is noticeably crafted with care. Because he will always be linked to the band that brought him to the spotlight, Moenia, it is fair to compare this production with his fellow former band member Alfonso Pichardo, whose solo release went unnoticed but it was due to being hardly an effort or anything novel. That isn't the case with \"Nada Haces Por Mi.\" Repeat listens will be required but simply because it is very enjoyable album.","8240":"Great CD.A lot of country favorites from each decade Really enjoy.","8241":"Lay off the drugs. Very strange cd. only a few good songs, and i love Hank III, seen him 6 times, but this cd is a waste of money.","8242":"A clever concept fr a song name in itself doesn't make a good song. I give this Heiko Von Schriesheim effort two stars because personally I thought it was boring.","8243":"Ok, I am a huge Hank III fan but this new \"3 Bar Ranch - Cattle Callin\" is HORRIBLE!!! All it is, is very sloppy metal on top of auctioneers. It's a new genera that he calls \"cattle core\", and I have a feeling that this will be the only \"cattle core\" album ever recorded, in fact I hope it is. It's pure dissonant noise, and very hard to listen to. If your planning on picking up one of the 3 of Hank III's new releases, I assure you, this is not the one, IT IS HORRIBLE!!! I'm sorry Hank, I love you and won't ever stop listening to you, but what the hell is this? This is the kind of crap you should have given CURB, not the fans.","8244":"Bought this because it's the closing track in Princess Jellyfish.  It wasn't available last time I looked for it, so I was super happy to see it when I was trolling Amazon for anime themes last night.\n\nThere's another version available, too (listing the artist as \"Team Akihabara\").  That version is 1:54, while this one is just over 3:40.  (I bought both.)  This one seems to be the full-length track while the other seems to be the cut version that runs into and during the Princess Jellyfish closing credits.  (At least, I'm pretty sure that's the difference.  According to YouTube, the runtime on the closing credits is around 1:30, and that's *without* about 25-30 seconds of the \"Love is coming back\" bit and the musical lead-in to the primary lyrics. And btw, both versions include the intro.)  While this particular compilation credits the composer\/arranger (Yamaguchi Takashi), it doesn't credit the artist, which Google tells me is Sambomaster.\n\nSuch a cute song!  (And a cute show, too.)","8245":"I thought it was going to be the whole song, but it was only the chorus","8246":"My kid loves it.  That's all you can ask for.  If she is happy, and hence not whining or crying, then I'm happy.  Good job song about thingamajigs.","8247":"Can't add much more than the headline, my almost 3 year old loves the show and the music, great buy.","8248":"It's a great interpretation with the Barenaked Ladies! So glad I can just buy it as a single. Thank you Amazon.","8249":"The only way I can describe it - If Jesus were in a symphonic metal band, it would probably sound something like this...\n\nMind...BLOWN...\n\n;-)","8250":"My daughters love this band.  Most of their music is pretty tolerable and harmless for adults too.  The show is a little corny.","8251":"My kids love this song! I have to say, for me it's almost a guilty pleasure. I have it on my iPod right along with my Katy Perry and Coldplay songs. It feels like a real pop tune. It's my favorite Fresh Beat song yet... Hope they do an album one of these days!","8252":"This is not the 5446 that you're looking for.  It's not really very good.  Sublime did a version that's better, although it's part of a medley track - Gold Album, Disk 1.  The best one that I've heard is \"54-46 Was My Number\" by Toots, featuring Jeff Beck - you can find it on \"The Best of Guitar Masters\" album.\n\nThis Vanilla Ice track is sort of flat, and lacking passion, for lack of a better word.","8253":"My daughter loves this song. It's fast and fun and you can dance to it! Not to mention she loves the princesses.","8254":"I love this music. The alto sax and the guitar player all were excellent on this cd.","8255":"Too often now a days jazz is associated with elevator music. Well, this ain't elevator music. It's Everyday Magic, the second album from Nashville native, Rahsaan Barber\n\nWhat's more, this album was recorded in Nashville - Music City USA. Nashville may be forever associated with country music, but, let me tell you, they have some cats down there that can blow. The band, also called Everyday Magic, is composed of Barber on tenor, alto and soprano sax as well as flute. Adam Agati on guitar, pianist Jody Nardone, Jerry Navarro on bass (and what a tasty bottom end he plays) and Nioshi Jackson on the skins. Rahsaan's twin brother, Roland Barber is on trombone on two hot tracks, as is percussionist Giovanni Rodriguez.  The album is released on Rahsaan's newly formed Jazz Music City label.\n\nThe album is laid out to display Rahsaan's virtuosity on all the saxes and flute, as well as his various influences. It opens with a bopping tenor show case tune, \"Jubilee\".The first thing that becomes apparent is Rahsaan's articulation on whatever instrument he features. It matters not how fast the tune, the clarity of the notes are amazing. This tune just grooves and brings back memories of John Coltrane or Kenny Garret.\n\nfrom there, Rahsaan and the band cover the whole spectrum a jazz influences, Bop, Avant Garde, Gospel, Blues. Perhaps my favorite tune on the whole album is \"Why So Blue\", an in-your-face blues romp that'll make you think of Stanley Turrentine. Twin brother, Roland Barber is featured on some fine trombone work where he seems to be echoing Rahsaan's gritty tenor. Great work, family style.\n\nAnother highlight is, \"Innocence\", featuring soprano sax work that continues to show of Rahsaan's mastery of the different saxophones. The drummer, Nioshi Jackson,  lays down an infectious stutter-step solo and the interplay between the sax and the guitar is just killer. Close your eyes, and you can see a couple of kids playing in a spring garden. In \"Adagio\", Rahsaan finally shows off his flute work. As the title suggests, this is a sweet, quiet, slow tune. Rahsaan says it was composed on a dare to create a meditative spa kind of music. The album closes out with \"Memphis Soul\", a tight, electronic groove featuring percussionist Giovanni Rodriguez of the Latin-jazz septet, El Movimeinto which is co-lead by Rahsaan.\n\nThis is a great debut for the label and a more than fine sophomore effort from Rahsaan and Everyday Magic.  It may not be elevator music, but it is going nowhere but up.","8256":"The songs on this humorous album are well-written, the singers are talented, and the humor is great! I especially love the song \"I Hate 'Em Waltz\" with the lyrics, \"I hate cleaning the toilet and the never-ending dusting. Oh, I hate mustard, when you squeeze it and all that comes out is some watery stuff...it looks totally disgusting.\" Anyone who drives a car will appreciate the cathartic confessions in the \"Road Rage Polka,\" and the \"BeatBox Polka\" inventively mixes generational styles. The songs truly lighten the spirit and use humor to put all of \"life's little aggravations\" into perspective. The songs also are so catchy that you will find yourself singing them to yourself throughout the day.","8257":"such a good feel heartwarming song one of my favorites on the album.  we've all felt this way at some point!","8258":"I love this song because it talks about vulnerabilities, and I think that's something that everyone can relate to. Beautiful song, with beautiful vocals.","8259":"Lightweight is a pretty song. This song reminds me of Demi a lot. It's about a girl who never really had anyone to rely on but now she does and is scared to trust that person. She's asking the person to be gentle with her because she delicate. Beautiful job well done!","8260":"This song is a song EVERY girl can relate to. A bunch of girls see this guy and they are like who is he? He's hot, he's got amazing eyes and one girl wants him all to her self. Dev and Demi sound just a like. Dev's rap is so catchy. Excellent song!","8261":"Cannot download and have asked for assistance, gotten none and repeatedly bou g ht this song over five times for download purpose which has not worked.","8262":"Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great.","8263":"The original LP with the full title The Wanderin' Five, The Appalacians And Their Friends - Hootenanny At The Limelight In The Village was recorded in 1963 and came out as Somerset SP-19900. The contents of the original LP are: Old Greenback Dollar; Midnight Special; Black Eyed Susie; Turtle Dove; Lonesome Valley; I'll Not Marry At All; The Rovin Gambler; The Riddle Song; Mary, Don't You Weep; Who's Gonna Be Your Man?; Cindy. This collection, using the same original cover, expands to 56 sides by bringing in a host of other artists and, as noted by two other reviewers, offers terrible mp. 3 versions in terms of sound quality.","8264":"Had the LP years ago.  Wanted mp3 of some of the songs.  These tracks are terrible, one of the stereo tracks is missing or greatly decrease.  You cannot hear half or more of the song.  Wish I had not wasted my money.","8265":"This sound horrible at best !!! Songs have multiple skips and instruments are missing!!! Nothing but background music at times !!! The editor must have terrible taste in music !!! I regret buying this !!!","8266":"This is a great CD for anyone who loves kirtan and for anyone who's new to the genre.","8267":"Not actually singing or songs. A lot of La, la, la, la. Didn't keep the album.","8268":"Deep powerful soulful moving richly enjoyable. I recommend it. The more you listen the more it will move you in a good way.","8269":"I didn't like this at all.  I felt it was a waste of time and money.  I wouldn't recommend it.","8270":"I was able to get the whole album for $4, so how could I say no? By the way, Demi Lovato has a lovely voice and is not to be discredited. HOWEVER, I did buy it mainly for the Iyaz song that I put on my Wish List months earlier.\n\nI listen to it, then I click repeat. Bass is thumping, very upbeat...just buy it.","8271":"My new favorite","8272":"Terrific macho song with big classic Hans Zimmer horns and strings!","8273":"this is music which brings memory of distant past from childhood","8274":"Perfect","8275":"Although Chris is left handed and plays the guitar up-side-down, he adds a new and exciting dimension to his other gift, computer sound engineering. He gives the listener a new guitar and voice sound not heard since the first recordings of Les Paul, the inventor of multi-track guitar recording.  This is one amazing recording!","8276":"Exactly what a good dub is... a complete reworking of the original mix without going overboard! If you are adventurous and will admit you like the Murk vocal, but don't want to sing with the Spice Girls, this dub is a perfect answer.","8277":"\"Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying\" is not a typical replica cover.  The tempo and haunting harmony are appropriate to the lyrics.  It scans as a lament, while the original, a great version, sounds almost like a ditty by comparison.","8278":"People like what they like, everyone likes different music.\n\nThe fact that I like this has nothing to do with anyone else liking it.","8279":"Became a fan of this artist when I started going to assemblys of God Church It creates so much peace in my home I am alway happy and wake up at peace my bed is a hard wood floor with a pillow and  blanket so never thought I would be so peaceful when just about everyone would be a grouch from the hard floor","8280":"I Love It","8281":"The Word of Yah is a continuous flow of nourishment to the very marrow and fiber of creation. He spoke everything into existence,\nHe is the Living Water.","8282":"great reworking of this song, husband purchased after hearing on the radio. a soothing & relaxing tune to chill out to","8283":"Lamb of God by Marty Goetz is a great song that is very moving, both in the music and in the lyrics.  It is one of our favorites to use for worship dance, and the choreography I learned is simple to teach to others.  It is the most requested song when we share Hebraic worship with Christians.  You can't go wrong with this song--or the full album!  (written by Darryl's wife)","8284":"Without any reservations, it is easy for me to say that Electric Six is among the greatest bands in existence. Considering the phenomenal catalog of work perfected by this group, \"Heartbeats and Brainwaves\" is indeed the pinnacle of their lyrical and musical domination. Now, each of their albums is brilliant, but this one qualifies as an experimental masterpiece. Electric Six are sonic pioneers; they are loud pilgrims who set sail on the sea of American cheese in search of musical freedom to offer you the best songs instruments can make.\nMy greatest regret is that I didn't have the cash to hire Electric Six to play at my wedding, as there is no music more romantic and intimate as this. When the E6 van approaches your city, seek out tickets to the show, say hello (I see you!), buy some colored vinyl, play frisbee with Dick and realize you are now part of classic rock history.","8285":"NOTE: I do not own this album.\n\nI just listened to the audio sample and it was so bad that it motivated me to write this review. I am a Hindu and am originally from India. Period. The computer generated voice makes the words almost incoherent and difficult to understand. Moreover, Perry Katy sounds  Katy Perry in reverse doesn't it?","8286":"a beautful song well done by alain morisod...","8287":"This was that song when I forgot to shut off the radio, woke up in the middle of the night thinking: What a beautiful version of the song.

A total waste of studio time. Great for torturing terrorists into talking. No waterboarding needed. But waterboarding would be more humane.","8292":"This is the same CD as Lullaby Versions of Duran Duran by Twinkle Twinkle Little Rock Star. Identical recordings, same track order. The only difference is the name of the CD and the name of the band. Both are produced by Roma Music Group. I collect Duran, but really regret buying the disc at full retail price. Make sure you're only buying it for the packaging if you already own the Lullaby version. Feeling kind of ripped off.","8293":"For some reason I received the wrong music on the right disc with the right cover. When I ripped it, it came up as Twinkle Twinkle Little Rock Star  Lullaby Versions of Metallica. And I cant get a hold of anyone to tell them.","8294":"Though I went ahead and ordered this CD, it has the same song selections as \"Lullaby Versions of Grateful Dead\", by Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.  Both are produced by Roma Music Group.  It may turn out to be the same content packaged under two different products.","8295":"(Reviewing original vinyl release - can't speak for mp3 quality)\n\nAnother \"Planet Rock\" it ain't, but it comes close especially on \"Zulu Groove\".  There's a lot of the same Bambaatesque sound, but mostly a lot of bass and cowbell, synth and actual horns, and gogo flavor.  I think some of these songs were on Beat Street, or have the same sound.  Uptempo and positive, with intricately layered yet cohesive beats.\n\nLooks like this was finally released in a digital form in 2011 - can't believe this never had a CD!  I hope that helps it reaches more a widespread discovery.","8296":"I had lost track of Willie Nile after his first couple of albums, recorded for Arista Records. 30 some years ago.  I was vaguely aware that he was still around and continued to work, but had paid no attention.  A neighbor of mind recommended his recent work and I listened (and then immediately bought) this album as well as House of a Thousand Guitars  and Streets of New York.\n\nThese are all absolutely terrific albums!  Well-written songs, tending to the anthemic, and well played and arranged.  If anything Willie's music is better today than when he was starting out.  That's a real rarity","8297":"Very good CD. No disappointment here. I enjoy listening to this artist. First discovered him on \"Streets of New York\", now I have three of his releases.","8298":"Very impressive album by the veteran rocker. I liked this one even more than his \"Streets of New York,\" which was also a solid set of songs. You can throw out names like Sprinsteen, Ian Hunter, and Nils Lofgen, and Willie Nile shares that same never-say-die rock & roll spirit. Not sure if the youngsters will dig these tunes, but for those of us that grew up in the 60s and 70s, this music really resonates.","8299":"great","8300":"I know he's not alive anymore. But if he was, I'd say to Lou Reed, \"How dare you write such a song with such a tame sound about doing anything on the 'wild side'. The lyrics may have been controversial, but that doesn't offset the tame sound in my opinion. If I want to listen to a song about doing anything on the wild side, I'll stick to Motley Crue's song.","8301":"This song will not download onto my phone.  I only have access to it through Amazon Music, so I can't even put it on a playlist.  What a rip off!!!!","8302":"This was a big help to my voice students.","8303":"This song is so beautiful!

Say Yes to GOD and no to the world and its ways.","8307":"The first time I heard this song I almost cried. The second time I replayed it, I definitely did. Bart Millard does an amazing job in conveying Moses' internal struggle with God dealing with his role as a leader of the Jewish people to set them free from the tyranny of the Pharaoh.  Even though the song specifically portrays Moses' perspective during and before the Exodus, his insecure and confused state of mind is very relevant to anyone who struggles to see God and His love and affirmation for everyone despite our unworthiness. Really love this song!!!!","8308":"Love this song, I always buy my music here on amazon, the cloud player lets me take it anywhere, and I even have some purchases here from CD's I bought 7 years ago!! and the digital tracks just automatically updated to my amazon cloud player! awesome!","8309":"This song is much slower than I remembered.","8310":"This song is one of the most significant modern songs about Jesus.  It makes one understand the kindness of Jesus and the power of forgiveness.  And they chose the perfect singer, Steven Curtis Chapman.  He knows the intensity of forgiveness first hand.

Damian Marley, Joss Stone, Mick Jagger, David Stewart, and A. R. Rahman!! What an amazing mix! Reggae-Rock-Soul-Indian supergroup!!!","8315":"It's difficult to judge this effort.  The lyrics appear interesting and \"on topic\" for the genre, but the audio mixing and mastering gets a failing grade.  Very \"muddy\" sound.  Please turn off the harmonizers, it will help.","8316":"Amazing, truly AMAZING!!!","8317":"absolutely love Celine Dion's singing, but this oine isn't good at all in my opinion.","8318":"Wrong song","8319":"One of my favorites.","8320":"A good representation of the Pop music genre of the 70's.","8321":"ANyone that believes in God will enjoy and cherish this song, listen to the words.  I would like to purchase more and give to my friends","8322":"My fave white boy band!!! This song is only one of the reasons why. They epitomize their time and genre perfectly and could serenade me anytime.","8323":"OUTRA GRANDE INDICAO PARA O ESTILO ROCK ALTERNATIVO.  UM GRANDE CD DESSE ESTILO.","8324":"Until Tony MacAlpine was forced to form a hair rock ensemble in late 1990, the disparity between 1988's \"Children\" and 1990's \"Carved In Sand\" represented the single biggest drop off in quality between consecutive albums in the history of recorded music.  True, \"Children\" was an aberration - great music, good lyrics, perfect order, outstanding mix, lush orchestrations and tons of vision.  Never before had The Mission risen to that level and, sadly, never would they approach it again.  \"Carved In Sand\" has none of the aforementioned elements.  The titles alone betray the lack of ideas.  When your opener is inspired by an ABC TV special, you know there's trouble.  \"Into The Blue\" isn't a half bad song until Reeves Gabrels shows up (and ruins it).  \"Butterfly On A Wheel\" suffers from boredom more so than anything.  I'd critique \"Sea Of Love\" except I can't remember a note from it.  \"Deliverance\" almost delivers until Simon Hinkler unveils perhaps the most annoying guitar tone of its time.  The ennui resumes in \"The Grapes Of Wrath\" (check out Camel's \"Dust And Dreams\" for a slightly more compelling treatment of John Steinbeck's novel).  You're so disenchanted that by the 7th track, \"Belief\" you are momentarily deceived into thinking it's a good song.  However, 4 minutes into the 7 minute opus, when you realize you're just hearing the same idea over and over and over and over, well, the luster lessens.  I would later learn it's best to stop the CD after \"Belief\" because the spiral downward (with apologies to Trent Reznor) is steep.  Honestly, how can any song titled \"Paradise Will Shine (Like The Moon Tonight)\" be any good?  Answer:  it can't (and isn't).  I don't remember a thing about \"Hungry As The Hunter\" other than an annoying \"yeah, yeah!\" that followed every chorus.  \"Lovely\" I believe is a brief acoustic piece that feature's Hussey non-too-lovely speaking voice.  All in all, this is a terribly written, dreadfully performed, incompetently recorded (by Tim Palmer, of all people) and downright insulting piece of half-baked nonsense.  The band itself was so disillusioned that they released all their outtakes in the hopes that they actually had an idea somewhere (1991's \"Grains Of Sand\").  It took me exactly 7 listens to decide The Mission had gone to hell in a handbasket and to eliminate it from my collection.  13 years later, I still hate every note on it (at least where there are notes to hate).","8325":"It's pretty easy to find Joy To The World by Three Dog Night.

Just buy it it's only 99 cents and it's EPIC!!!","8330":"Sorry, this just isn't a great album.

I belly dance and the music is great to create choreographies for my dances.","8332":"I am a Korn fan so I really disliked Head for leaving but this song is awesome... Dang it...

Oh well, win some, lose some.","8357":"David Bethany - True Love (Independent)\nSouth Carolina singer-songwriter David Bethany has certainly earned his musical spurs. He's the ex-frontman of The Killer Whales (check out their 1983 album \"Emotional Geography\" - produced by Jamie Hoover), and he's shared stages with Bonnie Raitt, Richard Thompson, Johnny Winter, George Thorogood, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Molly Hatchet. They say variety is the spice of life and anyone who's been musically involved with such a diverse group of artists must like mixing it up. So it is on \"True Love\", where he employs island rhythms, ska guitars, Americana melodies and blue moves. His voice, somewhere between Jackson Browne and John Hiatt, is easy and likeable, and adds some classic `70s singer-songwriter flair to a collection of songs that feel personal and real.\n\nHighlights come thick and fast. The title track makes an immediate impression with its Caribbean beat, hint of brass and a song (and vocal) that should be owning daytime BBC radio. \"Scotch for Supper, Cigarettes for Dessert\" almost lives up to its title, and features the most restrained and gentle of guitar solos; the sort of thing that JJ Cale would be proud of. \"Can't Hold On\" cruises dangerously close to perfection. An organ fed melody releases a country-rock groove, then a wandering trumpet mirrors the tune and takes it off to beautiful new worlds. It's an inspired three and a half minutes, and will undoubtedly be a massive hit in some as yet undiscovered parallel universe, where such things as genuine soul and tender, heartfelt songwriting are coveted.","8358":"good memories","8359":"If I had known that this was the radio version of this song, I would NOT have purchased it!!!! What's the point of purchasing a song that repeats the title when it doesn't even play it.","8360":"Can't stop listening to it, it's that good.

Swag.","8373":"The kbps rate barely reaches 3 digits on some tracks.  Good band, but terrible product.","8374":"Great CD. Using a song as part of my family animated Christmas light show. Always can count on TobyMac for something different and fresh.","8375":"This is a wonderful song by Matthew West that really touched my heart especially since I had already purchased the DVD, \"The Heart of Christmas\".  My favorite songs are \"The Heart of Christmas\" and \"One Last Christmas\" because they remind me of the brave little boy, Dak, who died of leukemia after a such a long battle.  This song tells of how a town came together to give this little boy one last Christmas to remember before he died.  I know I will play this song, the movie soundtrack and the movie, \"The Heart of Christmas\" during the Christmas holiday this year and all the years to come.  Always remember as one of the songs says to cherish each moment with your children, parents, and all your other loved ones as if it is the last.  Also, don't ever forget to tell them how much you love them, and don't take it for granted that they should know.  You never know when something might happen unexpectedly.  You don't ever want to regret not having said everything you needed to say to them while they are still here.  We all only have one chance in life, let's make the most of it, and cherish each moment like it is our last, especially with our loved ones!  Always remember the true meaning of Christmas is not getting presents, it's the  celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ!","8376":"Love all of Maynard's stuff. Hope new Tool comes out soon.

The music is amazing and the vocals on the entire album are fantastic! I'm blown away by how beautifully they have made the scripture into lullaby. This song is just perfect and my son and I love it! The perfect encouraging lullaby for your sweet child. I HIGHLY recommend this entire album!","8386":"Pretty good song.","8387":"It's TobyMac, how can I NOT like it!!! But seriously - I'm an African American in a Caucasian community.

It has only 1 (ONE) song by Fleetwood Mac from this tour. The next 5 songs are all solo tracks and the rest of disc 1 is interviews from the band members. Disc 2 is all different artists doing studio cuts such as Jackson Browne, Third Eye Blind, Fiona Apple Etc. and has nothing to do with Fleetwood Mac.","8398":"As a Christian music enthusiast, I often run across an individual or a band that has yet to be discovered by others. However, it is a rare moment when my ears are pleased and my heart is touched. On one such occasion I was relaxing at home watching \"Reflections\". Daystar produces this television program which showcases nature-loving videos with scripture notes accompanied with mostly instrumental melodies.\n\nOn this one specific night I had my eyes closed and suddenly this voice began to awaken and touch my soul. Then the message began to sink in and I had to rewind it to find out who it was. When they first started singing he reminded me slightly of Chris August but as the song continued it was more like the style of Jason Upton. It was melodically and lyrically beautiful. To my delight the person's name was a mystery causing me to speak to myself like I was Sherlock Holmes.\n\nKristian Binion was the answer to the riddle at that moment and God is the master of his talent. A graduate from Christ for the Nations International he learned early on what the significance of a close relationship with Jesus Christ brings to writing. With gifted musicians like Kari Jobe and others you have to wonder, what does this University instill in their students that other colleges do not?\n\nI received his current EP, which sadly only includes three songs. The first single on the album is the notable song I heard that evening and title of the EP, \"Pieces\". It speaks about how fragile we are and how often times we don't feel worthy of repair. However, God sees us as a moldable project as He restores us and makes us new.\n\nThis song really touched my heart as I sit discovering this artist as he moved my spirit. It is so personal and speaks to those who have a broken and contrite heart. At some point we all experience moments of heartbreak and desperation. It could be the loss of a loved one or a feeling of rejection. It could also be backslider who was once close to God who has fallen and is trying to find their way back. All of these scenarios fit the message, along with many others I have not mentioned. The closing segment is one of the most powerful lyrics I have heard recently. \"When this world pushes my heart to break. But every piece of it sings your praise. If it takes falling to see your face, then somebody push me for Heavens sake.\"\n\nKristian's heart is all about making God famous and hoping his worship will touch someone that needs to know that God is the answer to every problem they will ever face. We all have broken pieces or areas the world has vexed us in and if we turn everything over to Him, He can make something out of us to use for His glory. I have found myself asking God to keep me broken so that I never want to leave His side. Being near to God at all times is vital to our spiritual health and growth.\n\nI cannot express to you how gifted this young man is. You just have to be inclined to discover him for yourself. I do believe that he has a huge future ahead of him musically and spiritually leading people in worship and to a closer walk with Christ through his ministry.\n\nThe second song on the release is titled \"Narrow Way\". This is a message that is urgent for the Body of Christ today and the title is exactly what it is about. Many people today are on the broad path that leads to destruction. They have been tossed about with every wind of doctrine and spoon fed grace to a point they feel a personal relationship and repentance is not required of them. Kristian lays his heart on the floor before the Lord in this beautiful adoration of a man desiring to exemplify Christ. \"I wanna say what you would say. I wanna love the same way. Until everything I do is a reflection of you. I will follow the path you've made along the narrow way. There's a ladder you can climb to pull yourself up to the sky. But you will be sure to find you will fall if you get to high. But that ladder it leads back down where the humble and broken are found.\"\n\nAfter listening to the third song \"Strong Tower\", I was extremely unsettled about the fact that there were no more for me to listen to. This song brought out a different sound from Kristian and I had a hard time deciding which I liked better. It was at that point that I decided God's perfect number is three and this EP is one hundred and ten percent fascinating. That being said I am looking forward to seeing what God has in store for this extraordinarily gifted young man.\n\nEager to see how long I was going to have to wait to hear more from Kristian, I asked him when he was going to bless us all with a full length album.\n\nKristian - \"I'm currently writing new songs to go along with a lot more that didn't make the EP. I am praying and believing God for a full-length record someday. I know it will happen in His timing. Meanwhile, I plan to start recording some acoustic videos of new songs that God has given me. Those should be coming very soon!\"\n\nAs someone who is passionate about writing for God I asked what advice Kristian would share with others who have a dream to sing and minister and to share God with others in song.\n\nKristian - \"I would say don't ever let anything stop you! Not even yourself! I struggled for a long time with not feeling adequate or good enough. It wasn't until I surrendered to God and stopped worrying about what people thought. I started reading the word and seeking Him and God started dropping songs in my heart. I would tell God how you feel, ask Him to write through you. It may not come right away but God is faithful and He will begin to birth songs in your heart that will draw people to Him.\"\n\nToday you see a lot of youth struggling with choices either to fit in at school or with their friends outside of school. They are willing often times to sacrifice the gifts God has placed in them to use for His Kingdom for momentary popularity. As a young man himself growing up with the temptations and trials of youth I was curious what or who influenced him to lay everything at the cross and truly walk with Christ.\n\nKristian -\" I would have to say my Grandfather, V.R. Mitchell. I was going through a time in my life where I was not really living completely for God. I mean, I loved God and I knew how to act and knew what to say to make it seem like we were close. But in reality I was riding the fence. While I was visiting with my Grandfather one day it was like he knew exactly what was going on. But he didn't give me a speech or tell me I was a sinner. He just very calmly grabbed my hand looked me straight in the eyes as I was leaving and said \"Son, Grab a hold of Jesus and don't ever let him Go! That's all he said but it was all I needed! Instantly I knew it was God speaking through him. And I will never forget that moment the rest of my life! That is what I would say to a young person who is struggling to fit in. DON'T FIT IN! Grab a hold Of Jesus and don't ever let Go! It's not always easy and we are human. We will mess up. But don't ever forget to cling to Jesus it's the only way to make it.\"\n\nKristian is right we are human and we all mess up, but one thing is for certain he did everything right on this EP. Check it out for yourself and take advantage of being the first person to share his music with someone else. Trust me when I say don't let someone else steal your blessing from doing so. I hope and pray that this review may open doors for Kristian to explore that full-length album because I personally don't know how long I can wait to hear it.\n\nI would like to give special recognition for musicians, mixers and producers who made \"Pieces\" what it is. Thank you Daniel Lopez, Will Coleman, Josh Dufrene and Gregg Dunham for assisting Kristian by making this EP available.

I never heard it until this week. The lyrics are outstanding.","8402":"This is terrible. I feel like I've been had. theses are not the original artists and they don't even come close to sounding like the original artists.","8403":"The track listing lists both the song and the name of the artist, which led me to believe it was the actual original recordings or at the very least the real bands. It isn't at all; it's someone trying to sound like these bands and not doing a very good job. Perhaps I should have read more about the product beforehand, but I also think it should have been clearly stated somewhere in the official listing that this isn't in fact \"various artists\" but the same artist pretending to be various ones.","8404":"Horrible remakes, in most cases.  Had I known these were not originals, and in some cases, not the original performers, I would not have bought this, or maybe just a track or two.  I suppose this is the risk of digital downloads.  :(","8405":"These are definitely NOT ORIGINAL recordings although \"With A Girl Like You\" and \"You Really Turn Me On\" are close. Gerry Marsden and Eric Burdon are STILL GREAT, and you can clearly understand the words in the last verse of House of the Rising Sun. Also really good performances from The Swinging Blue Jeans and Brian Poole.","8406":"Great music","8407":"kind of silly to review music...either you like it or you don't. Not housey not trancy, just good old fashioned dancy","8408":"This was such a wonderful find when I was trying to learn songs for our church choir! Beautiful songs of worship and praise.

Anointed and touching, and I am still loving it after many years.","8417":"I had this song for decades, on cassette tape, and have missed being able to listen to it. It is classic Phil at his spiritual best and the trumpet interlude, of course, is also amazing.

It was led by two women, pianist Toni Brown and guitarist Terry Garthwaite at a time when the prevailing sentiment that women couldn't sing Rock. Great band!","8423":"It is too bad we don't get to play a little bit of the song before we download it to our device.  If we had, I would NOT have downloaded this version of the song I wanted.  It was definitely not what I had hoped for.","8424":"Not what I was looking for.","8425":"Life is good.  I saw this band in SF last year and they rocked my socks off.  Highly reccomended for everyone","8426":"Great song","8427":"People who like logic or a system for culling reason from life probably feel like this when a trickster has flooded the sacred meadow with contingency. The basic idea is about risk.","8428":"why did i buy this","8429":"First of all, I have been looking for this EP for quite some while so the fact that I got and for $4 was already a win-win situation for me. But what impressed me the most is I ordered this on March 8th; on a Saturday no less and I received it on March 10th. I was expecting to receive it within a week. But two days!! Wow. It was in excellent condition and new as advertised.","8430":"Or your grandparents!  They'll love this too, send it to 'em.  Because why send them a card, when you can send them into cardiac arrest?\n\nActually, who COULDN'T love this??  With such heartwarming lyrics like:\n\n\"I wish I had a c***\nI'd rub it in your face\nI'd shove it in your mouth\nYou'd really like the taste\nThen I'd STICK IT UP YOUR @$$,\nSHOVE IT UP YOUR @$$,\nRAM IT UP YOUR @$$!\"\n\nNeedless to say, this album can't be taken seriously.  It's quite hilarious actually.  Hilariously bad.  You'll want to be completely alone when listening to this - or better yet - don't listen to it at all.","8431":"Great band that was doing great electronic rock\/metal. They broke up but their music still lives on and is great.","8432":"too much audience noise shouldn't have ordered live performance","8433":"Misty Edwards is a highly prophetic singer\/songwriter. I thoroughly enjoy this music and have it on all of my mobile devices.","8434":"Anna Ternheim's debut and her second album touched me deeply: I felt her sensitive lyrics and natural, fragile vocal style spoke directly to me as I wandered around Berlin. This was all the more so on the first album which was more acoustic and less bombastic than the second one. But already on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Separation-Road\/dp\/B000WC2US6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Separation Road<\/a>&nbsp;you could sense that Ternheim wanted to become a pop star.

On German radio I happened to hear her play one track live - Lorelei-Marie - and found it awful. What's with the naive sentimentality and the oh-so-pretty vocals? Even Heather Nova or Sarah MacLachlan would be embarrassed to put that kind of oh-so-pretty triteness on one of their albums. And then came all the promotion - the website promising great things to come, the story of the album's genesis (being born during a power-cut, etc.) trying to - literally - spark interest in what is a thoroughly unimaginative album. The depth of feeling and emotional sincerity found on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Somebody-Outside\/dp\/B000CSUWPI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Somebody Outside<\/a>&nbsp;seems like a distant dream now.\n\nGoodbye Anna! It's a shame it didn't last.","8435":"Coco Montoya great muscian","8436":"Beautiful music I simply love!!!!","8437":"\"Best of Times\" is one of Sara Hickman's best cd's, from a different perspective.  It challenges the listener to actually listen to the words and music Sara has written and where she is going with it - not just listen to her beautiful, angelic voice.  For me, hearing Sara's songs sung by a different artist or group has definitely caused me to delve into deeper thought regarding all of her songs; not just the ones on \"Best of Times\".  Quite frankly, I can't think of a song Sara has released that has not been, how shall we say....\"releasable?\" She is a true ARTIST in this world, bringing her own styles and ideas not only out in the lyrics but in he instruments as well.  She definitely goes out on a limb sometimes, but is always ready to defend herself with confidence. I don't know how all of these teeny-bopper \/ american idol type people make it to the top and earn millions of dollars.  So many of them are around for a season or two, then they are in rehabs, disappeared, etc. And where is all of the fame and fortune promised to them? In some other teen star or agent's pocket by now.  Stick with the REAL musicians, the REAL writers and you'll never be disappointed.  If you want to learn all you need to know about relationships, love, anger, friendship, disappointment, sadness, happy times, how to be silly and how to be somber....all of those emotions can be wrapped up and sung by someone in 2 words....'SARA HICKMAN'  She'll be around a lot longer than the spears, biebers or lohans, that I assure you.","8438":"This CD has only two songs on it !!!!!!!!!!!","8439":"This group a great band to listen to. I only gave them 4 stars because they are not on the same level as either Slime or Wizo.","8440":"It's a fun song to hear. Puts one in a good mood.","8441":"The speaker is brilliant but the sound quality is very difficult to understand so have to strain to hear what's being said miss a lot of words and nuances","8442":"I love old music and this album adds to my gospel collection.

After the great \"Afrykanski Snieg\" (\"African Snow\") it is the time for something same \"twisted\", but in a different way. African sounds are, maybe not totally removed, but mostly replaced by jazz. Again everything is thanks to Andrzej Serafin, who changed his African traps to different ones, for example... central heating stove (!  which,  as the musician claims, tunes in D! The recording is highly eclectic, full of intricate harmonic solutions and deep, warm tones. It is a real windfall  for every lover of the music which  you cannot classify anyhow but as beautiful one.  Serafin's genius is completed with Staszek Grela's soft guitar and nice, dark vocal of Bozena Mazur. But despite appearances the music is not easy to deal with. The recordings are filled with ambient, psychedelia, acid jazz and samples which makes mood of gnosis, mystery, soaring to the higher level of perception. For sure it is the best Polish album of the year! And just think that all that \"mess\" came to existence thanks to the concept that rose in the head of Robert Lenert, the band leader, and with this idea, there was beauty and new dimension of art to rise...

Tried cleaning, its not my player.","8448":"Sounds like teen garbage","8449":"I enjoy listening to this music at any time.  The artists play the cello very well.

She slows it down a taste and just gets all into it.","8454":"this is NOT original...tricked me","8455":"Our church choir sang this song as an anthem and I was looking for a rendition in the same style.","8456":"Kick ass song.  Only thing I bought off the CD, had a $1 amazon digital credit to use.","8457":"Want to hear something really different and fun from the good old days of the cold war.........  Soviet anthems.  The music is very good, and fun to listen to.","8458":"Amazon get your s*** together.. this is beyond bad to have as your essential hip hop classics.. Prime music is dead","8459":"This really pissed me off, tricking people into purchasing covers of our favorite hip hop tracks. I guess it's ultimately my bad I didn't look closer and made an assumption that people wouldn't do something so low. Basically stealing.","8460":"These are really bad \"rappers\" covering these songs.  This is really the worst.  Just to be clear:  none of the artists ou expect are actually rapping these songs.  No  Missy, Jay, nobody.","8461":"Do not be fooled.  None of the artists on this compilation are the real artists of the songs.  They are all mediocre cover artists.","8462":"Melia - Soundproof Walls (Independent)\nA musician for just four years, Melia Kimberly Maccarone has already made serious inroads into a promising career. \"Soundproof Walls\" is her debut long-player, recorded with her band (Dominic Ciaccia - drums, Tim Latus - bass, Rob Cerame - guitar), with Melia responsible for lead guitar, vocals and the songs. That's quite a load for a 20-year old, but she seems completely unfazed, and her all-round performance is incredibly confident, leading her band through a collection of brash pop-punk and upbeat ska-rock.\n\nThe production on \"Soundproof\" is gloriously vibrant; the music almost leaps from the speakers. It's absolutely appropriate, as there's nothing lo-fi or half-hearted here. Melia's songs are focused and vivacious, falling somewhere between the navet and pop thrill of early Blondie and No Doubt's Jamaican infused bombast. Surely it can be no coincidence that \"I Wanna Be Your Girl\" brings out Melia's inner Gwen Stefani. It remains a highlight of the seven-track set, though there's no shortage of competition. \"Checking Out\" possesses a great vocal hook and serious guitars; \"Sleaze Parade\" is complex and technical, and thoroughly enjoyable. \"Stay\" indicates a talent for balladry, which might come in handy, should the mainstream come calling.","8463":"It's their best song. Whenever I listen to it I feel like all is right with the world and it makes me feel young again.","8464":"song","8465":"This is not what i hoped for\n\nT D Bryant must have been handled by some marketing folks\nwho steered him away from his roots due to his age\n\nbought  3 CD's looking for R & B\nNOT HERE","8466":"Just finished listening to cd. More rock sound than blues. You can hear blues style in guitar playing. Singing voice is okay for a young performer. In concert , the band kicks as_ !! Waiting for next cd-wild child.","8467":"Did not work! :(","8468":"But still worth purchasing if you are a Lydia fan.  I have grown quite fond of this music and incorporated this into my Lydia mix.\n\nI hope they continue to pursue this type of music as it seems to go hand in hand with Paint it Golden.","8469":"I let my friend know about the subliminal records and everyone was happy to spend the money, but this friend was not happy with the purchase.  Nothing happened.  She said she listened to them for a few months with no results.","8470":"This single really makes me want to go and buy the rest of the album. I have listened to Switchfoot since they started out. I have heard the song they play on the radio but I think I like this one better.","8471":"Dear Amazon,\n\nI want to know why the clean version of Mastodon's \"Dry Bone Valley\" costs $0.20 MORE than the Explicit version?  Do you WANT children to memorize the explicit version because it's cheaper.  I can not think of ANY REASON for this price discrepancy.  Please explain yourselves.","8472":"I JUST LOVE THIS SONG!! I have always been a fan so this song is just another #1 hit in my book.","8473":"Great song by a fantastic artist.  Totally worth the money as the recording is perfect.","8474":"Great Song And Singer","8475":"VERY BAD","8476":"never ordered","8477":"great","8478":"I DID NOT ORDER THIS","8479":"i do not now wat was this item","8480":"Not worth the money or time I haven't listen since the first day. Free apps work better. You won't fall asleep with this","8481":"After hearing this song for many years when I watch \"Christmas Vacation\" I wanted it to keep on CD.  It's a nice addition to my yulltide collection.","8482":"I enjoy the feel of this music. It makes me think of where I could be and who I could be with while listening to it. It's sentimental and I love where it takes me.","8483":"Terrible.  This sounds like a cheap bootleg of one of their early demos.  This is NOT the finished version of the song.\n\nDO NOT BUY!","8484":"The man is so good and very smooth!","8485":"One of the most beautiful voices out there! Soft, smooth, and sweet quality to Sarah's singing. She is sincere and sings a godly message.","8486":"It's not exactly what I was looking for but will work for what I want","8487":"great","8488":"I first heard this song on 106.3 Thunder radio  - and I loved the driving beat. I don't understand why this song was never released as a single - surely it would have gone to #1.  Big & Rich & Gretchen make for a super sound. The best thing about the 'new' Footloose album was this song!","8489":"Love it","8490":"Great","8491":"Awesome song. I love Joey & Rory and am praying for their family in this sad time!","8492":"Great song from the past, good sound","8493":"I was looking for a backround tape to sing the song at a funeral. This arrangement was played way too fast for this particular song, and lacked dynamics.  I was not able to use it, and had to find another arrangement.","8494":"I expected more for this big talent. I did not feel it.","8495":"The CD has a Latvian Tittle with a Latvian singers name.  The 20 songs are also listed in the Latvian language as Latvian songs. But,unfortunately the songs are not sung in Latvian.  They are sung in German.  I was very disapponted as a Latvian who got tricked into buying a Latvian CD.","8496":"This is a song that should resonate with every true believer. God didn't have to send His Son to save wretches like ourselves, yet He did. He removed the stain of sin & covered us in righteousness, making us new creatures in Him. He has truly made something out of nothing.","8497":"I am not sure how much of this is a weakness in the product or whether I am simply resistant to self-hypnosis, but I do not feel that this product is very effective.","8498":"Well it's a kids song so not expecting to much, my little sister enjoyed it while we where playing dinosaurs.","8499":"love this song","8500":"Great song.","8501":"Good song but wondered if there would be different editions of it. Because this song was hot and it would have been cool if they sold a EP","8502":"didn't do anything for me","8503":"But the best version.","8504":"I think she is the best blues singer of all time. this contains her best work. you'll love her even more.","8505":"cool","8506":"I didn't like it","8507":"Excellent sounds, but the track lacks enthusiasm. Redundant sounds with no awe inspiring transitions. Check out his other tracks though.","8508":"MIDI recordings, rather than actual piano playing, of the lowest quality. This is not proper Beethoven and arguably as low as you can get, looking for this music. Pity the fool.","8509":"I LOVE this guy","8510":"only three of the songs are sung which was disappointing as my expectation was to hear both examples of the composer and lyricists work.  also this album was a readers digest issue which was not explained in the original offer also the plastic case was damaged and couldn't be used fortunately I had an empty case to transfer it to.","8511":"I am enjoying Mr. MacMillan's music so very much!","8512":"This was recommended to me by a friend.  I was not disappointed.  It adds to my very diverse CD collection.","8513":"Pointless indeed! I thought it was a steal for the price. This line up of SPOCK'S doesn't even have NICK D'VIRGILIO. It's ALAN MORSE, DAVE MEROS, RYO OKUMOTO, JIMMY KEEGAN and TED LEONARD (of ENCHANT) on Vocals","8514":"Beware ordering this title in MP3 format - none of the songs here are complete - they're just fragments. To be honest, I'm not exactly sure of the point of this release. Anyhow, buyer beware!","8515":"This listing under a search for \"U2\" is misleading. They have a CD called Achtung. I thought I was buying a CD by U2 NOT a tribute band. I didn't notice it until it was unwrapped & in my player. As soon as the vocals started, I knew it wasn't Bono singing. Now I'm stuck with a CD I don't want.","8516":"I thought I was purchasing a U2 album...it is cover band material!","8517":"LOOKING FOR LIVE U2??? THIS ISN'T IT--NOT WORTH THE 8.99 DOWNLOAD PRICE BY ANY MEANS. AM A LONG TIME FAN OF U2 SO RIP-OFFS DON'T DO IT JUSTICE IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM","8518":"Took a chance on this song because I like the artist. This was a great choice !\nVery talented guy.","8519":"The following review is the result of extensive road testing on three different days and under different driving conditions, including suburban freeway, California coastline (both sunny and overcast), and suburban surface street.\nThe most striking thing about this record on a first listen is the strength and consistency of the songcraft. One after another the songs have catchy, hummable, moving, memorable tunes. \"Romeo & Juliet\" is reminiscent of the first original Lynch tune this reviewer heard (circa 1980), whose name is forgotten, but which sounded like an amalgamation of parts of five great lost Beatles songs all crammed into a single song; \"Romeo & Juliet\" also has more ideas than it needs, though the reference points here seem closer to Bob Seeger or Tom Petty or Thin Lizzy (see below), but it puts them together in a way that makes sense. Lynch's invention is equally effective in producing anthems, swampy rockers, folk-pop, and ballads. I've heard few albums by anyone on which the songs are so consistently effective; they are radio-ready exemplars of their respective genres without being generic, and one can imagine them being successfully performed by a number of different artists.\nOn a second listen one notices the lyrics. Rock music really does, to some degree, all sound alike; it's built on clichs. Most good rock music either transcends the clichs to find the original emotional force that motivated them, or acknowledges them with some degree of usually affectionate irony. These songs do both (a rare balance: Richard Thompson is another writer who has mastered this in his rock compositions). There are plenty of cars and girls and familiar rhymes, but Lynch recognizes their familiarity. In some songs, like \"Romeo & Juliet,\" the clichs are wallowed in and milked for all their resonant effect, though the song still manages to find a new image in the tried and true situation, such as Juliet's face illuminated by the brake light--viewed presumably in the mirror by the driver who is leaving her behind with someone else. One of the best songs on the album, \"The Best is Yet to Come,\" uses a device often used to good effect by Neil Young: mixing seemingly unrelated narratives and leaving the listener to figure out the possible connections. The haunting last line of that song (before the repeated chorus) is this reviewer's favorite of the album.\nMany of the songs reference rock music itself, and particularly its relationship to time and aging (another Youngian theme). \"Black Irish Rocker\" salutes with affectionate humor the aspirations of all rockers for authenticity, regardless of race, creed, color . . . or age. The speaker is not a teenager hoping to grow up to be guitar god but a middle aged married man who at first wistfully imagines being reincarnated as Phil Lynott, the Thin Lizzy frontman who parodixcally combined two conventional signs of authenticity, blackness and Irishness, to renew what might otherwise be the most easily parodied persona in hard rock (Irish blues guitarist Rory Gallagher provides another aspirational model of achieving authenticity by defying stereotypes). Rather than trying to return him to reality, his wife encourages him not to dream such dreams but to try to live them. He confesses to her that \"it's been getting harder \/ to separate reality from the dream,\" to which, in a beautifully enigmatic detail, \"she smiles her little private smile to herself; \/ she says, `I know exactly what you mean.'\" There's a black Irish rocker in all of us who (to paraphrase Mr. Young) should not be denied.\nThe song titles suggest the larger theme of the album: \"The Best Is Yet to Come,\" \"Where Have All the Good Times Gone?,\" \"Rock `n' Roll Ghost.\" This is classic rock about classic rock that asks how we should respond when we find ourselves 20 or 30 years on and still hearing its siren promise of ecstatic fulfillment. Some rockers burn out, some fade away into conventional adulthood, but some (think again Neil Young or the Rolling Stones) demonstrate that rather than seeming absurd in the old, sticking with rock in fact helps keep them young, which is to say it sustains in them a spiritual if not physical vitality as they grow and face age and ultimate oblivion.\nMore prosaically, but further evidence of the album's implicit argument, the playing is an impressive example of DYI ethos, with Lynch playing all instruments with tasteful economy, deploying a wide variety of guitar styles as called for by the particular situation, deploying a tambourine for just a measure or two (one imagines him waiting alone in the studio through the entire song to add that important detail), or walking a nifty bass line through the spaces in the plaintive \"Grace Hollogne.\" Finally (and especially for personal friends), Lynch's vocals deserve mention. His voice seems to have deepened over the years into a seaworthy instrument weathered like the deck of a well-used and well-maintained wooden boat (perhaps a gift of what one hopes is a long-abandoned smoking habit); the timbre perfectly suits the songs, but more important is the singing itself, which uses its own restraint as a source of expressiveness and authenticity.\nThere are many forms of talent on display in this record--songwriting, lyrical cleverness, musicianship, production, singing--but the deep, solid mineral vein running through it is its awareness and renewal, in each song, of the power of this sort of music to keep an aging engine oiled and running.","8520":"I have been blessed by Heather Williams music for years now. Starting with her first \"independent\" CD, and now through her latest, \"This Time Around\". With songs such as \"Hallelujah\", \"God Is Still God\", and \"Beautiful Thing\", and the other songs; it is hard for me to pick a favorite. I highly recommend this album!","8521":".............. and, having heard the song many times back in the seventies, wasn't disappointed.\nI'm a devotee of REAL, TRADITIONAL country music; what I call \"seriously logistical\", not the Nashville-influenced \"really-lurv-ya-hurny\" sort of mass-market junk, nor the pestilential yodelling of the old-timers, which butchered many a fine traditional country song,and set country's cause back by decades.\n\"Nobody Home ........\" fits my tastes admirably.","8522":"I thought that this piece would be the same as in the movie \"Dr. Strangelove,\" but it wasn't. It's the same music, but not the same classic piece from the movie done by Marlena Dietrich. I was very disappointed.","8523":"She duets w\/ Nick Cave on this song - this is one of the best cover songs I've ever heard - drop the needle & let it play","8524":"One of my all-time favorites.  Great performance and recording.","8525":"Not the correct soundtrack. A mixture of songs.","8526":"The idea here is that if you like Beethoven, you ought to like these other composers from Beethoven's classical era. It works for me. I already have lots of Beethoven in my collection, and lots of Mozart and Haydn who inspired Beethoven, and lots of Schubert and Weber who were the young up-and-comers weened on Beethoven. They're all here, along with Hummel, a very good but often overlooked contemporary, as well as Spohr, Sor, Cherubini, Kuhlau, Dussek, and Guiliani.\n\nWhat this collection makes me realize is that although Beethoven is said be the composer who most bridged the classical and romantic eras, he really seems to me to fit more squarely in the classical era. Two of Mozart's final works, the Requiem and Jupiter Symphony, greatly foreshadow Beethoven. When Beethoven \"went retro\" with his 8th Symphony (did he invent musical nostalgia?), he seemed to be aping Haydn's Clock Symphony. And even two of Schubert's most romantic works, the Unfinished Symphony and \"Death and the Maiden\", are still very classically structured compared with what was to come next from Liszt, Berlioz, Schumann and on. And nobody in any era ever sounded like Beethoven's later most advanced piano sonatas and string quartets. This is very rewarding listening and all top class stuff as X5 usually is.","8527":"There is a lot of music here for the price, but it is written by Weber, Schubert, Haydn and others. Where's the Beethoven????? I bought this album and informed Amazon over 3 weeks ago that the title is a misnomer and there must be a mistake in the track selections. Nothing has been done about it yet. Is anyone else buying this album???","8528":"I love Who od you Voodoo song..theme from DI...amazing 2 games..I jam out to this alot cause he is a good artist..the whole song kept you in beat the whole time","8529":"Song is awesome and it hits really hard if you play it thru a good stereo. I love the game and thought the song was hilarious.","8530":"Willie like a fine wine (I'm told) gets better as it ages. I should have made cheese my example because I'm somewhat familiar with that. Gimme Willie in the 2000's.","8531":"After I purchased the song\/ album,  it will not play. I've downloaded it, tried to use offline, online... etc. Stuck in a never-ending loading cycle","8532":"Good title","8533":"Great. Thanks so much","8534":"There are many versions of this song out there but honestly this is my favorite. It is so haunting and classic yet modern. You can really feel the raw emotion of it.","8535":"Its music only no words  fine for some one who only wants muscal rendering. But don't call it a tribute to Matrc Anthony if its not gonna have any of his songs","8536":"All I hear is drums. Either the preview clips are really bad or this is a lame album. I decided not to buy it even though I was really excited when I saw the title. Amazon, please preview longer excerpts. Don't want to waste my money.","8537":"Not the right record as advertised, Different song from the label. Wasn't happy when i played the 45. So if another copy is found with the right song i would like to see if possible to recieve it.","8538":"This is a cover album -- Not the original songs or artists.","8539":"Really interesting and enjoyable collection ofcountry music, some unexpected songs ,never heard previously unheard.  All in all a great collection.  CD's well packaged and arrived very promply and in good order.\n\nlorinalea","8540":"Awesome! Love this song","8541":"This track has a cool upbeat to it with melodies stuck in your head, Great Techno-Trance Vocals etc..B++++Some of the music could  remind you of the music that you listen to as well..","8542":"Didn't think of that when I ordered it. The 45 has the short version of Hold Your Head Up,\" and it almost seems like the long version was spliced right out of the short version (the long version had an extra long instrumental and you can almost hear where where it was ripped out!!) The recording itself was good quality with few snaps and pops during the song.","8543":"ex husband hacked into account and ordered them. No idea how it is working.","8544":"Wrong song. Wanted artist peripheral, touched wrong selection. This song is horrible, but doesn't matter due to my mess up.","8545":"Used this song at my wedding for the mothers march. Still sounds wonderful...","8546":"A true tearjerker!","8547":"An aquired taste","8548":"Got this as part of a free music sampler pack for participating in an Amazon survey somewhat recently, and was disappointed by its contents. This was one of them.","8549":"Awesome arrangement.","8550":"Boyz to Men is one of the best harmonizing groups around. This is one of their best songs. If you love good music and harmonies I highly recomend this song and this group.","8551":"I purchased this for my sister in law who is studying massage therapy. It is perfect for this application as you can set your MP3 player for no delay between songs and it blends beautifully even when shuffled.","8552":"The song is creatively written and wonderfully arranged.  One cannot help but to start rocking and tapping toes to the music.  Spike Jones takes his unique humor and music and throws right in the fuehrer's face.  It does not get any better than this.","8553":"Excellent","8554":"Great song from the 80's movie!","8555":"I am always encouraged when I listen to this album after so many years. It reminds me to keep my focus on Jesus as we grow in our walk of faith. \"We are striving toward the master and cheered on by the saints\". I first listened to the title song back in 1979 when I redeticated my life to the Lord. The title song is very special to me.","8556":"Excellent Gothic Rock!","8557":"The chimes are too highly pitched and way too active. It doesn't sound natural, and it makes the dinging noises in my head that I listen to these things to hide from even worse. The person who did this seemed to be under the impression that the beauty of a wind chime does not lie in it's random, occasional tones. I picture someone with a broom handle agitating the chimes for $ 2 an hour, though I'm aware that it's mostly all computer generated.","8558":"Alexa, loop wind chimes and forest ambience\nAlexa, set sleep time for forty five minutes\n\nThis plays wind chimes and forest embience in a continuous loop and then stops playing after forty five minutes. Our formula for restful sleep. Cheers.","8559":"a fantastic record in A+ shape... i love it...  service is great,prompt and great packaging... pays attention to details..","8560":"If this song doesn't stir deep into any heart that hears it, perhaps nothing will!. What a wonderful way to be \"washed in praise\"!","8561":"Wonderful instrumental of one of the most stunning worship hymns of all time!","8562":"I like his old cds better.","8563":"Redd is awesome and this is one of his best CD's. Redd is an Austin treasure. If you ever hear him play at the Continental Club you know what I'm saying.....","8564":"Great song!","8565":"If I was to track where this distasteful music originated, it would be the UK.  I wish I could send DUBstep back there, but, it would wonder back to the US, like flotsom and jetsom","8566":"Rum & Rodeo should have made Heather Myles a mega star. Every single word rings so true and they are sung with beautiful clarity. This song, (and the whole CD really belong in any road travelin' cowboy's pickup.)","8567":"How can I know if I even want to spend the money?? I can't listen or preview the songs?? There have been a number of items on here that are listed the same way.","8568":"Mario is an up and coming artist. I think he is actually going to be around a while because he has good vocals. It's just sad that songs like this don't get played at all. This single is strong and I think you would like it too. I bought it because if I'm going to waste some money mines well get something either different or something you haven't heard before. I think Mario, Trey Songz, Marques Houston, Governor, and Chris Brown are all in the same group. I can't wait to see who's still standing 5 years from today! Great song!","8569":"ok well what can i say in 20 words? pro's: it was cool when i have the $ i will buy a hard copy of the whole thing\ncon's; you can NOT, NOT! burn it to a cd so unless u only listen to music on ur computer then ur good but if u like to listen to it any where then IT IS NOT GOOD AT ALL u might even call it a waste on $ hey God bless hope this helped","8570":"Waste of $","8571":"Know the phrase \"Don't judge a book by it's cover\"? Know how we generally extended it to cover art? Well friends, this is an album whose cover art tells you everything you need to know: A stock image of a sunset sky, with a cross overlay, with the words \"Christian Dubstep\" prominently plastered at the bottom with an ugly waveform graphic behind it, made basically invisible by the text. I was hoping that the producer was better than the graphic designer, but alas, they are not.\n\nI was initially looking for the \"This is Christian Dubstep [year]\" series of albums I found while wandering the internet. The Amazon Music client led me here. I was particularly intrigued by the list of familiar song titles - \"Strong Tower\" by Kutless, a personal favorite, \"O Praise Him\" and \"History Maker\", two worship songs I sang in youth group, and of course \"How Great is Our God\", 2006's 'Trendy Christian song of the Year' award winner. This intrigue was evenly inspired by thoughts of \"I wonder how these songs sound as dubstep?\" and \"I wonder how much paperwork went into getting the acapellas for these tracks to make them?\" As I thought a bit more as my poky DSL line was buffering, I was like, \"wait...this probably won't end well\", and I was right.\n\nThe vocals on all the tracks are not original - they're either karaoke tracks or separately recorded - only the lyrics are the same. The tempo and sounds used have little variance between tracks; in many cases they're flat-out off-key. They kept the exact same progression of the songs as the originals. This can be a good thing, but it's clear that the only thing that changed between copy\/pasting the 'dubstep' overlays was cutting out a measure here or there to match the different songs, rather than actually reimagining them.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily call myself a true dubstep fan, but I do DJ for youth events, so I do spend plenty of time listening to a wide variety of Christian music. Christian music is its own topic of discussion and debate, but I generally find that they tend to be 'a genre behind' secular music. Just as Christian rock started to get good, the world shifted to urban\/rap - and on the whole, the early Christian rap albums weren't that good. Christian rap started to get good - I'd dare argue 'better than secular rap' - in the past few years, just as the world has moved on to EDM and its cousins, 'dance pop' and 'dubstep'. While artists like Har Megiddo, Matthew Parker, and a few others do a half-decent job at making some tracks worth listening to (again, the 'This is Christian Dubstep 2012\/2013\/2014' albums also having a few gems), overall, I consider this album to embody the worst aspects of the Christian music business, genre, and culture.\n\nI *very* rarely give single star reviews to anything, but when something is not only itself of poor quality, but is able to single-handedly illustrate literally every gripe I've had with Christian music in the past two decades, and the \"B-side cuts\" on other albums are better than the best that this one has to offer, that one-star is well-earned.","8572":"The original artists of these songs should sue this company - Relient K (Must have Done Something Right) and Kutless (Strong Tower) especially.  This album puts all the original songs in a horrible, horrible light!  I cannot even express how much the originals are ruined!\n\nTo call them a \"remix\" is NOT true.  These are not the original vocal tracks.  They are re-sung - HORRIBLY!\n\nCheck out the \"This is Christian Dubstep\" 2012 & 2013 albums for the real thing!","8573":"This is not even dubstep. It's very poorly edited, and it is an embarrassment to real dubstep. If god was real, this wouldn't exist.","8574":"Apparently, poop, times poop, equals this.\n\nThe first track is a collection of fart sounds set in nauseating opposition to Enya-like synth.\n\nThe second track sounds like a bad impression of the Thompson Twins, horribly processed by an auto tune amateur. With mandatory wub wubs to qualify as dub step.\n\nI could listen no further.\n\nCedarmont Kids: thou hath wrought an abomination. May God have mercy on your souls.","8575":"I'm so ashamed of this production. I would've expected more from a Cedarmont Kids album--or a 10 year-old's IPhone. The original songs were stripped of their power and dignity through this \"dumb step\" remix. I would follow the money---if there IS any -- and likely find that a satanic conspirator has decided to burn the Christian hand that dares touch dub. I'm 56 years old and have longed for a powerful scripture-based dub step album. What a disappointment. This isn't even brostep. I don't see Skrillex or Deadmau5 running for their laptops at the sound of this album...they are safe -- very, very safe. No healing here; no deliverance here; no warfare; no revelation; no inspiration.  No dub. It's like a hybrid -- a sterile donkey -- the breeding of Praise and Worship with PseudoDub -- the offspring is completely neutered, de-spirited, misshapen, offensive.  Christian themes are well-suited to dub -- somebody PLEASE issue a global recall of this toxic product and get the real stuff on the shelves so we can resonate with the tones that subvert the darkest beats -- so we can attune to the waves that soldier us through each day -- bring the real Blood, the real Spirit.","8576":"It sounds muffed to all hell.","8577":"Gorgeous music","8578":"If you really think this rendition of the song even comes close to disturb your a soulless imp that is dead inside","8579":"i never would have bought this if i would have known it isn't maroon five. i probably will never listen to it.","8580":"what I got to listen to before purchasing it I like and thought it was Maroon 5 but once I heard the rest of the song it is not and it is not Christina A! Could have given more of a description of the song so that I knew what i was purchasing.","8581":"Accidently downloaded this because the sample sounded like the original but it is not. Amazon needs to be more careful with samples because I would have sworn it sounded exactly like the Maroon 5 file.","8582":"Like it a lot. play it when I DJ. I just hate this word minimum for reviews. Why is it needed?","8583":"Great","8584":"This is one of Ryan Adams best music production. I downloaded Kindness, Lucky (my favorite), Dirty Rain, Come Home , and Do I Wait? It's the first release I've cared for since, \"When Stars Go Blue' and I'm always happy to get a new sound from this artist or others.","8585":"\"The ultimate goth...\" for years 1980-2011 and not a single track from The Sisters of Mercy. Okay.","8586":"I was just playing around with the idea of it ... ordered it ... showing my boyfriend and once I got it I can't figure out ... nor do I have the time to figure out how to hear it.  The price was cheap enough but it's probably only good for a laugh anyway.","8587":"It SOUNDS kind of like the original... for a little while,then you realize it's not and that it's much worse.\nAnother attempt at riding coat tails to get money from consumers by confusing them. Well, they certainly managed to scam 99 cents out of me. Oh well...","8588":"Once more I feel tricked. The lady didn't sound ANYTHING like Christina Agulera. I wouldnt buy it. Dont waste your time.","8589":"I thought it was sung by Maroon 5 but it is not, that was disappointing. The app was sort of misleading and should have specified it was sung by a different artist, not happy with this purchase, sorry","8590":"I was very pissed when I realized this wasn't the original song but rather a cover. No options to get a refund. This happened to me with several other songs before I realized that amazon sells Covers of songs and lists them under recommended. In some instances it was more difficult to find the song by the original artist than the lousy cover. I will no longer be purchasing songs from Amazon until they fix this nonsense.","8591":"When I looked up moves like jagger in the music store I clicked on the first one I saw! But that was a bad mistake on me because when I bought the song it didn't say who it was by! Then; the day after I but the song; I listened to it...\nAND IT WAS HORRIBLE!!! :( The guy singing the song is pitchy and the song is so kid friendly to the point where its aannoying! The only person in my family who seems to like it is my little sister; who rarely plays with my kindle! What I'm trying to say here is don't buy the app; its a waste of money!:)","8592":"I was actually quite pissed, i downloaded this via my phone thinking it was the version from maroon 5 cause it was very unclear. When I did listen to it i realized it was not them singing at all. So very pissed.","8593":"I love gamelan music, coupled with the more modern synthesized sounds, this is a perfect listen when you want to be transported to Bali & simply relax!","8594":"Not the original from the movie by Faltermeyer.....sounds like some guy played it on a $49 Casio keyboard.","8595":"This is a nice collection of tracks that represents The Good Natured well. I'm loving what she's putting out so far, and I can't wait to hear a full album. Definitely an up-and-comer, and I think she'll do a lot more growing. Give her a chance!\n\nUpdate: I decided to upgrade to 5 stars because the tracks are just that catchy, and I do think they work together rather well in this collection. I love the whole thing.","8596":"While strolling on youtube I found a song by Wellfear called Dealers Call.  I have been hooked on this band ever since.  Every song on this album is fantastic and unique,  the title track is my personal favorite but several of the other songs are same of my favorites as well.","8597":"This album has been on heavy rotation since i bought it (FINALLY!!!!) a few weeks ago after drooling every time I pulled it up on Youtube..... along with Message \"From Books And Dreams\" and several selections from Eloy, Jane, Can..... i'm surprised there aren't more folks diving headfirst into the Krautrock genre!","8598":"Enjoyed this classical music banjo.  Seems this album is meant to be played as a continuous unit, in that order, so that each track runs into the next.  Otherwise, alone, most of the tracks just seem to end before the number is finished.  I normally listen on shuffle  to hear a variety and these numbers that end short annoy.  But this is all i have against the album.  The vocals aren't great but add nicely to the overall sound.","8599":"Love the music","8600":"They never disappoint! I already had several other songs from this album. Wish I had bought the whole thing! They have such great harmony together. I love them!","8601":"If you have tinnitus that is severe, this will not be good enough to mask. If you are planning on using it for relaxation, find something else!","8602":"Love Lady Antebellum, just the right mix sound great","8603":"Good tune.","8604":"Beautiful lyrics and great beat. I love all their songs, definitely a good choice. I would recommend this song to any fan!","8605":"Can't stop listening to it!!","8606":"Favorite old it, and I love it.  Always thought it was a made up expression until I heard it on the radio one day (iHeart Kool FM), then went hunting for it.","8607":"If you love Lady Antebellum then you'll love this song. A soulful country song for those days you are feeling a little blue.","8608":"'40 Days' by Matt Maher from his album 'Welcome to Life' is a wonderful song about the struggles and joys of the Lenten season. It has a catchy tune and powerful lyrics. I first came across it through my church's Life Teen Band, and I loved it instantly! It's great during Lent or any time of worship!","8609":"It spoke to my heart.  Most of Bob Hurd's music I love, but it is\nthe lyrics to this that I love as well as the song itself.","8610":"Great modern death metal.","8611":"I was a huge fan of this bands debut album when it came out forever ago, still am. I loved their EP, I wasn't a fan of the production on their 2nd album so never gave it much of a listen. I finally decided to give this one a chance and I have extremely mixed feelings on it. I believe this easily could have been their best work, some amazing music on this one but the entire album is plagued by absolutely cringe worthy clean vocal choruses. Now don't take me the wrong way, I'd say I have a very open ear for this kind of music. I love everything from Cannibal Corpse to MCR but this just really doesn't work for me. It's like throwing bands like Zao, Chimaira and Fall out boy in a blender. As much as I truly want to love this album, I don't see it staying in my library. Dissapointing listen. Terror starts at home is a banger though!","8612":"Its s***ty metal that they give out for free, stopping being so damn cheap and go spend some money and support good music","8613":"I like these songs","8614":"The title says it even though its free i reccomend getting \"to whom the bell tolls\" that a good song. This song dosent say anything and is not enjoyable too listen too.","8615":"OK...Would have been nice to see this in higher bitrate","8616":"I didn't realize when I downloaded this album that is was so terrible. This is not heavy metal or hardcore or even hard rock to me. This is crap. I am only glad it was a free download so I didn't waste any money on it.","8617":"I ordered this product but never got it. If it is available please let me know. I can not rate it at this time.","8618":"I can't download it","8619":"Good but cover was really bad,torn.","8620":"The production is very \"old\".  And this song itself isn't very original or interesting.","8621":"I heard this version while lifting.  I thought...that's not Kelly Clarkson.  Had to go home and search until I found out who did the remake.  Immediately added it to my mp3 player!  AWESOME remake!!!","8622":"outstanding, very inspiring. Truly a gift. Great interpretation. It sounds beautiful every time. outstanding, very inspiring. Truly a gift. Great interpretation. It sounds beautiful every time.","8623":"The download is in MP3 format, which I cannot use in the CD player I own. The purchase is worthless to me, a waste of money..","8624":"This is an alright album to listen to from time to time. I'd recommend you check it out to see for yourself. Check it out.","8625":"Fear Will Cast was almost perfect...Since then they have been trying different things that have not worked. And this time, they have gone back big time. You can still hear some of their huge talent musically, but instead of moving forward with vocals, they decided to go the death metal route. Horrible. Hopefully they can find themselves again at some point in the future. You should to pass on this one.","8626":"Beautiful rendition of Valeria Lynch's Te Llame. Touching. Poignant. very romantic and well executed. Enjoy hours of listening to it.","8627":"Nice read","8628":"Can never forget this song and the beautiiful voice of the beautiful Whitney Houston.  What a tragic ending to a beautiful smile","8629":"Didn't realize these were not the original artists.  Disappointed.","8630":"It is not the original performers.","8631":"These are not the original artists songs. There should be a way that Amazon makes you aware that these are REMAKES.","8632":"'North Of The Border' was recorded in July 1967 and involves Duke Ellington performing as solo pianist with the Ron Collier Orchestra. The album was part of a project to showcase the work of Canadian musicians, and Ellington's presence was intended to give it some extra cachet.\n\nThe Canadian CD issue, released in 1995 on Attic, includes a 25 minute interview involving Ellington which gives some useful background information, as long as the listener is prepared to read between the lines. \"I never really think in terms of having the piano solo responsibility\", says Ellington. Asked how he liked having Ellington as his piano soloist, Collier responds: \"Oh it was a wonderful experience and opportunity Ted, but it had its frightening moments, I'll tell you!\" John Norris, a jazz writer and critic, is asked to give a 'quick critical analysis' of the resulting music. \"Now you really put me on the spot, Ted!\", he exclaims, before offering the expected platitudes. Putting it bluntly, if you haven't already got the picture, some of the music on this album is very undistinguished, and some of Ellington's soloing is inept.\n\nI can excuse Ellington's ineptitude. He can be quite brilliant as a pianist who introduces, accompanies, fills or acts as a foil to another player. As he says himself, he is not really a soloist. Also, I suspect that more technically proficient pianists than Ellington might have viewed the prospect of soloing over some of this music as a thankless task. To quote Charles Mingus:\n\n\"You can't improvise on nothin', man. You gotta improvise on somethin'.\"\n\nEllington's playing illustrates this point quite beautifully. On the pretentious and rambling 'Nameless Hour' Ellington is hopelessly and cruelly exposed. He fares only marginally better on the appalling 'Silent Night, Lonely Night' and there are moments in 'Aurora Borealis' when it sounds as if Ellington wishes the earth would swallow him up. His best effort is reserved for 'Song And Dance', a song that has a recognisable theme; something for the featured soloist to get his teeth into.\n\nEllington collectors might find items of interest here, as I have. Viewed as a whole, though, this is a pretty soulless collection. The group of featured composers allowed themselves to be labelled 'Third Stream', a movement attempting to fuse jazz and classical music. It appears that they were more interested in finding the Stream than in writing songs.","8633":"Tracisting posted here does NOT match the actual CD tracklist at all.","8634":"If this song was sung by Jim Morrison, it might have been quite decent.  It sounds interesting until Manzarek starts his caterwauling.  Holy gawd, absolutely awful.","8635":"love this song so very much, glad I finally found it","8636":"strangely, playing this track in the background causes increased speeding along interstate 92 (which fortunately results in heightened Wanted levels...more speed points for me)\nThanks again :)","8637":"Is this the song sung in Spanish that is a reflection of Donna Summer's MacArthur Park?  Oh please Yuri only wishes she had that kind of range.","8638":"Excelente CD... despus de participar con Orquesta La Solucin nos trae esta magistral produccin de la mano de Arturo Ortiz y un equipo de primera en los Coros nada ms y nada menos Tito Allen y Nestor Sanchez tengo este cd y se los recomiendo al 100 % lo calific con 5 Estrellas, Que Viva la Salsa.","8639":"I timed it... it's a nine-second loop.  Do you really want to buy nine seconds of audio, looped for an hour?","8640":"One star's the best I can do for a fifteen-second loop repeated for more than an hour.","8641":"I wanted to use this with my Sunday School class as we studied how Jesus Calmed the Storm -- well, as one of the kids pointed out -- there's no thunder.","8642":"Excelente !","8643":"Classic H-Town!! Yungstar with the crazy Freestyle at the end!!!!","8644":"One star because this entire recording is just a nine-second loop.  You're buying one hour of the same nine seconds playing over and over.","8645":"Excellent recording of Charanga music by a popular musician.","8646":"Early indie rock at its finest.","8647":"Wess Floyd - Foxhole Confessions (Blind Roar\/TIAM)\nIt seemed for a long time that The Replacements mix of punk attitude, power pop licks and unapologetic Americana had been and gone, and potential new torch carriers were decidedly thin on the ground. Of course, bands like The Hold Steady and The Gaslight Anthem changed all that, and now let's add Wess Floyd's name to the list. Not that he's a Johnny-come-lately by any means. His debut record (\"The Daisycutters EP\") first saw the light of day as far back as 2006, and the most cursory of listens to \"Foxhole Confessions\" reveals a confident and able artist well practiced in his chosen genre.\n\nFloyd's a talented writer, with his finger on the pulse of contemporary styles. That means although his songs are decidedly retro in feel, there's nothing old-fashioned or outdated about them. Perhaps that makes them timeless; I don't know, I'll need a couple hundred years to properly make sure. I do know that songs like \"Record Player\" and \"Williamsburg Nights\" deserve to be heard by lots of people. The former is an example of classic, rootsy Southern power pop. Killer hooks collide with crunchy guitars, a monstrous chorus and attitude aplenty. In a just world you'd be able to buy it on 7\" vinyl and wear it out on an old Dansette turntable, but you'll have to download it instead and use your imagination. As for the latter, it kicks in with a superb Stonesy riff before everything falls into place with soulful horns, lots of whoa-whoa backing vocals and Floyd's words, which bring to mind primetime Springsteen and Westerberg, and somehow merge New Jersey and Memphis into one.","8648":"This is a ravishingly beautiful collection by a remarkably gifted and capable musician. I have played it over and over and never tire of its beauty. This is one of my favourite finds of 2014. Kudos to Matthew L. Fisher! I hope he produces many more like this.","8649":"love this song!!!","8650":"Just Awesome!","8651":"We love her CD's because our daughter has enjoyed them since she was about 12 months. There is overlap on various CD's so you end up buying multiple with the same songs, but they are easy to pop in at home or in the car. It's nice to have her stuff separate from our phones so they don't become unusable when she listens to music.","8652":"Fun and good quality music production. The kids were singing along after one listening. Children's music adults can enjoy too. \"Heartbeat\" is more popular with my kids hence 4 stars.","8653":"My child loves Laura D's music but I was disappointed when cd was scratched the first time she listened to it - skipped on first song.","8654":"I bought 2 singles from this album: Tomorrow and I'll be waiting; both were under 201kbps in quality.\nTomorrow was 174kbps, and I'll be waiting was 200kbps.\nI also bought the song Gravity from another album of hers, and it weighed in at 187kbps.\nThough I love Mini Page's music (originals), I'm very disappointed in these purchases. I've bought many other songs online, and none have been less than 320kbps.\n\nI really hope that this situation will soon be rectified, because I would like to buy all her originals.\nSadly until then, buyer beware.","8655":"I am not sure how to describe why this is a 5 star buy. Not an opera fan, but the music and the singing are great, the songs have great stories, and the singing, well you will know what I mean when you buy it.","8656":"(from the composer)\n\n\"Aphrodite Nights\" was composed for the gourd tree, a unique instrument microtonal instrument invented by Harry Partch, performed by Ryan McCausland.\n\nProduced by Chris Opperman.\nRecorded, mixed, and mastered by Stephen Kolakowsky.\nArtwork by Tony Akins.\nRecorded at the Harry Partch Institute at Montclair State University with special permission from Dean Drummond.\n\n\"Aphrodite Nights\" was composed for the gourd tree, one of many unique instruments invented by American composer Harry Partch (1901 - 1974).  The instrument was built on a bough of eucalyptus to which several gourds with bells have been attached, each resonating a different microtonal pitch.\n\nWhile studying microtonal music at the Harry Partch Institute in Montclair, NJ, professor and composer Dean Drummond showed us some videos of gamelan music that I found to be very fascinating and I decided to compose something that was reminiscent of that style on the gourd tree.\n\nAs wonderful, imaginative, and flexible language is, and although words carry tremendous meaning, I often find it difficult to use words to truly attempt to \"explain the unexplainable.\" The benefit of instrumental music is that you can communicate feelings and ideas with pure sound, from the world of the wordless into another plane, using music as a way to transport the listener into that plane.\n\nOne of the most powerful benefits of music is its ability to conjure up past memories and feelings, and remind them of the past in the present.\n\n\"Aprhodite Nights\" is about the wild magic of love and about those moments when two people become lost in one another, each partner being in awe of the other and giving themselves over completely to those feelings, exploring each others minds, hearts, and bodies with equal measures of caution and abandon.  Those evenings when time seems to stand still and that they are the only two beings in existence, subtly guided in their movements by instinct and by the power of the Goddess of Love, Aphrodite, love being the driving force behind existence and creativity.","8657":"not worth it with the music you can't hear him talking waste of money","8658":"This song was feautured in season 1 of nip tuck and I became fascinated with the cool, unique sound. Had to buy it.","8659":"good jams!","8660":"Solid playing as always from mmw just wish Scofield wasn't stepping all over the lines or playing two bars as \"randomly\" as possible. I can't listen to this and the funny thing is I saw Scofield with mmw in 2014 and John seems to have found a better way to go. This is a so so only because of the guitar","8661":"Listen to this while in the shop working. Helps my creative efforts.","8662":"I stumbled upon this group about two years ago and love them!  They are now one of my favorite CD's to hear in my car.  Wonderfully played instruments and the songs draw you in and take you to some other place; either another time, another land, perhaps a Celtic landscape, or a Viking adventure or sailing out on the sea.  Love the drums, but the violins are terrific and make the band!","8663":"I have loved Allan Sherman since I found him at age 11 with Muddah, Faddah! His sense of humor hit me square on and I (and my wife) enjoy his recordings.","8664":"A clear and clean rendition of this song! Many memories attached to it for my kids and me, as well!","8665":"Don't waste your money","8666":"Directionless and irritating. The Doors with Morrison created a perfect synergy together. The only song I like w\/out Jim was \"I'm Horny, I'm Stoned\". Otherwise, don't bother.","8667":"Awesome music. Very convenient to download to the computer and put on my smartphone.  Will continue to get great music from Amazon.","8668":"\"Stand By Me\" has simply stunning vocals, and Ms Emerick makes the song her own.  I've been fortunate to have seen her in concert, and she does not disappoint.  Her ability to get to the very essence of every song makes her a talent to watch.","8669":"I love Sade all her songs her voice is so relaxing just love her I listen to her every day especially lovers rock she's so amazing my children were younger they use to sing her songs now they are grown and they still listen to her music","8670":"Emulating the great Amundsen, Scott and Shackleton in their pursuit of \"furthest south\" I have decided to embark on a similar campaign albeit pejoratively: to identify the worst recording ever made.\n\nIn any such quest, Sir Roger Norrington is always going to feature prominently in calculations. In all fairness, the shockers in his discography (as known to me) are legion. His Haydn for instance is banal in the extreme; his Mozart is the musical equivalent of turbo-lax; his Beethoven is comic rather than cosmic; his Brahms induces nausea and felonious indeed is his Bruckner: other than that, he offers a welcome relief from vibrato, orchestral excellence and metaphysics for those so inclined. Much to his anguish, Roger the Hapless has been trumped in my estimation by Mehta whose bone-lazy Wagner lays claim to being Ground Zero (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ring-Hlts\/dp\/B0000026OJ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ring-Hlts<\/a>). The matter is still in doubt: black holes await investigation, one of them being Sir Roger's survey of Schumann's Symphonies with his long-suffering galley-slaves: the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra (whenever I hear these poor devils. I rethink my position on euthanasia).\n\nHere are ten reasons why this cycle warrants consideration in my quest.\n\n1. 90% of the time, Sir Roger is metrical beyond a metronome. I sense that as a child, he underwent a formative experience with a brass-band from the local colliery: there is no other way to explain his \"oom-pa-pa, oom-pa-pa, oom-pa-pa\" approach to rhythm.\n\n2. Schumann's fever-pitch mania which is so integral to his psyche is muted in each performance.\n\n3. Unrelentingly, phrases are clipped one after another. Roger the Hapless also spurns vibrato with his usual degree of dogmatism. In consequence, every bar is a test of one's stamina.\n\n4. Geez, the strings of the Stuttgart Symphony Orchestra are vin ordinaire with a vengeance. Listen to them in the slow movement of the Spring Symphony: it's moggy central - meow!\n\n5. The Scherzo of the Second is the very definition of note-spinning. I yelled aloud \"FFS Roger - do something with the music!!! Do something! Anything!\" Alas, the great man was too busy worrying about vibrato to respond. Thankfully we all know there is more to this music than this banal account. The slow movement is equally vapid and shallow; not even a tadpole could survive in it.\n\n6. There's no apotheosis at the end of the Second: it's just another fortissimo to Roger the Hapless.\n\n7. Where is the barely suppressed excitement in the first movement of the Rhenish? How is such an omission possible?\n\n8. Mysticism, it is safe to say, is not Roger's strong suit . . . As performed here, the fourth movement of the Rhenish has little to do with the consecration of a cardinal; it's more an evocation of chop suey.\n\n9. Yes Veronica, it is possible to play the first movement of the Fourth as if it's in a major key: that's how little 'fear and loathing' Roger is able to generate.\n\n10. The stupendous transition into the finale of the Fourth - Schumann at white heat - is mundane. It's an embarrassment to compare it with the likes of Furtwangler, Karajan, Szell and Kubelik.\n\nUndistinguished as it is, this cycle offers no real challenge to Uncle Zubin's stupendous achievement: it's more boring and befuddled than sordid. Further afield, Roger's Brahms cycle on Hanssler is actually more horrific than this sorry affair - but who has the wherewithal to revisit such horror when life is so short? Not me! We press on.","8671":"This is as smooth as the best single malt that may grace a rocks glass to  the measure of three fingers neat !\nThe sound is so fresh & clean to ears & a mind that yearns to drink in the notes I found so intoxicating. This is\na classic favorite album of tracks I use regularly to fill my need for this style. It Speaks to what I like most about\nJazz at it's best. I would truly like to hear more from these guys. Not a bad track, not a one, for laying down sound candy.","8672":"Been a huge Oasis fan for over 10 years, but this takes Noal to the next level.  So far every song on his new album is brilliant.","8673":"I love Naxos recordings and I have most of these pieces.  Personally, I would hoped for the price that they could have included 100 pieces as opposed to 50 -- since many of the other samplers do this.  You can't go wrong with Naxos!","8674":"Glad to learn you have the mp3 upload here!  I loved this LP when it came out in 1976 and still own it.  \"Give You All The Love (Inside Of Me)\" was the finest piece on 'Mother's Finest,' in my opinion!  Bought two other mp3s; likely, I'll eventually buy them all!  Thanks an amazon lot!","8675":"there's not one GARY & THE PLAYBOYS [as they were still known as in '64] song on this so-called movie soundtrack.\nthey were the main attraction and Gary even has some speaking lines.\ndoesn't make sense.

Listen to the words!","8680":"I recommend!","8681":"Loved the movie and this music","8682":"I already reviewed this. Don't by it. get a different track this one is EQ'd poorly.","8683":"Don't down load this recording. The EQ is way off and it is painful to listen to. Take it from me, I played in on the air in 1959 on KAYO, Seattle. I know what it should sound like.","8684":"My 5-year-old is learning these songs and routines in dance class. He may not be the best in his class, but he LOVES it and he loves this music. This is probably the only song\/dance we don't practice at home because it's not really a dance, per se, but I can see him reviewing it in his head when we're in the car and that's good for him, knowing when the transition from Bear Crawl to Crab Walk to Frog Hop is coming up. Like the other Chris Zondaflex Tyler songs for kids, it's easy to follow because the song tells you what to do, and that's really helpful for the kids to learn and for adults who are trying to help them learn.","8685":"Love my music I like getting my music from amazon music store MP3 player","8686":"Ever wonder what it would sound like if some misguided group of mouth breathers decided to actually try to sound like the deliberate stupidity that is \"Mindless Self Indulgence\"? Me either. But here you have it...yay...","8687":"Gucci mane separated himself From The Rest Of The Pack With This album. I haven't heard a track from this album that I didn't like.","8688":"I bought this particular MP3 because it said it was \"clean.\" The sample didn't play enough of the song to let me know if the f-bomb was not used in this version. I went ahead and ordered it and when I listened to it, it was there.","8689":"Loved it in 1952--still do.","8690":"Lame album...  Dumb Songs!","8691":"I enjoy Voltaire, but this album is bad. The songs are poorly orchestrated, filled with tortured rhymes, and pointlessly absurd. The best song is the title track, and that is barely worth listening to.","8692":"Again, not Mali's best. Tiffany, she a good singer, however, not a favorite.","8693":"This was purchased for a birthday party with a Luau theme.

I recommend it for everyone.","8697":"did not order this. not sure why i was asked to rate it since i have no idea what it is or what it does","8698":"This could be a decent acoustic song to some, but I had a hard time understanding the lyrics.

Still, it s a pleasant listen when its on.","8699":"luv this song ! wonderful record to listen to or dance to. one of my favorites of all time for sure","8700":"I am very pleased with my purchase and I highly recommend this","8701":"Love the soul.  The Roots is a group I'll be checking out more often, now that I know how good they are.","8702":"This song was just what I wanted but it includes a bunch of blabbering monologue after the song is finished which was not apparent before buying it by playing the 20 second snippet.","8703":"This is suppose to be a song by Bob Marley but it is not , I don't know what song it is but I was not happy with that download, I guess I did not read the info carefully , it was a tribute to Bob Marley not the actual song.","8704":"This is one of my wake up songs!!! Love it! Definitely better without the rap... I listen to it over and over again.","8705":"I've been hooked on Del McCoury ever since I saw him perform 1952 Vincent Black Lightning on the \"Down From the Mountain Tour.\"  Great versions of Bill Monroe's music.  If you like timeless bluegrass, then you won't regret picking up this release.  However, if you're new to Del McCoury I recommend starting with \"Del and the Boys\", which remains my favorite Del McCoury album.","8706":"family member downloaded for their mp3","8707":"Good kids song.  My young son enjoys it, and it is not annoying with repetition.\n(filling minimum word req here)","8708":"Not the original artist","8709":"If I had a choice I would not buy this album again. If you are thinking about buying this album listen to the tracks toward the bottom.","8710":"Where is the original Eagles version? But this one is ok.","8711":"Really transforms your consciousness. Great for massage and healing work. Excellent to clear space and infuse the area with loving energy.","8712":"i love how their guitars sound very much like motorhead, i love the rocky voice and their lyrics are different than most bands too.","8713":"\"Dreamtime Shuffle\" from the album \"Live And Proud\", was recorded with the Kiwi Blues Band at the major Wellington TV station in New Zealand. Original vocals and lyrics penned by Gerry Joe Weise.","8714":"I was hoping for a decent compilation of songs to play for my friends wedding. While the selection of songs is great, the quality of the re-makes is not good - they all sound low budget and the quality of the talent is questionable. The only useable ones are ones that no one has heard a lot of - maybe the Limbo, Congo etc. Try a different disk if you want decent quality recordings that are closer to the original. Sorry :(","8715":"Says Animal House, but it's not...cover band of some type. Wish there was a clear way to fix it, or stuck paying the 98 cents twice.","8716":"Not the original artist","8717":"I really liked this song when it was out in the early 70's, but this version sounds like a remake or remix - I prefer the original.","8718":"\"Requiem 3\" is the third in a series of classically-styled piano solos by Canadian\/Iranian composer\/pianist Fariborz Lachini. In keeping with the theme (a requiem is a piece composed in honor of someone's death), the eight original compositions are slow, reflective, and melancholy, but this is not a dark or depressing album. Always graceful and elegant, this is some of Lachini's most beautiful and evocative music to date. A very prolific composer who has done a great deal of film soundtrack work as well as his own arrangements of Iranian folk and pop music, Lachini has a distinctive style that often reflects his own cultural influences as well as his European musical training - a true world musician! Fellow pianists will delight in the companion songbook, which is also reviewed here.\n\n\"Requiem 3\" begins with \"Farewell to Past,\" a somber piece that is sad but not without hope. The extensive use of trills enhances the emotional quality of the piece and gives it a more classical approach. \"Secrets and Dreams\" is strongly influenced by some of Chopin's nocturnes and is a favorite. The emotional nature of the piece touches the heart and evokes a deep sigh. \"Morning Light\" is delicate, hopeful, and very moving. \"Silent Truth\" again hints of Chopin's introspective melancholy with a slowly flowing left hand and poignant melody - another favorite. \"Shadows' Fate\" has a somewhat more tragic quality with an elegant melody and gentle left hand accompaniment. \"Embrace\" is slow, graceful, and very passionate. \"Dilemma\" beautifully conveys the emotional confusion of having to make a difficult choice. Very introspective and again very poignant, it's a wonderful ending to an outstanding album.\n\nFans of Fariborz Lachini will be thrilled with this newest release, and if Lachini is a new name for you, this is a great way to get acquainted with his music! Recommended!","8719":"Retro music that is great for dance classes","8720":"First heard it on So You Think You Can Dance and fell in love with it! Great place to hear new music you might have heard on the radio.","8721":"I am not a big fan of this band but this song is Amazing, if you love metal, you will love this song.","8722":"Great song with a take on bullying.  To me this song is an anthem to all those who get bullied.  Well done video also.","8723":"\"B Good 2 Me Jam\", was recorded in Arizona with Gerry Joe Weise's USA band, live and loud in the studio with heavy rock blues!\nThis re-edition of \"Blues Down Under\" by Blues Breaking Records in 2011, is a welcomed one. The best of the best are already on this disc, but the 4 bonus tracks are something else. Apparently they are from the same period of time, so this is of value for all the Gerry Joe Weise fans.\nThe 4 bonus tracks are :\n1) \"Earth Spirit\" - Australian aboriginal music meets boogie blues via the didgeridoo and vintage electric slide guitar.\n2) \"Magnificent\" - caters to the Eastern influence, and has exquisite magical slide playing.\n3) \"Blues For Gandhi\" - even more Eastern in flavor and has a strict Indian influence. This composition is performed with the musicians from Ravi Shankar, and features Gerry Joe Weise on opened tuned electric slide guitar, and Indian tuned acoustic guitar, much like John McLaughlin and Shakti !\n4) \"Midnight Freestyle\" is a groove beat snare drum played with brushes, and has a question and answering situation between an ancient Dobro guitar and a vintage Stratocaster.","8724":"For me, music truly is not only important but critical for life management. Listening to Deep Theta helps me to move into a different mind-body space and view the world from a much more holistic perspective.","8725":"This song is very nice and relaxing, I like very much an would recommend it to my fiends. I am sure this is great CD.","8726":"very very relaxing...one of the best relaxing songs of all my nearly 40 relaxation song collection","8727":"Awesome Christian cd","8728":"Beautiful","8729":"NEVER GOT IT!!!","8730":"At first I thought it was exactly this song from family guy lol: [...] but it is not, it doesn't even have asian in the name.

I LOVE ALL OF MF Dooms music. He needs more airplay.","8735":"ACTUALLY IT WOULD BE ZERO, SONG IS NOT COMPLETE.","8736":"Gloss is a sassy hard rock\/soft vocal collection of smart and clever tunes.\nAlso includes a cover of the Duran duran tune 'girls on film'.\nJaen rocks!","8737":"Great for a luau!","8738":"I love love love this song.  It is the song on the Greg Laurie Television show that airs on Friday nights on a Christian station.","8739":"I love this song. It is so encouraging to me and I think to other believers. Phil Wickham has an amazing talent and it shows here.","8740":"Fantastic! Good job Phil! Been playing this back to back for days... LOVE IT","8741":"Great for getting in the mood for HI.","8742":"One of Wickham's best and all of his are good.","8743":"awesome","8744":"Good cd","8745":"One of the best versions of this song recorded. Live, in this case, just means awesome.","8746":"It's a deep song, some people might like the rock styling, but once they listen to it enough times; they get the meaning.","8747":"I was unable to get it into my music library. When I downloaded it from \"Cloud\", it came in as a number with amz at the end and no song title. My media player naturally couldn't recognize it,so I never could burn it to a cd.","8748":"Bought thos song by student request during out music appreciation week. I hate music like this, but it's produced well.","8749":"Whomever released this version of this fantastic Boots song is ripping us off.  This recording has electronic drums in it.  Clearly it's not from the recording this person claim's that it is.  Just look at the album cover - Boot's is quite young, obviously BEFORE electronic drums were invented.  THis version is probably one from the 80's or 90's.  Don't buy it.","8750":"No, I never used it for my wedding, I wish I could return it . The music is not what I expected at all.","8751":"The man's voice is so low no matter how loud you put your speakers you can't hear him. Then he only talks for a few minutes and the rest is just music.","8752":"Jose Feliciano once again never fails to please.  This album is good for the heart with soulful love songs.  Somehow Jose always makes them his own.  With beautiful guitar work, and that voice, you can't miss.  I saw him in concert recently (Snoqualmie Ballroom in Washington) and he is just as amazing in real life.  This is a wonderful production that captures the magic, and the musicians who accompany him are top notch.","8753":"Every singly one of these songs seems to be lifted directly from other artists.\n'Just wasting time' is Jarvis Cocker's 'Don't let him waste your time'.\nYou didn't even bother to listen to the lyrics, man.\n\nWhat gives?","8754":"Inspiring words and great harmony!","8755":"Awful, Awful,Awful!!!","8756":"You cant hear him the music is so loud. Its awful not relaxing. He speaks so low even in the parts with out music you cant tell what he is saying.","8757":"If you are a true jazz lover you must add this to your collection. This is the best jazz album I've purchased in the last 10 yrs. I would vote for this as Jazz Ablum of the year (it is that good). All my friends love it.\n\nJJ","8758":"I have not been able to find this or the other 2 songs on my computer\n\nEasy to find music to download\n\nAfter searching and reading directions (help)I still have not been able to find any of the three songs I have downloaded to my computer","8759":"wrong song","8760":"I got this album not too long ago and can't stop listening to it.  Its catchy, the bands got tons of talent and the lyrics are thoughtful.  Really an excellent little known band","8761":"This is Annie Lennox's most haunting song that I know of.  In the heat of 110 degrees of summer, I get cooled off by Ms. Linnox's wintery lyrics.  She was still in Eyrithmics I believe and she should have been nominated for Best Original Song at the Oscars...and won.","8762":"Very Nice","8763":"This is a truly beautiful album.  It is relaxing and peaceful.  I was gifted this album back in 1996 and I wore it out!  I am so grateful to Amazon, to be able to have it back in my life!!!  If you practice yoga, or meditation, you are going to LOVE this album!","8764":"Love it! Mrs. Fannie song this song all the time. It sort of brings back my childhood memories. Ril Mrs. Fannie Mae Franks!!","8765":"Beautiful.  Love Marco Frisina's works.","8766":"Spectacular!!!!","8767":"Not sure where the producers of this recording got the charts for this piece, but this is definitely NOT the main title to SHIP OF FOOLS.  This is a more langorious piece of music-I suspect it is the love theme-than the main title, which is reminiscent of Herrmann's main title for NORTH BY NORTHWEST, with a Latin feel to it.  If I would have known this was the content of the track I would not have purchased it.","8768":"Too bad we do not have more of the songs by this artist, who was part of a group called Mobb Style from Harlem, NY. This is conscious music with heart soul, a message and a classic beat......","8769":"Great music, good recording.","8770":"Absolutely LOVE this song and Richard Hayman's version on the harmonica is the best! Such a beautiful song.","8771":"jass is my favorite, this is a smooth jazz, very relaxing when you have had a stressfut day. really enjoy this.","8772":"Wasn't for me","8773":"I like,nearly, everything in the Chillaxing  Jazz Collections","8774":"i like the woman singer singing that's what friends are for","8775":"I don't have this?","8776":"Bought for a friend but I didn't care for it. He loved it.","8777":"Great rockin' instrumental music. The songs are exciting and have a real musical quality, something you don't always find on this type of CD.\n\nThe disc arrived early and in good condition.","8778":"Hard to pick a favorite of these songs. I like them all. Many of them are quite humorous, too. I am very impressed that he writes the music and lyrics himself and there isn't a bad one in the bunch. I think my favorites would be the Bruichladdich Dram, Special Sippin' Whiskey and Turquoise Frame of Mind.","8779":"Nice piece of music but there are terrible glitches and skips at 1:09 that run through about 1:23 in the Amazon MP3 in this track.  It needs to be reprocessed and re-added.\n\nI wish there was a way to report problems in the Amazon player.  Would be a lot easier than writing a review.","8780":"I've thoroughly enjoyed this CD! If you like Beatles and European classical music THIS interpretation is the project for you. Great background music for work, driving, walking, or just a leisure day spent almost anywhere.","8781":"Powerful","8782":"I expected this to be a full piece prelude like his others. I needed to use this as a backdrop for drama instruction and this was way too short!  Want my 99 cents back!!!","8783":"this is the wrong cd note pic  millenium caught in the warzone not angel dust lets get it right still don't have right","8784":"no way to tell whether this is any good or not - the sample is about 5 seconds long and only gives the early cello.  Actually, I have bought such a track from emusic and there is never any singing - you get 15 seconds of prelude and that is it.  So I have no intention of buying this to see if it is complete or listenable.","8785":"Not a very good version","8786":"Love Maroon 5 and nothing to hate about the song","8787":"only 2 songs on the cd.  Could have brought one with more songs cheaper at target. Feel like some one burn a cd from one they had.","8788":"Nina Hagen is one of my favorite artists. I have seen her perform at least 50 times in concert since she came out with Nunsexmonkrock in 1978 or so.  I have videotaped her performances and we have chatted through email. I do not like to disapprove of any artist's product, but this particular CD is not her best.  It has an old feel to it, like recycled 1970's rock, which would not be a bad thing if it was in any way interesting. But it is not.\n\nThe lyrics, all in German, may be compelling, but I don't speak German, so I cannot comment on their potency.  However, not knowing the meaning of the lyrics does not necessarily affect the appeal of the whole; other albums all in German are superb, e.g., Freud Euch (In English Bee Happy) In Exkstace (in English, In Ecstacy) as well as Angstloss (in English, Fearless) which has never appeared on CD.  But somehow, this album does not quite cut it.  After playing it a few times, I sold it on Amazon. One day, I may encounter it again and love it. But today is not the day.  This is also the only album of hers that I have ever sold.  All the others, I adore and play pretty regularly.  This one was not compelling.","8789":"cannot review it because it does not allow you to listen to the tracks... the movie is delightful and i remember the soundtrack being worth of attention but not here","8790":"It's Harry James; what more can be said!","8791":"I have encountered the pianist before with no problem, though he is not a prominently recorded artist. In this case I hesitate to give a poor review because of the scarcity of extensive piano selections from the NFAMB. This particular album, while dirt cheap is heavy handed and joyless, also it is SLOW and unvaried piece to piece. Would love to hear someone like Gould or a modern player like Pletnev or Hewitt have a go at these simple pieces, which would benefit from a less literal interpretation.","8792":"you here crickets more than the wolves  very disappointin, don't buy","8793":"It's wolves howling for 31 minutes. The crickets are louder than the wolves. And there it is.","8794":"Sadly the overwhelming sound of crickets prevents the sound I was hoping to hear...the howling of wolves. Thankfully it was only a 99 cent loss and next time...I'll read ALL the reviews.","8795":"I first listened to it on my iPod with earbud in and it was great, but when I tried to use it with my dock while sleeping my air conditioner drowned out everything but the crickets.  And other noise drowns out the wolves which is the whole reason I bought it.","8796":"I purchased this track because I love the sound of wolves howling and I figured, \"Hey, here's a whole hour of wolves howling, how nice.\" Out of the entire hour you get about 7% howling spread throughout the track and cricket noises for the remaining 93%. Listen to the 30-second sample clip and hear how annoying those crickets are. That's what you get. The howling that you hear in the 30-second sample? That's most of the howling that is included in this hour-long track. They should have called this track \"Crickets Occasionally being Interrupted by Wolves\".","8797":"Similar to Jackson Browne who I have always loved.","8798":"Very goog","8799":"I bought songs from this in the early morning hours and after listening to them a few times I don't know what possessed me to buy them in the first place. The album would make an excellent video game album.","8800":"This is not the advertised track. Rather it is another song (Casanova - Don't Talk About Love) from the same compilation.","8801":"This is not Anacrusis!  It is free but do not use this song to judge the band Anacrusis.  Hopefully they will fix this error and provide an actual song by Anacrusis.","8802":"To compensate for their minimal exposure on major labels since the Masur era ended, the NY Phil. has been hugely proactive in releasing Alan Gilbert's concerts on their house label. Every one of them seems to be available as MP3s, and one must admire the sound, which is very fine, all but miraculous considering the acoustic deficits of Avery Fisher Hall. How can it sound so ugly in real life and so lovely through a microphone? Here from October 2009 is #15 of thirty download concerts to celebrate Gilbert's first year as Music Director. The program is a crowd-pleaser featuring the Symphonic Dances from West Side Story, all but immortalized by Bernstein's own version for Columbia Records with this orchestra, and the stomping Suite No. 2 from de Falla's ballet The Three-Cornered Hat,which Bernstein also played the daylights out of.\n\nIt's both daring and nostalgic for Gilbert to follow in LB's footsteps, and I wish he had found some swing and sassiness in the West Side Story music instead of the polite, reserved, totally unconvincing performance he actually delivers.  It puts one foot ahead of the other in such a pedestrian way that I can only imagine what the old hands at the Philharmonic were thinking. This is music that defies polite handling - too bad. At least thee are some big, brassy sounds in the Rumble, but it's weak tea compared to Bernstein's knife wielding. conducting this dull is positively un-American.\n\nThe Falla is also too polite, lacking any sense of earthiness or flamboyance. This isn't even the Spain of tourist posters, much less of the country's most famous dance piece. There's really no point in detailing a mere walk through. The signs weren't good for Gilbert to light a fire under the Philharmonic, and the only bright spot is that the musicians and critics love him, apparently, which is a change from the dispiriting Masur and Maazel eras.","8803":"The music is pretty good, but what upset me was the tracks are out of order. It just took me out of it.","8804":"Great album.  Victoria was sublime.  The performance here is also sublime.","8805":"Monotonous","8806":"I always listen to my new music at least 3 times before I am willing to do a Amazy review. Learned my lesson over the last couple of months. Just because there are other great written reviews be cautious. If the one song you like makes you then believe the rest of the music will be the same. \" Don't. \" I buy alit of music from Amazon and it normally works out. This one plus all Griffin's don't. I bought them as a group. I now regret it. Its up to you for me \"no.\" Do your research. Sirius radio plays the hell out one song. I guess thats where mp3s come in","8807":"The mind, spirit and empathy of Atahualpa Yupanqui are what I love.  His voice and his guitar's voice melt together and simply accompany the listener.  Even people who do not understand the meaning of his words can feel that they understand everything he is saying.","8808":"This is not worth the money or the effort spent on listening to poor written music by DIVEBOMB. Casanova who?","8809":"Ordered mp3 file of this sone and got a broken link to an PDF document. Emailed Amazon ...never heard back...lost .89 cents\nnever got song....","8810":"Im not one to complain much but man these songs were lame. 90 seconds in and we just stopped. Not worth the money.","8811":"sucks","8812":"Christmas music played by perhaps the greatest violinist of all time.","8813":"This is one of the most needed albums in Christian\/Praise music today.  The music not only serves as excellent praise but also contains an elegantly simple, yet deep and restoring message.\n\nOut of the Deep is remarkably unique, being primarily a darker collection while remaining uplifting.  It meets listeners down at a place of unrest and brings them forward.\n\nIt doesn't neglect the valleys in life; it adores the steadfast power and grace that leads people from despair.","8814":"Just classic!","8815":"Issa, me thinksa yousa gonna find thisa sadda thing, thadda you cantsa singa goodsa songsa. - Jar Jar, your biggest fan.","8816":"Carefully packaged and fast shipping.\nAs described. Brand new.\nI will be back!","8817":"This is the first time I've heard stuff from this band as a group, but I've heard the lead singer live before.  His vocal talents are simply incredible.  And all three songs on this demo album are great expressions of those talents.  Buy the songs and you won't be disappointed.","8818":"Somehow I felt this performer didn't do the best version of this song.  In other words, the performer didn't do this great song justice.","8819":"When you think of classic Tal Farlow, you think of the Verve sessions. Equivalent to the Sinatra Capitol recordings as a great artist at their absolute best.","8820":"AWFUL!","8821":"Could not follow with hymnal","8822":"You can tell they're having fun - the G major piece in particular is a delight.","8823":"Broquen case","8824":"This Is A Pretty Lame Mixtape But With What Watts Had To Work With He Made The Best Of It !! The Last Song By Aqualeo Called Get Ya Hand's Up Is Tight The Best Song On The Cd !! It Also Has What Ya Know About That By T.I. And Tussle By Big Tuck Of D.S.R. Which Is A Really Lame Song . Pass On This One And Get Paper Chase 05 Which Dropped Before It Thats A Good CD !!","8825":"Came across this song in a trailer and just needed to have it. It's subtle and repetitive which usually equals boring, but this is a song that you just wrap around you.  The general vibe reminds me somewhat of Active Child, but not as complex. This song though just floats across the cosmos and conjures up grand houses now standing empty, standing on top of a mountain by yourself and something not quite natural. The basic piano line bumped up with tinges of electronic makes for a compelling and ghostly soundscape. Love.","8826":"This song is totally worth the buy. It is very soothing, but also gives you the music goosebumps that equal a great song. Seriously played this over and over again.","8827":"Great traditional Scottish music.","8828":"I'm to sure what  this artist is up to. The music has little focus and it is only minimally entertaining.","8829":"Keeps cutting off the last 15 seconds :(","8830":"I love skillet all of there music is amazing and they have so much talent I would recommend to everyone","8831":"I think I bought it just because I wanted to have more church music in my collection . . . I imagine there can be several versions of this song that I'd like more.","8832":"great songs","8833":"My favorite church song.","8834":"its music, what's not to love?","8835":"Roscoe may have worn himself thin giving everyone else great hooks and not keeping any for himself.  This song is pedestrian at best as far as rapping and production.  The chorus is weak (for Roscoe Dash) so you can skip this one completely.","8836":"My internet was very strong and although it appeared to download I didn't get a chance to open it right away and then it said it was no longer on my list. Not to mention it didn't even repay me for the song. I know its a small amount but still, if it didn't even download I should at least get some compensation.","8837":"Same as my Hail Mary, Gentle Woman - cannot listen to it on my android.","8838":"I'm old enough to remember when this album just came out!  I love it as much now as I did then because there is a mix of Advent and Christmas music as well as a variety of styles.","8839":"This is my most favorite song of Ben Howards.  Followed by: Only Love, Gracious, and Old Pine. Get this song!","8840":"Love this album - heard it when it first came out but lost all my albums with a house fire.  So nice to reconnect with one of my favorite Singing Jesuits.  Lifts me up in my morning meditation.","8841":"Used this with the \"Arise\" program at my church. It's a great traditional song that everyone can sing along with.","8842":"Excellent, as anything else he performs.","8843":"Great gameday song to get you amped up for some Packers football!!! (or just irritate the opposing fan in the room)","8844":"As the people of God we are required to daily present these vessels upon the altar as living sacrifices.  My walk with the Saviour has spanned well over four decades and I can assure you that if your desire is to seek an audience in the throne room no work can prepare your heart better than \"Worship from the Altar\" to enter in.","8845":":poor moods..not pure moods. It was terrible. Don't buy it. I already removed the tracks. Poor moods. Not happy. I will keep using Pandora I guess","8846":"Pleasant music for listening.","8847":"I enjoy Technomind's products and have a large collection of their work.  I like the idea of a relaxing \"owls in the night\" audio track.  However, after hearing this track I would say it needs a little less of the loud crickets and a little more of the hooting owls.  Perhaps a peaceful stream with owls hooting would be better.  But for someone that likes crickets, they may enjoy this.","8848":"good","8849":"Cool song you must buy. iTunes does not have it yet. Thanks, amazon. Have not heard song in US yet. But Spanish radio plays it quite often. Will be a big hit in Europe and maybe the states.","8850":"Beautiful lyrics, clear voice.  Really love this song.","8851":"Recommended","8852":"This song absolutely sucks.","8853":"Found it on a soundtrack. It is a beautiful song with a great melody. Very ethereal, fell in love as soon as I heard it.","8854":"damnd gingers...","8855":"As always, Red Peters delivers...with a bang! Great Collection on here of funny Christmas songs. Makes Christmas fun again! Along with some great laughs.","8856":"This is just too funny.  It sounds dirty, but isn't and I found it just too funny not to download.","8857":"In listening to inexpensive digital transfers of analog recordings, one notices dramatic variations in quality.  At one extreme there are superb items such as the Puccini Girl of the Golden West with Tebaldi, and at the other extreme is this poor transfer of the fine Forster version of the St. John Passion.  It is the worst I've heard--the sound level is VERY low, and even when the sound is cranked way up, it sounds muddy and unfocused.  It's awful.  I own the old LP Seraphim version from the 70s, which I remembered as sounding excellent.  I pulled out my much played LPs last night to make such I wasn't nuts--in fact, the LPs have beautiful, clear, detailed sound--they're just noisy from having been played a lot.\n\nIMHO Amazon should withdraw this until something is done about the sound.  They'd be better off with a decent version of this for the same price as the 1964 Richter recording, to which it is rather comparable.  It's disgraceful to see this fine performance subjected to such mistreatment.","8858":"Not what I expected. This is an \"unplugged\" version (not the original song you hear on the radio). Wish I had listened to it first.","8859":"don't recognize file format.  tried to download off of mp 3 player doesn't work on my mp3 player not happy","8860":"With a title like \"Do You Remember\" by Jay Sean, one would think this is the hit radio song.  Wrong.  Luckily I always listen to the sample before I download...","8861":"I intended to download the \"Do you remember\" song by Jay Sean and ended up with this mess. Why is this being sold. What a rip off...... So disappointed and I can not return it. If I could give it a zero ranting I would....","8862":"Bought the Album to listen to as Background Music -with long segments\nAlbum had the same vocal song (13.58 minutes) twice under 2 different names\nI am not a fan of Vocals\nEven though the Album had a relatively low price. Still paying twice for anything is no fun","8863":"was looking for the  \"regular\" version, wound up with this...not good","8864":"Inspirational, above Steve Angrisano's \"average.\"  And his \"average\" is one of the best in Contemporary Christian music.","8865":"What's not to love about this cheerful song?","8866":"The last couple of songs on this CD skipped. Was not happy with the Cd..!","8867":"I need to know When received .this Item.please. thanks..nestor. pacheco","8868":"Figure is the bomb","8869":"Love folk music and Eilen Jewell....also spiritual music, a bit on the gospel side.  Violin is great also the harmony.  I like to add a hopeful verse or two.  \"You will never walk alone, your God will walk along, when you lay down your heavy load.","8870":"Great CD, most real good songs on a single CD I've found.","8871":"Wonderful guys and great music. I arrived very fast and in perfect condition. I got it for my husband who loves the song \"The Shade Comes Free With the Tree\".","8872":"I have always been a fan of Monte Pittman's guitar playing. I love the work he has done with Madonna and Adam Lambert. Saw him live on Adam's GlamNation tour. Absolutely fantastic show. Unofortunately, this album, although, showcasing his guitar playing, is not impressive. The songs are indistinguishable. Wishing Monte the best of luck in the future!! Sadly, this just does not do it for me!!","8873":"Monte is a superb guitarist but needs to stick to being a band member and studio musician. His vocals are weak, as is the song writing. The guitar shines!","8874":"Boogies Blues just close your eyes and listen.  Really true Boogies Woogies!","8875":"There is so much more to this western than just John Wayne. It is about the importance of friendship and community. It is about doing what is the best thing even if it is the hardest thing. It is about redemption. It is on my top ten all time\/any time movie list.","8876":"The songs are mostly old with Hisses and extra noise. THE only song worth having for average music lover is My RIFLE, MY PONEY AND ME FROM RIO BRAVO, WHICH IS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD HERE. PLUS NO CD ARGUMENT IS VALID. I THINK BIG TIME DINO FANS HAVE MOST OF OTHE TUNES IN OTHER LP'S AND CD'S. SO JUST BUY ONE SONG, AND YOU'RE BETTER OFF.","8877":"I really wasn't feeling this song.  Sorry, Bey.","8878":"The instrumental is good until the last few seconds where the ending is cut off","8879":"such a good song. it is my favorite and my  friends love it too. The best part is it doesn't have bad words","8880":"Excelent","8881":"Love it.","8882":"Merry Christmas, Not Happy Holidays.","8883":"I bought this for my girlfriend she's a big goth, 80s girl, this CD sorry mr. Murphy , just to mellow.","8884":"This is a very welcome release.\n\nI never thought of Ninth as a full album. Probably because I only found 7 out of 11 songs actually listenable. The others, however, were his best work ever!\n\nAnd thats where this release comes in. Of the 6 songs, one is already on Ninth, and a further 2 are unlistenable. However, the remaining 3, plus the 7 on Ninth, that makes for a full, excellent, 5 out of 5 listening experience.\n\nMost artists record more songs for an album than will actually make the final cut. Because half the songs end up not very good. In the case of Ninth it seems, all the songs made it, but across two releases. I can't say that does him any favours, because a lot of people will listen to an album and think 'wtf?' But we can be thankful we have everything now, and make our own 'perfect album' as we see fit.\n\nMy biggest gripe with Peter's recent solo work is some bad artistic decisions on the vocals. Until recently, his performances were always flawless. Different... but flawless. He has developed the annoying habit of singing entire songs two or three times, then pasting all the vocal tracks on top of each other, slightly out of time, and very out of tune, with some wild warbles thrown in. Backing vocals should be used sparingly, to emphasize important words or add atmosphere, but if its the entire track, it gets confusing on the ear, and sounds over-produced. 'Secret' and 'Secret Silk Society' suffer extraordinarily badly from this.\n\nWhen he sings properly though, he has an excellent voice. And its a voice I like to hear. I can't hear how he sings if its diluted by multiple versions of the same thing. However, the song 'Good Works' suffers none of these problems. The voice is clear, solid, passionate, and haunting. The track is so good that I rated the album 4 instead of 3 on this experience alone. It might become my favourite Peter track of all time.\n\n'Secret' isn't vocally pleasing, but its passable, and the song itself is a tremendous feat of writing. Despite the fact it could have been better, I rate it 4.\n\nThen theres the delicious 'Rose Hunter' track. It shines as a perfect companion to the perfect 'I Spit Roses' of Ninth. It has a similar structure, with vocal humming layered underneath a chorus which cuts suddenly with the word 'lovers!' (as opposed to 'spit!) Perfect. Its sung with great passion, and builds throughout.\n\nAll in all, 4 out of 5, because it completes 'Ninth' perfectly, and now I feel complete. Peter's work has always inspired me, and I'm so relieved that my confidence in his latest album can remain unscathed.","8885":"i love this instrumental. it's different from other songs and it can be soothing. i love the instruments played in the song.","8886":"I guess I was thoroughly confused for I ordered the wrong selection.  Based on the title, I thought it was the correct one.","8887":"A bundle of songs. All good songs if you love Tango.","8888":"Attention Tuck and Patti fans! This is a bootleg cd. It was poorly recorded in 1988-neither the artists or songwriters recieve royalties! Visit Tuck and Patti's web site for confirmation. They will make a live recording one  day-this is not it!","8889":"I purchased this song & it sounded like it was scrached. It skiped stopped & started. I got a refund.\nNot worth bying","8890":"I cannot download nor play this song after I bought it. It charged me for it despite that! Don't buy it or try to play part of the song first before buying just to make sure it works after you buy it.","8891":"Didn't get but one song....very upset","8892":"I think this song first came out on Rob's Tokyo Nights album. I remember hearing it constantly on KKSF in San Francisco and also on The Wave. Very nice moody piano piece, and well recorded.","8893":"Sweet song","8894":"Passion Passion Passion!  Very expressive voice and good to listen to when your own passions are begging to be expressed.  Lovely renditions by Joyce DiDonato and very enjoyable!","8895":"this voice is a discovery, her scenes sung here are masterpieces of belcanto & her voice suites very well to them... never heard of her before this recording, but I was able to hear it before I bought it & I got very positively impressed as Rossini being my favorite opera composer & the one I have more studio recordings of his works, I've been able to year all kinds of voices, in all the roles of his operas.... this one I think is one of the best I've ever heard, at least she's brave on her coloratura & tone","8896":"Nice!","8897":"Partly my fault not to notice picture of record does not have standard 45 large center hole. Unable to use for jukebox. Basically a coaster now. Should be more description of record to alert potential buyer.","8898":"I heard this at a funeral wake and I had to have this although I haven't received my CD yet I'm still listening to the download on my phone","8899":"Indulgence...and not that well thought out indulgence either.  This is my SECOND Roy Meriwether Featuring Houston Person that came up with all Roy...and no Houston P.  Sorry Roy....I bought the track for the Houston sax and feel a bit let down with a little smoke & mirrors on an album that doesn't seem to be willing to feature the legacy sax as advertised.","8900":"I love Christian music. This was just the ticket!!! Now whether or not I am in study or trying to get a little rest, I always have good music to listen too.","8901":"great group and very hard to find groups from this TV show - I ended up purchasing the whole season","8902":"lol 2000 dollars =what a joke","8903":"We play Christmas music non-stop from the day after Thanksgiving to 12th Night and have an extensive library of Christmas music from which to choose.\n\nThis year we choose to seek out new tracks that were either Celtic\/Olde World influenced  OR  weren't simply another rendition of the old standbys.\n\nBarra MacNeils \"The Christmas Album\" and \"The Christmas Album II\" provided some great selections. We chose to buy selected tracks and I'll not comment on those we excluded, only the following tracks which we did indeed purchase.\n\n01 - Children's Winter - three stars\n.....Pleasing, new to most song. Plays better (for me) as a variation after having been listening to other, more familiar or lively songs.\n\n02 - God Rest ye Merry Gentlemen - five stars\n.....A good, traditionalist rendition of a Christmas classic. Gentle vocals, well harmonized and reverently (as is appropriate) performed. Nice 'Celtic' instrumental lead out.\n\n06 - Christmas Comes But Once a Year - four stars\n.....Easily meets the 'Celtic Influence' requirement. A real toe-tapping, corner pub song. Enjoyed by all.\n\n07 - Christmas in Killarney - five stars\n.....Another 'Celtic' selection. One of the two best songs from the disk - Great song, great recording. Great fun, enjoyed by all.\n\n10 - Galacian Carol - three stars\n.....For a non-traditional instrumental, this track plays ok.\n\n11 - O' Come Devine Messiah\n.....If you're looking for a secular, happy holiday track then you need to look elsewhere.\n.....However, if like me your Christmas is a \"Jesus is the reason for the Season\", this is a MUST HAVE track. Multi-part a'capella rendition of an olde world Advent favorite. Perfect.\n\nAll in all we're very happy with the selections from this disc and recommend them '...to one and all'.","8904":"Didn't catch this was an tribute band until after I bought it","8905":"Can I not add this to my own library on my phone? I don't need amazons library!","8906":"Just Ok a very different version  of the original. Bought it because I heard it on the Sons","8907":"amazing song","8908":"Love the melodic beats. Very chill out and relax atmosphere. A little funky, but not too much. A nice way to calm down after a busy day..","8909":"The other reviews on this album are by people who don't like OF or Tyler, The Creator, so I don't know why they even bothered. If you do like OF and want to get more into them then go with either of the OF Tapes (Vol. 1 or 2), these songs aren't bad but they aren't their best work either. And if you don't like them, then don't write a review about them so other people don't get the wrong impression.","8910":"If you think the songs that made it onto their official releases was bad, wait until you hear this. This sounds like a collection of demos that belongs on the rejected pile.","8911":"but maybe its for you!  only 2 bangers that I still listen to.  Their style is definitely intact, just too wild for me I guess","8912":"Great song by the dusters, but amazons file doesn't Does not work !!! Ripoff!!!!","8913":"While the official soundtrack to the game, Might & Magic Heroes VI, is well made and packaged; it was disappointing when I realized that the song from the game trailer (the reason that I bought this soundtrack) is not included. This was a deal breaker for me. It's too bad because the music on the trailer is awesome.\n\nAnyways, there is another odd quirk about this soundtrack. None of the songs have endings. Every song just stops abruptly in mid-stride. I believe it's because these songs are intended to loop indefinitely during game play. However, producers normally provide 'completed' songs on their soundtracks. Nevertheless, this may appeal to some that want to loop the music in the back ground while reading. So, I'll give it one thumb up.","8914":"Even after purchasing this only plays a 28 second clip of the song.","8915":"Made a mistake in earlier review - forgot to hit all the stars. Sorry. The album was great!","8916":"This is an all-time great record!","8917":"I have looked for this song in track for a very long time. I was excited to find it and downloaded it on the spot. Did the song this Christmas eve and got many comments about it (good ones!)","8918":"something new.","8919":"Please, don;t repeat my mistake, listen to a few tracks first. This is an alternative ROCK collection, although the cover and title makes one think, perhaps, it is dance music.\nInteresting stuff, just not what I was expecting. Mostly rote forgettable alt rock. Gypsyblood was ok. Most of this is second tier stuff. But hey, its free, so if you like alt rock you should pick it up.","8920":"Sounds tinny","8921":"The bit rate on this is only 192kps.  Lowest I've seen on a big retailer site.","8922":"Have not heard it","8923":"Warning. This is not AKB48. It's a guy on an organ called \"Super Sparkle\" Really, not very good and as far from J-Pop as you can go.","8924":"This is a great song , and well done by Helen Fenton , but why not available by Dick  Haymes from the original movie ?\nMs. fenton does a commendable version , right timing and rythm, so many others are hurried or use any words that come\ninto mind and that make no sense . This is a smooth sweet version .","8925":"Blue O'Connell - Choose The Sky (Independent)\nIn 2009, after many years suffering loss of hearing, Blue O'Connell had cochlear implant surgery for her left ear and received a new digital hearing aid for her right ear. Since then O'Connell's busied herself teaching music from her unique perspective and recording her new \"Choose The Sky\" album.\n\nShe's a wonderful guitarist, taught by Robert Fripp, no less, and her words are intelligent and moving. You can hear her deafness in her voice, though it's a minor distraction, and combined with gentle finger-picked strings, the effect is always profoundly musical, though not always easy to categorize - like a babbling stream or finger bells, or some ancient `60s free folk design.\n\nNevertheless, her songs follow narratives and are written to share her stories and experiences. The title track, which also opens the album, sets the tone quite brilliantly, and just in case you've not been paying attention, the records ends with \"To Belong\" which features a lyric that pulls no punches whatsoever. In between you'll find much to love, not least instrumental tracks like \"For the Lily Grows\" and \"Owl's Dream\", both of which are just astounding - like hearing a long lost Davy Graham session for the first time.","8926":"Not enough versatility in the selections provided.\nMany selections sound similar, just in different keys.","8927":"Everything put out by Fred is as perfect as perfect can be in this earth. This guy is a genius!!!!!","8928":"Primero, no descargaron todos los temas de los 22 temas que dice tener el lbum. Slo descargaron 8. El lenguaje no es alusivo a la Navidad, y aunque es el ritmo es pegajoso, el lenguaje es muy obsceno.","8929":"Not AKB48. Like a fool, I bought this because it has AKB48 in the title, but it's actually some git on an organ called \"Super Sparkle\". I thought Amazon was pretty good to have a better J-Pop selection than iTunes, but \"Super Sparkle\" and his organ doesn't count.","8930":"Great song!  Great message!","8931":"The very first time I heard this song it struck such a chord in me.  And every time I have listened to it since, its been the same stirring.  The words of the song, showing us the needs of desperate people for the the compassion of Jesus. The video of the different people and nationalities was so moving.  It is a stirring call to all of us who know Jesus, to really see people around us and to be totally free to move in setting the captives free.  Gospel through and through.  Great sound, words and focus!  Still love the song!!","8932":"I'm really disappointed in this track. The preview given and the description didn't say anything about background vocals, so I purchased it. However, the background vocals kick in and don't stop after the first verse. Since I don't like to sing with that, I can't use this track.","8933":"was free","8934":"Got this as part of a free music sampler pack for participating in an Amazon survey somewhat recently, and was disappointed by its contents. This was one of them.","8935":"This song reminds me of the 80's for some reason, and it has many plays on my ipod now! I sing along to it. haha I think you should listen to it just to at least give it a chance.","8936":"Love it.","8937":"Beautiful music-- The albums of Big Band era songs are particular romantic favorites, although the Spanish guitar classical pieces are dramatic and really well done. I can listen to this music all day!","8938":"I have been following the music artist joker and he seem to have a lot of talent and rhythm! I mainly look for a catchy drum beat and a melody that in toxicates! I really like Joker a lot now and will keep looking for more songs to buy! He is a very cool and a very versatile artist!","8939":"The sample sounded very traditional, but as the song progresses its a very contemporary sound. won't be using it, so it was a waste. I down loaded 2 songs and both were like this, so  I won't be trying any more.","8940":"Ella Fitzgerald was a true artist and one of my all-time favorite singers.  Great rendition of \"Tenderly\" is a classic!","8941":"Fun, upbeat song you can easily dance to.","8942":"Ives gives a spirited performance of this folk version of the original Beulah Land. The balance of lead and backup singers fails at times.","8943":"Fantastic intruduction to the Cimbasso. It was soothing yet keep my constant attention. I look forward to more work from this master.","8944":"Well rather new to this unique instrument, I listened to this CD out of curiosity.. I found the sound to be wonderfully beautiful!!  I loved the flow of the music, it was relaxing and romantic!! I strongly recommended buying it !","8945":"At least I got to hear a cimbasso. I would appreciated  more lower register material----","8946":"I like the track.  Just not this version. Hard to top the original version.  But I'm like that with most things.","8947":"Let me start out by saying that the predecessor to this album, A Violent Emotion, is probably one of my five favorite electronic albums, so I didn't expect this to be able to top it.  However, I never expected it to fall so short, either.\n\nThe first track, 'A Nice Place to Visit', kicks off the album rather abruptly with a harsh scream over a pounding beat, but it's pretty much downhill from there.  As soon as the main vocals started I immediately knew this album was going to be a disappointment.  I loved the vocal style on AP's first two albums, but I have to say that on this release they are much hollower and far too weak to pack the same aggression as before.  I read a review somewhere that joked about Daniel Graves having his vocal chords replaced with a frog's, and honestly I can't think of a better way to describe it.\n\n  Then the clean vocals start and made me want to stop listening altogether.  On AVE, the clean vocals were well planned, strong, and worked to perfection.  I honestly don't know what to think about them on this album (see example the title track...), but they seem out of place (and in the wrong genre).  I definitely would consider them a bad move.\n\n  Lest you think the shift in vocal style is my only reason for giving this album a 2\/5 (I would rather have given it a 1.5, but that's not possible so...), rest assured I have more problems with it.  The melodies and synth lines are dull and repetitive, sounding like slightly harsher cookie-cutter riffs from some dance track.  The music itself seems to have lost most of its edge, just like the vocals.\n\n  Overall, when listening to this album I continually get the sense that the songs are trying so hard to be as dark, aggressive, and energetic as the cover art would suggest, but in the end they just fall short in every way.  If I had to pick a favorite track, it would probably be 'The Devil's in the Details', as it reminds me of 'Spit It Out', the opening track from AVE.  Honestly, if you're a fan of AP, be prepared for a disappointment, and if you're not a fan (yet) I strongly urge you to start with AVE or the first album Close to Human.  Both are far better than this one.","8948":"Love it! Bought two more for my nieces and nephews. A super fun way for children to memorize bible verses. Three year old and 8 year old love this cd!","8949":"Not exactly what I expected.","8950":"No one sang like Dusty Springfield.  She was one of a kind, and the duet with Burt Bacharach was fabulous.  It is too bad she never recorded it in a studio to drown out the audience, but it is an awesome recording.","8951":"I love this song Burt Bacharach starts it out very slow playing just the piano , but then Dusty joins in with her trademark voice and more blonde locks than I've ever seen . This song was never on any of her studio albums , or on any collections or best of CD . You will find it only on this DVD that's how rare a gem this is .","8952":"Not the same rhythm or orchestration","8953":"I've been a Gloria fan ever since the release of \"Eyes of Innocence\" and \"Primitive Love\" (credited to Miami Sound Machine), and I've observed Gloria mature over the decades, and I've grown a huge fan of the latin music scene (and culture) thanks to her. However, having admired great song like Words Get in the Way, Conga, Oye Mi Canto, Here We Are, Cuts Both Ways, Can't Stay Away from You, Rhythm is Gonna Get you, Destiny, Steel Your Heart, I'm Not Giving You Up, Mi Tierra, Oye, Cuba Libre, Wrapped, Te Amare', No Me Dejes De Querer, Ay Ay Ay Amor, No Llores, and many others, I can't help but say that this album has nothing worth listening to. Gloria might be reaching out for the younger generations, but she is definitely losing some of her old fans. So, let's wait and see how the album does on the market. If sales are good then she has done a smart move to survive, and there will be no harm in losing some old fans on the way. If sales are bad, then she will have lost both.\nP.S. Wepa is the most irritating song I've ever heard.\nLet's Get Loud is a total waste of time and money. Absolutely no point in doing this cover of JLo's song.","8954":"Poor sound quality and missing songs (e.g. Happy Easter).  We always enjoy this Irving Berlin favorite, but the producers didn't do a very good job.","8955":"This is NOT a review:  it is a warning that what is described as \"Original Motion Picture Soundtrack:  The Band Wagon (Digitally Remastered)\n\nDOES NOT HAVE THE CORRECT SONGS ON MP3'S\n\nEXAMPLE:  NUMBER ONE IS \"OLD MAN RIVER.\"!!\n\nAND \"DANCING IN THE DARK\" IS ANOTHER SONG ALTOGETHER!

It is a blessing! !!","8958":"place order believing that i could listen to the entire album song,but was only  forone song","8959":"Let me start out by saying that the predecessor to this album, A Violent Emotion, is probably one of my five favorite electronic albums, so I didn't expect this to be able to top it. However, I never expected it to fall so short, either.\n\nThe first track, 'A Nice Place to Visit', kicks off the album rather abruptly with a harsh scream over a pounding beat, but it's pretty much downhill from there. As soon as the main vocals started I immediately knew this album was going to be a disappointment. I loved the vocal style on AP's first two albums, but I have to say that on this release they are much hollower and far too weak to pack the same aggression as before. I read a review somewhere that joked about Daniel Graves having his vocal chords replaced with a frog's, and honestly I can't think of a better way to describe it.\n\nThen the clean vocals start and made me want to stop listening altogether. On AVE, the clean vocals were well planned, strong, and worked to perfection. I honestly don't know what to think about them on this album (see example the title track...), but they seem out of place (and in the wrong genre). I definitely would consider them a bad move.\n\nLest you think the shift in vocal style is my only reason for giving this album a 2\/5 (I would rather have given it a 1.5, but that's not possible so...), rest assured I have more problems with it.

We don't have a musician or choir director so I buy Instrumentals at Amazon and play at church services on Sundays. The congregation and the few choir members really enjoy being able to worship thru singing with the purchased songs.","8961":"Great beat and mixed vocals.  Quickly becoming my favorite band especially with the lead singers vocal range.","8962":"Hey, buy this, it's only $1.\n\nIt's an earlier version of \"Maybelline Grease,\"\nnot the same version on Larry Buys A Lighter.\n\nAnd, get Larry Buys A Lighter.\nBeen listening to Ramsay since circa 2003 or so.\nLarry Buys is a bad mofo of an album.\nMy favorite of his, easily.\n\nJust great to spin every day.","8963":"I bought this music selection for my daycare. I wanted music to get them moving. These songs are great. The children dance and move to selections such as the hokey pinkie and the freeze dance. They really enjoy it and so do I. We all get a great workout.","8964":"I met this character sever times before his death on the eve of larger stardom on TV.  His Divine characterization was hysterical and frightening at the same time.  Miss you tons you fearless star.  Eat S--- and LIVE!","8965":"This release is not without its virtues. The sound is excellent, as is the orchestral work (listen, for example, to the growling lower strings at the end of the first movement of K. 491). There are also some rather interesting cadenzas here, paricularly Faure's fascinating (if anachronistic) cadenza in K. 491. The booklet notes are fine. The author points to the dramatic operatic qualities of the works, paricularly the aria-like quality of the slow movements. And these are the qualities missing from these neat, prettified performances. A friend of mine once aptly observed that Mozart pianissimos should never sound like Chopin's, which is precisely what Primakov's soft-focused playing suggests. To my ears the softness of his touch combined with a reluctance to play anything above a piano produces deadly results. I started with K. 491, and the first movement went reasonably well.  The trouble began with the slow movement, played at a somewhat slow tempo (no problem) and at exactly the same muted dynamic level throughout. It sounded like cocktail music to me. The finale was also slow and also lacking in drama. The beautiful dialogue for piano and oboe made almost no impression because it sounded just like everythinjg else in the movement. For comparison, I turned to Richard Good's excellent performance with Orpheus. What a contrast Goode's clear, focused sound was to Primakov's dreamy tinkling. Still, this performance was superior to that of K. 503.  Once again, the opening movenment was satisfactory.  But the last two movements were awful. The slow movement is \"dreamy,\" the trills barely audible, and any operatic quality entirely lost. The finale was dreadfully dull, with Primakov playing one passage after another without the slightest sparkle or drama. I was disheartened, but I went on and found the last two concertos equally sweet, pretty, and boring. Judging from the excellent reviews this release has received it seems that many people like their Mozart played this way. For such listeners, the present release can be safely recommended, for Primakov's playing is unfailingly \"beautiful.\" But if you like your Mozart played with passion and drama, you should go elsewhere.","8966":"Only one song, but it sure is my favorite. Like to start the evening off with this. Gets my guests up and dancing","8967":"Beautiful","8968":"Just got a copy of the Darrow Chemical Company CD \"A Nightmare on Seventh Avenue\".  This album is very refreshing as it does not follow the mold of current music; be it punk rock or other genres.  In this digital age, recording all sounds the same but this album has character both with the actual song writing and the recording.\n\nThis album is well thought out with lyric writing, music\/riff structure, and packaging.  If you ever want to listen to some punk rock music with its own feel and tells a great hard-luck story, this is for you!!!!","8969":"Makes me nervous.","8970":"wasn't impressed, uninstalled the app","8971":"Kids love it.","8972":"I saw them in S.F. last year without ever even hearing of them. They are just awesome! Buy this single and all thier albums!","8973":"I saw The Still Voice at the anti-pop music festival years ago in Orlando and was hooked. They made a few other appearances locally and put out an EP a bit prior to this album, but sadly split up soon after. The music is fuzzy, rocky, trip-hoppy, complex, and occasionally reminiscent of the Kidney Thieves (maybe with a somewhat grittier texture). Erin Solari is a fantastic vocalist, and I'm hoping her upcoming solo project picks up where this album left off.","8974":"This song is quite bad. There was a music video for it on YouTube in which Mark Weber defaced an entire cemetery's worth of tombstones with his fists. It's since been taken down due to complaints of those who have loved ones resting in the particular area Mark filmed the video. He has no qualms about disturbing the dead. Guy's been wandering.","8975":"I just really like this song.","8976":"Love Bruno Mars","8977":"Man this guy sucks. Two super bowls ruined by him? Please NFL get ur stuff together.","8978":"Love it. . . Love it .... Great CD .. Glad I found it, was looking for this CD for over a year! Play it all the time. Thank you","8979":"If there is a song worse then this one released this year then I have yet to hear it.  The entire song is just ridiculous.  From Jeremih phoning in the chorus, to the beat that sounds just slightly  off, to the weird voice that Plies is using throughout the song, Just The Tip wreaks of awfulness.  The content is also asinine (or in the words of Stephen A. Smith.....asitwelve). I can't even believe Ludacris agreed to this feature.  He must have been drunk,high, or got a fat check but even so he sounds very uninspired...and really who could blame him???  This song doesn't deserve to exist let alone be sold for anything other than free.  Horrible.","8980":"GO Diamond Club <><><><><><><> T.I.B.  Uncle Bilbo. Have forwarded to other people.

I have fun giving it a go, however, at my young age things seems difficult at times. But, I\/m determined to get this thing. I enjoy it.","8986":"Just what we needed for the party","8987":"Simple packaging,,, duplicating all the album cover exterior artwork. A huge selection of Leonard Cohen in a small campact package. My partner was & is thrilled.","8988":"do not like this version","8989":"This is an excellent (although no longer published) CD which will help you memorize three chapters in the Book of Romans using several songs that are easy on the ears. Got one years ago, but this one I just got has better sound quality.","8990":"My students love these songs!  I figure, hey, they aren't teaching this stuff in class anymore, why not at least give it to them during music time?  They remember more by song anyway!  Catchy beats and cool rap style makes you hip with the kids!","8991":"This isn't the original as in the one on YouTube and that the the music video is played to.

I was a fan of his work on the Mass Effect 2 sound track, but was made aware of this album after Desert Bus for Hope 5.  I've been listening to it ever since and have relished it's nostalgic feel.  Authentic 8-bit feel is hard to capture, but Jimmy gets it in it's most basic form, and the remixes are in such rare form that they rival the top of the pop lists.  I would buy this album again in a heartbeat for all it's energy and the journey that it took me on as a listener.","8999":"Excellent!!!!","9000":"I bought the CD and it arrived at my house quickly, but the case was damp and the colours were distorted.\nI honestly do not want to buy another $17 dollar CD, but I will.

I just had to down load it to my mp3 player.","9002":"I was surprised because I didn't know what I got either because I didn't read what came with the price or most likely I thought I was getting an album with several songs. I love the sound of his voice.  I want more of his songs.  This purchase had one song with 4 different mixes.  One song only.  It's a great song but only one.  :\/","9003":"The music is uplifting, anointed and pleasing to the ear.  I wish I had this music earlier in the year when I hosted a brunch.","9004":"Wow, this song is really inspiring and can really help one rock out during a workout!\nThe song\/album cover, well....I wonder if this guy gets any chicks - I mean what's up with the stained shirt?

The fusion of the saxophone and bass guitar really make this song nothing short of blissful.","9006":"Viva la Revolucin!\nRockin' new album by New World Revolution featuring some of the energizing songs from their album Karmakaze and also features some kick ass remixes.

Didn't like the music & couldn't hear the voices when they did talk. played it twice & will give it away","9010":"I use hearing aids and some of the dialog is difficult to get but I really enjoy this sound and message.","9011":"When I listened to the sample I didn't realize it was rap","9012":"Love every minute of this song, highly recommend.  I use the music for my yoga classes and works great - so relaxing and keeps the beat to keep moving.","9013":"Love this one for my yoga classes.

Excellent song and lyrics.","9046":"If I could have put 100 stars I would have.  The lyrics of this song are so perfect that I chose it as the song for the Mother\/Son dance at my son's recent wedding.  I wanted something with a very specific message and this song fit the bill in so many ways.  The lyrics, the music, the performance\nall were fantastic.  Thanks so much to Rascal Flatts for helping me send a very important message to my son on his wedding day.","9047":"I'm sure I will enjoy this product if I ever get to listen to it.

Such powerful lyrics with a memorable voice to match. Great release you're sure to love.","9068":"Totally funny way to get a camp full of hunters up and scrambling.  Play it through your trucks audio system and you will think there is a fire in every splleping place.  Works better than the smell of coffee.","9069":"I love this song. So bluesy and it gives praises to the Holy Spirit.","9070":"TERRIFIC!!","9071":"Unique sound and original music.  I wish more Christian bands where this talented.  Sadly most Christian music sounds like Chris Tomlin or Mercy Me. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.  Their music makes you want to get up and move.","9072":"This audio sound was approx. 1 minute. I thought it was longer and I was going to use it as a sleep inducer. Big rip off.","9073":"Like all of their work, it's amazing! One of my all time favorite bands! Thanks guys for your God inspired music and all of your hard work! Come back!","9074":"This is actually only 1 audio clip that is forty six (46) SECONDS long (not minutes).","9075":"Fantastic harmony, with beautiful worship theme in the song called \"Mary, Did You Know?\"  Very moving words in this song called \"Mary Did You Know?\".","9076":"shouting song","9077":"I truly enjoy listening & worshipping to music by Tremaine Hawkins and \"HOLY ONE\" is my all time favorite song by her.","9078":"This track was a perfect accompaniment for my slideshow of pictures from a trip to Italy. The length was perfect because I had so many pictures to get through.","9079":"Maybe chillout\/lounge music has to be monotonous as such, but this album takes it to the extreme. One single chord streched up to 6 mintues, without any highlights or surprises for all tracks. All \"artists\" from Cane Garden Bay records try to show their skills which rather ends being embarassing as all of them sound equal and equally boring.\nThe whole chillout\/lounge music scene suffers from such wannabe artists with their dilettantish sequencer playing. I doubt any of them even knows why the black keys are there on their keyboards.","9080":"Great set! Album in tip top condition.","9081":"For some reason, this remaster sounds too fast.  Such\n\na 5 star album with a 2 star cd remaster.  Buy the album\n\nto hear it the way Jeff Beck wanted it recorded.","9082":"Aorta - Blood........  While this groups first album of the late 60's was\n\ngreat ..... this one sounds like a group of very poor musicians trying\n\nto copy Frank Zappa's style.  It was a complete waste of money and\n\nnot worthy of your time!","9083":"Its just a drum accompaniment. Nothing else. Not worth purchasing!","9084":"Alvin has a gift from God that will inspire you as he does me.  There are many great singers, and then there is Alvin. Enough said!","9085":"I'm a down Juggalo, but not a fan of this.","9086":"I love \"trouble so hard\" in the original folk version or the Moby version as Natural Blues.  This music bears no relation to the song I can see... a bunch of hissing turntable flipping, no song, no melody.  If you want some techno club music that just sounds generic and unidentifiable, it's OK.  I didn't.  After nothing happened for 3 minutes I fast forwarded through it, nothing ever happened as far as I heard.  I wasted $1.59.  The only time I have bought something on Amazon that was nothing like I expected.\n\nIf you know the performers and what they do, maybe you'll love it.  If you want the title song, you won't.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nOK, I missed it.  The vocal from \"Trouble So Hard\" starts at 3:26 and runs more or less straight until about 4:17, then resurfaces garbled until about 4:27, then is there under the overlay of club music to about 6:00.  So about 1\/4 of the track has apparently a copy of Vera Hall's recording of \"trouble so hard\" in it.  After listening to it a half dozen times, it's sort of growing on me..but I start at 3:26.  I'd still much rather have a straight recording of \"trouble so hard\" instead of some of the song wrapped over around and under with club music, but since the sample piece was club music, it's my fault.  Anyway, that's what you get!","9087":"There are much better versions of this song.  This one is not good.  The concert they did with Earth Wind and Fire was so much better.","9088":"Shirley Murdock opens this recording ministering from Rev 4:4,10-11 according to the NKJV Bible translation.

They're all gone now, but the songs live on.  It is nice to hear new renditions of tunes like this.  It brings back many fond memories.

This is what symphonic metal is all about","9105":"I cannot figure out Finnissy. His is winding seemingly disheveled and dissonant music with little obvious structure. Certainly his music is more intended as impression rather than developmental progression. This is supported by there being no format: no sonata, no quartet, no concerto, no symphony, etc. Simply pieces that do not connect with any other movements.\n\nThere are bases of logic to the works, however clouded and non-relatable to the layman as they are. Traum des Sangers is based upon a sketch by Caspar David Friedrich depicting a sleeping muse and angels above him. The notes say that the work represents this as two sound worlds, one of the real dreamer, the other of the surreal\/unreal celestial element, oddly with the latter musical unit being more clearly structured (more real) than the former. The notes ask \"Who is dreaming who?\". The piece entitled WAM, which are the initials of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, reportedly works fragments of several of Mozart's works which are distorted, though they are so distorted that I can hear none of it. The liner notes refer to several quotes of Mozart: \"In order to be a success one would write stuff that is so inane a carthorse could sing it, or so unintelligible no sensible person could be bothered to work it out\", etc. These quotes represent existential struggles that Finnissy grappled with, whether Mozart was always great, the end-all-be-all one who intimidates composers who follow.  This all suggests that Finnissy was grappling with the accessibility of his own music. But all this results in a piece that is lethargic and aimless music. Mars + Venus considers a Reubens painting of the same name, featuring a man and woman. Finnissy apparently then considers the Mars and the Venus (apparently because of the male-female dichotomy) within us, which are not separable but interact and add. So the piece warps feelings of war and love, again as some non-forward moving, non-developing cloud.\n\nThere are numerous discs available with Finnissy's music. So somebody in the academic music community likes him. But you have to ask the age-old question of music: who is it for? Intellectual insiders, or the greater world? Or does an artist create out of what he\/she needs to say, without regard to anything else? Certainly the latter is a given. But then don't expect the public to come along. As a layman, I found this disc unsatisfying with nothing that was said understood.","9106":"DONT BUY THIS CD... IT MAKES U WANNA DO BAD THINGS....PUT STUFF UP YOUR NOSE AND  KICK IT WITH YOUR NEIGHBORS WIFE LIKE ME.","9107":"I love it el cartel de Santa but when I ordered these cd I thought it was the sincopa 5.1 like the picture but it was just sincopa the cd was 30 dollar I could get it in the store for 10 that's why I don't recommend to by this cd","9108":"Great deal, sounds terrific. Fast shipping","9109":"Love the songs","9110":"Not a full song","9111":"I like de son the Marseillaise Hymne National Francais.","9112":"IF YOU DONT OWN THIS ALBUM YOU ARE MISSING OUT.

IF YOU DONT OWN IT FIND WHERE YOU CAN AND BUY IT.","9113":"in spite of the fact in the beginning I can hear footsteps, it's just ok","9114":"Very disappointing cd. Would not recommend it even though I love his voice. The arrangements are quite boring.","9115":"I was hoping for passion, songs to make my soul sing, but it's just too mellow.  He's got a wonderful voice but this album doesn't do it justice.  I was so disappointed and will never listen to it after I forced myself to do it the first time.","9116":"I really love this mantra, and I put it on \"repeat\". The track is beautifully sung, with great accompaniment. I highly recommend this if you like the Sat Siri Siri Akaal mantra.","9117":"The voice of Wintley Phipps deeply inspires  me to listen to the words he sings. Many if the songs I have heard before, but never with such a spirit of conviction and truth.  I really like his rendering of each song.","9118":"This was such a jazzy little gem. So very infectious. They did a great job arranging this music and the jazz part was perfect, not too much and not too little. Makes me smile and think of a perfect day. Wonderful!","9119":"At last there is a decent recording available of Bernard Herrmann's masterpiece: Moby Dick. It's been a long time coming but it is well worth the wait.\n\nThe singers chosen for the solo parts (Ishmael\/Ahab) are highly skilled (a requirement for this work). But they also add a strong stamp of character, making the music vividly alive. We can sympathize with Ishmael's wonder and amazement; we shiver with horror and awe at Ahab's ravings; and the tragic role of Starbuck brings tears to our eyes with its stunning pathos. This isn't just a recording - it is a performance. An excellent program of a very difficult piece of music. You will have a new respect for Bernard Herrmann after listening to this.\n\nThis reviewer has the opportunity to study the original score in the Herrmann archives at Santa Barbara. This is not an easy piece to play and demands a high quality of player and conductor. The Danish National Orchestra and Choir more than meet those requirements. Under the leadership of conductor Schonwandt, the ensemble delivers an electrifying rendition that holds you spellbound through the entire work. This is not a dull, run of the mill product. Not in the least.\n\nThe quality of the recording is just as stunning as the performance: the sounds are clear, powerful, and well defined. It is a pleasure to listen to at all levels.\n\nBy all means, if you are a fan of Herrmann's film scores, don't miss this opportunity to hear one of his best off-screen creations. It is a shame that we had to wait more than 36 years after the composer's death to hear it - but it is well worth the wait.","9120":"It almost goes without saying that this version lacks the authority and \"definitive\"ness of the original recording, since that was conducted by the composer. Who, unlike a lot of composers, was as good with a baton as a stave, if not better, especially with 20th century music. As an example, Bennie was doing Ives long before that Bernstein fellow kicked off the Ives rush in the late 60's. But the performances here are close enough to the original for chemistry (as my physicist friends say) and the sound is far better--clearer and with xlnt dynamic range. I tried 3 different LP's of the original and the big tuttis (particularly the Amen) overloaded the grooves of every one. Turned out the main problem was the master tape because the CD wasn't much better. This one is.","9121":"When one studies the foundation of a religion, it is best to approach it from a believer's perspective. This helps one to understand why one follows the faith. It also strips away from misapprehension. This mp3 has been created by someone who opposes Islam and has several passages full of condescending, patronising and misleading information about the religion.\nIf you wish to listen to an audiobook, i would recommend the foundations of Islam by Hamza Yusuf. A noted scholar with over 20 years of studying the principles of his faith and widely regarded as one of the foremost American Muslim scholars in history.","9122":"Unless something is missing from the recording, its only a repitition of beats - not the single song I paid for.","9123":"Common 4-ever","9124":"Jeremy McComb is a fine young singer songwriter, and this is a good follow up to his fabulous first effort My Side of Town! My ONLY quibble is that one of my favorite songs, 5 to Midnight, has a hidden gem - but there is an *11* minute gap to that bonus track.  LOVE She Doesn't Sing!  Nice job, Jeremy!","9125":"One of the best albums by far","9126":"Great song!","9127":"Was scratched, a shame because the music is good.\nI should have known better to buy a vinyl!!!","9128":"Disappointed. WANTED to hear cararies singing.","9129":"Disappointed","9130":"The music is very moving and thought provoking for those of us who have missionaries out in the field, or are raising future missionaries.  Bought sheet music so a few men can perform \"Children Go\" at another young man's farewell.  I highly recommend this!","9131":"Repetitious.  Really wasn't interested in the life story included.","9132":"I like Scotty McCreery and was happy when he won American Idol. I purchased this CD expecting to hear more good songs  from Scotty, however it was a big disappointment. The song selection was  repetitive, with no outstanding cuts on the CD, and Scotty's singing was the same....boring. Purchasing this CD was a waste of money\/","9133":"Thought it was something else but it sounds good","9134":"I began hearing of this cat through his work with the late nujabes..and I was impresses with what I heard. So I decided to look for some his work, And I stumbled across this album before it was released I knew it was definitely A must pick up. since I Like to collect instrumentals this was a no brainier long live real hip-hop!!!","9135":"Fantastic","9136":"love it","9137":"This album, and Vomitron's other, \"NESessary Evil,\" are my favorite video game music albums.  The hard rock\/metal arrangements, musicianship, and technical proficiency are all impressive.  They are both very worthy buys for any fan of hard rock\/metal and 8-bit Nintendo.","9138":"It is an awesome song, can't wait for the album's release.","9139":"Mixed by ace Posh Boy engineer David Hines, this is the newly remastered. re-titled 1981 release of the Posh Boy album \"Illusions of Grandeur\", not the earlier version of poorly mastered, rougher mixes re-issued in Italy.\n\nArtwork by Mark Vallen.","9140":"okay","9141":"Christian Mc Bride and Eddie Palmieri.","9142":"I absolutely love this.  Not your typical cookie cutter pop song.  Siobhan sings from the heart with alot of emotion and you can tell this song is very personal to her.  She has such an incredible voice.  This is Siobhan's homage to Edward Gorey, a Cape Cod writer and illustrator of whimsically macabre books.\n\nShe's releasing her full album on Oct. 30th. I can't wait.

These cuts probably only appeal to scorching guitar enthusiasts, but they are fun listening.  I particularly like the second cut \"Look Up There\" for the slow build up.  To my ear the solo sounds like an extended version of Jimi Hendrix's classic rendition of Bob Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\".  The first cut is also good but doesn't have the full 20-minute build.","9149":"Wow. This is a good one that Amazon recommended and freebied to me. Most songs are loud and heavy in the manner of Nirvana, Kyuss, Stone Temple Pilots and maybe some more metal and even acoustic mayhem thrown in for good order. I'm definitely going to check out some of these bands because most have that tone that I strive for-that warm midrange growl and purr. This is maybe the best Amazon free sampler yet. Good Job.","9150":"Great download","9151":"Great memorize reminds me when I was in high school started  going out with girls and going out to concerts and partying all night long with this music blasting from my camaro.","9152":"great worship","9153":"I found Charles Bradley, completely by accident. I wa watching an episode of Suits on USA and he was playing in the background. Thanks to Shazaam i was able to learn who the artist was. Then by another happy accident i was searching through Amazon Prime and saw a documentary about him called Soul Of America. I recommend that you watch it and it will give you a better perspective on the song and this man's struggles to \"make it in America\"","9154":"No as expected Could be better not like the country song - doesn't seem the same - Paul Hardcastle could of cone better","9155":"Great song. I enjoy listening to it. First heard the song on the movie (\"Courageous\"). Great Christian Faith movie!

The music and lyrics are beautiful, and the melody is calming and wonderful.\n  Rose Angelica is a wonderful Teacher\/ songwriter who writes about the people she knows and her life experiences.  She is a great musician and playes guitar on all her recordings.\n  Get her new CD  \"Girls Just Wanna Drink Beer\"  available on Amazon as a CD or  mp3 download.  Great party music!","9161":"My son loves it","9162":"Techy as hell, love it.","9163":"Absolutely intriguing and proficient. This CD is sick! Drummer, Guitar and Bass all in a different stratosphere yet amazingly tight and brutal. Players should be totally intrigued at this musical journey and prog metal\/avant-garde fans will be intrigued. Time changes, solo's and just pure mayhem are released. Just like the debut yet more intense. Amazing musicianship on display throughout.\nBelieve it. buy it. True avant-garde stuff here. Very entertaining overall.\nYou will be awed","9164":"Beautiful music.  My dad loved this gift.  We purchased more of Alain's music.

I was really disappointed.  Every tune is done by the same group with the same instruments and they all sound the same.  I'm sorry I bought this.","9168":"This has to be one of the most joyful songs I have ever heard.  Such inspiration fills my heart, mind and spirit while listening to this awesome track.  Lisa Gerard has such a beautiful voice.  I am accustomed to listening to it in slower, sadder songs, but this one is a nice break from that.  Orbital does a great job of building up the joy of the song and showcasing this wonderful singer's voice.","9169":"Love David Gray","9170":"This is the second disc of the 4-CD Sensual Classics by George Mann that I've reviewed and, as before, it's an uneven collection.  While he get's a couple of the pieces spot on (more than on Disc 3), mostly the performances are lacking in emotion or flawed.  If you're not expecting much considering the price, you may not be disappointed.  Schumann's Romance:  you don't feel Schumann's romance for Clara Wieck, his soon-to-be bride, for whom this piece was likely written.  Poulenc's Les chemins d'amour:  pleasant, but lacking in charm.  Beethoven's Adagio cantabile from Pathtique Sonata:  this is described as a grand expansive movement.  While the performance has its moments, it lacks grandness or expansiveness.  The approach is mostly lacking in heart.  Puccini's Doretta's Dream from La Rondine:  fails to conveys the notion of true love & passion.  Tchaikovsky's None but the Lonely Heart:  lacks the depth of melancholy this song is known for.  Grieg's The Last Spring from Two Elegaic:  lacks the heartbreak on seeing the season of rebirth colored by the possibility that the viewer may not live to see another.  Massennet's Elegie:  strikes the right note here.  Mascagni's Intermezzo from Cavelleria rusticana:  beautiful serene piece played too heavy handed.  Chopin's Prelude No. 15 in D-Flat Major:  low notes lack clarity.  Piano almost sounds like an organ.  Brahm's Waltz in A-flat Major, Op. 39, No. 15:  OK, has some dance-like rhythm to it.  Rachmoninoff's Variation No. 18 from Rhapsody on a Theme from Paginini:  best cut on CD.  Bizet's Habaera from Carmen:  OK.  Has some rhythm and variety of touch.  Ravel's Pavane for a Dead Princess:  fine.  Mozart's Romanze from Andante from Eine kleine Nachtmuzik:  lacking in Viennese suavity.  Satie's Lent et douloureaux from Trois Gymnopedies:  appropriately dreamy.","9171":"It was terrible and no i wouldn't buy it again!","9172":"Bought this to train my parakeet and it is NOT a pleasant sounding bird song at all. Sounds kind of like a screeching alarm.","9173":"The disc is often unplayable.  It may take four tries to get it started.\n\nInstead of a beautiful bird song, it sounds harsh.  It was not what I anticipated.","9174":"Only one song on this CD and the worst I have ever heard.\nMy Canary is NOT sing with this CD playing.","9175":"This was not the songs of a singing canary we were expecting.  Not pleasant to listen to and probably will never play it again.","9176":"Listen for yourself...... and you be the judge. Great words, great voice, try the sample if you havn't heard the song before.","9177":"This is one of the best Dawes songs. The lead singer has never been one who could carry a tune all that well, but in this one, with the help of the band, they manage to pull off a song that is catch and cool.","9178":"One of the most emotional and personal songs Shelby has ever penned. It is powerfully performed..and confirms S. Lynne's status as a great\nsong writer and performer..","9179":"This song has been in a number of different movie and tv shows. My favorite is the girl next door.","9180":"This singer's voice is so soothing and relaxing, perfect to listen to in the background, but I also love listening to her when I'm driving","9181":"If you like raw, rough, unpolished music, you'll probably like this version. I prefer the original album version. The recording quality is not great...sort of like sitting in the back row would be in a big auditorium. BUT MMJ is a great band.","9182":"Great song. Great band. I love My Morning Jacket and think this is one of their best songs. First heard it on \"American Dad\"","9183":"There are several versions of this song, and you cant tell 1 from the other with the extremely limited preview Amazon offers. Will NOT do this again!","9184":"This album is many things, and all of them are good. The music is a wonderful mix of dark, humorous, clever and sweet. Lyrics are witty and often twisted, taking the listener in surprising directions. I listen to this album fairly often and it always pleases. I don't know why these very talented performers are not more well known,though it may be due to their free-ranging storylines that won't sit well with certain mainstream listeners. But if you're discriminating and open-minded, buy this album, there is much goodness here.","9185":"not what I expected","9186":"Not the best recording and the sound comes and goes.\nDon't  spent your money on this one!","9187":"Excellent Music!  Good Dancing music!","9188":"PK's album is fantastic! This has been on my wish list for a while, but I finally bought it and it was a good choice. They sound a bit like Lecrae on the \"Rehab\" album because they helped him with a few beats, but I love \"Irregular\", \"Don't Wanna Go Back\" and \"Gravity\". Great effort, worth a listen.","9189":"Its includes lots of \"crowd screaming\". Not pure Rodrigo y Gabriela music ecstasy. Please don't buy this if you are a fan.","9190":"This CD is a fantastic example of the fine musicians that the University of Missouri has to offer.  The groove is deep; the arrangements are thick; and the compositions are brilliant.  Arthur White leads this young band to a place that most University ensembles never knew existed.  The guest musicians are top-notch.  I would rate this album with the best that 2011 has to offer the world of jazz.\nBravo, Mizzou!","9191":"Cool Tone","9192":"Great theme song from \"High Noon.\" The words are slightly different in this version-there is no mention of Frank Miller-but it is excellent all the same.  Sound quality is pretty good for a recording this age.","9193":"beautiful theme","9194":"Never received ring tone","9195":"Very touching song","9196":"never received ring tone","9197":"stinky excerpt from the movie with a badly dubbed Ann Blythe before the glorious Vic sings a hollow sounding version of his signature anthem.","9198":"Very good music i love amazon the best song I have good good chino y nacho from Venezuela got to be","9199":"I usually buy books from Amazon and music from iTunes.  His was the first time I bought a song from Amazon. I did it because iTunes did not have it and I wanted it so badly... I found to my surprise that it is totally compatible with iTunes. I can listen to it in my iPod, have it in my Samsung phone and in any computer.  And I also got access to several other songs which I found quite nice.\nAnd of course, Chino y Nacho music is quite good!","9200":"I'm a fan of the original song by the Foo Fighters and Cherri Bomb's cover does an exceptional job capturing the feel of the song. If you're a fan of the original and like a strong female singer this song is a good purchase.","9201":"Wow! Beautiful! Soulful! Perfect singing! Perfect production!!!! What more can I say???","9202":"Good cut to sit back and relax to.  Glad to know that there are artists out there like Lalah that provide music that makes you feel good after listening as opposed to coming down with a severe migraine.  Keep the hits coming Lalah!","9203":"This is not Maria Callas but her teacher Elvira de Hidalgo. This is an old recording of Callas' Spanish teacher.","9204":"I agree with some of the previous reviews- this arrangement is simply my favorite version of Carol of the Bells ever released.  I absolutely love this song, and don't mind listening to it any time of the year.  Combine this song with \"Santa Will Find You\" and you've got an awesome Christmas two-fer.  Awesome work by both Robert Prizeman as well as all of the boys.  Bravo!","9205":"Wasn't the last album a greatest hits too? Oh yea but it was with a symphony so that's different. C'mon Gordon, don't get lazy in your old age. Start writing some music again. I love your old stuff but I refuse to pay for another version of \"Message in a Bottle\" or what ever spin your or your record company puts on your old music. How sad is it when tickets to his show are selling for 3 bucks on stubhub. I guess I'm not alone in not wanting to pay for the same stuff over and over. So please, new music, and soon.","9206":"Unique sound but nothing short of awesome!  This rocks the house, my car and wherever I am!!  Thanks Chevelle!  Keep it up!","9207":"Outstanding collection of some of Burl Ives' best works.  Most Burl Ives albums released over the past ten - twelve years are just compilations of misc junk that don't go together well.  Most don't even have a consistent volume level and you end up having to adjust the volume song by song.  Not the case with this 2 CD collection.  Plays perfectly with no volume level changes.  Highly recommend for Burl fans.","9208":"Gotta love KJ he is funny & sarcastic but so true and you can really learn from some of his songs and it appeals to all types of people!","9209":"Gotta love a man like KJ who stands up for what he believes in  ad what he stands for no matter what","9210":"kj-52 is the dude you wanna hear he is awesome one of a kind rapper who stands for positive things","9211":"I love this guy he is so cool and what he raps about is so true so honest and so good","9212":"As far as I know, this BDAA 2007 Festival of Russian Music CD, available at Amazon, contains the only commercially available digital recording of Vera Gorodovskaya's exquisite \"At Dawn\" (a.k.a. \"At Dawn, Sweet Dawn\"), which I first heard on the 1970 vinyl stereo album, \"The Fabulous Osipov Balalaika Orchestra,\" Angel\/Melodiya SR-40120 Stereo. That recording was so strikingly beautiful that I have been trying, unsuccessfully so far, to get it digitally reproduced to keep it from disappearing into the limbo of unpreserved and no longer available vinyl recordings. Recently, in another try at a computer search, I was overjoyed to discover this 2007 digital recording made for the BDAA Festival.  When I played it, I was intially pleased that someone recognized the unique beauty of this piece enough to do a more recent recording of it.  But as the performance progressed, I was horrified to find that someone had added an entirely inappropriate trap drum beat, completely ruining the ethereal, poignant, soaring richness of the piece as played by the Osipov orchestra. The composer, Vera Gorodovskaya, was a performer with the Osipov orchestra, which leads me to believe that the Osipov version would be the most authentic - I have no idea how the drum got to be added. I can only hope that, in the future, a new recording will restore the original stunning orchestration and interpretation of the 1970 recording.","9213":"love this group.","9214":"Great song","9215":"Very nice cd.","9216":"Enjoy listening to this song","9217":"Beautiful, heart felt song. A winner!","9218":"The \"Red State Sessions\" includes 8 selections from the movie.  Unfortunately only 5 are worth having, i.e., the first 5. Number 6, labeled as \"Farther Along a cappella\" is only a repeat of Number 1, and numbers 6, 7, and 8 are merely the rantings of Michael Parks from the movie, none of which is in any way enjoyable.  Save your money and let this one pass.  You might want to download \"Just a Closer Walk With Thee\", but where would you put it?","9219":"Makes one want to swim in the root-beer ocean.","9220":"I'll be honest, I found nothing original about this band but they are at the top of their game at what they do. There are plenty of melodic hard rock\/alternative metal bands out there that sound exactly like this, e.g, Red, Breaking Benjamin, Chevelle, etc. But these guys pull it off just nicely enough to put it right next to those bands separated from the generic stuff like (most of) Thousand Foot Krutch, We As Human, recent Decyfer Down or recent Skillet.\n\nOne thing that caught my attention is that there are no ballads to be found, all of the songs are melodic, some with a bit of an edge over the others but nothing that takes you out from the music, kudos for the consistency they showed on this very, very good debut. Hopefully, these guys will keep making music. 4 stars","9221":"This purchase does not seem to be for the \"Complete Radio Shows\". The download contains only one eleven-minute file.","9222":"This song has an irresistable beat that's impossible to remove from you mind after listening if your music taste are anything like mine.

I was lucky enough to catch JD at one of his live shows and delighted to find this available so quickly.","9234":"Now, THIS is that ultimate version of Sally Goodin' you've sought since you first heard the penultimate bluegrass tune performed.

I have seen the video and enjoyed it greatly; the soundtrack only--what is offered here--is noisy (the natural sounds of the onlookers and others) and was not so enjoyable to me.","9237":"As with his other 'performances,' Colombo records mechanically perfect renditions of the pieces on an electronic piano. These sound as if they were made by somehow processing the sheet music without any human intervention. I'm sure there are times when such an approach has merit, but I get little satisfaction from it.","9238":"It was supposed to be instrumental ONLY, but I had to purchase it in order to hear the whole thing.  THEREFORE did NOT know it had words.  I have spoken  to Amazon about that issue, but they \"can't do anything about it.\"","9239":"just the music, not the video... my bad, but it is not what I thought I was getting....

Musicians include Maynard Ferguson, Bud Shank and Jimmy Guiffre.\n\nThree of these tracks were wittily parodied by Allan Sherman on his 1962 WARNER BROS. comedy debut,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/MY-SON-THE-FOLK-SINGER\/dp\/B000RLLBQE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MY SON, THE FOLK SINGER<\/a>. These are \"Matilda\" (My Zelda), \"Jump Down, Spin Around\" (Pick a Dress o' Cotton) and \"Water Boy\" (Seltzer Boy).\n\nBelafonte receives lyric credits on \"Gettin' Up Mornin',\" \"Troubles,\" \"Noah,\" \"Jump Down,\" and \"Suzanne.\" The album's most famous song, the touching ballad \"Scarlet Ribbons,\" was actually recorded in 1952. After Harry toured with it for four years, that old \"Ribbons\" take was included on this Billboard-topping LP. The set-closer, \"Sylvie,\" was written by Leadbelly (Huddie Ledbetter). Although he's not credited on the LP, Leadbelly also originated \"Pick a Bale of Cotton.\" (NOTE: One person going all-out could not possibly pick a bale in a single day.)\n\nThe general mood here is one of sadness. Even the few upbeat songs have a worrisome undertone: Matilda absconded with the cash; Noah had to build that ark for a rainy reason; Gettin' Up Mornin' is a date with Judgment Day; Jump Down and sweat a pail of water.\n\n.\nSIDE ONE\n[3:42] Waterboy\n[3:38] Troubles\n[3:19] Suzanne (Every Night When the Sun Goes Down)\n[3:11] Matilda\n[6:00] Take My Mother Home\n\nSIDE TWO\n[4:53] Noah\n[3:13] Scarlet Ribbons (For Her Hair)\n[3:15] In That Great Gettin' Up Mornin'\n[3:18] Unchained Melody\n[1:54] Jump Down Spin Around (Pick a Bale of Cotton)\n[5:21] Sylvie (Bring Me Little Water, Sylvie)\n\nTOTAL TIME: 41:44","9242":"I love Norton Buffalo and would love to have this album but there is no way in hell I would spend 10 grand to buy it when Norton's website sells it for $15.","9243":"This is a great remix of the song however in this version there is no vocals from Britney. If you really want the right mix just get Britney Live In Vegas.","9244":"I like this one very much and use it often when I can't fall asleep at night.  I love the sound of a thunderstorm, just something about storms has a calming effect on me.  I would recommend if you enjoy  hearing rolling thunder.","9245":"I'm a music instructor, and I'm always looking for challenges for myself and my students.\n\nOne of my students has been learning bass. Bass parts can be very boring (in the songs she was picking out at least!)  This song is not!\n\n I challenged her to learn this bass line *and* play it this fast. I did help her by writing it out first. I challenged myself to learn the bass part also as well as the fast chord changes.  My fingers didn't like me, but I loved being able to play this with her.  Our winter recital was cancelled, so only her family heard us, but that was enough.","9246":"I hit the replay button frequenlty with this song. Definately one of Frank Ocean's many cool songs. Can't believe I didn't hear about him sooner. I've been living under a rock!","9247":"A very deep and thought provoking song, which sometimes is improperly interpreted (in my opinion) as a suicide song. The song is about choosing between standing on the shore of loneliness, desperation, and denial, or giving in and letting yourselves be swept into the depths of passionate love. And I know from experience that, if you are going to fall in love, it's far better fall completely in and be swept away...","9248":"A good traditional folk song covering the Peshtigo Fire.  Definitely worth the MP3 music cost.  If you care for folk music at all or are a history buff of the Peshtigo Fire, buy this song.","9249":"It's all about Glorifying God in everything we do.  He AAAAA Able! Jesus is the truth, the way, and the life!","9250":"Rudbard sings with smooth yet powerful soul.  Have seen him live, and he is amazing.  This captures that experience, which is saying a lot.\nHighly recommend.","9251":"I enjoy this piece tremendously, but this is, by far, the worst version that I have run in to.","9252":"This is one of my favorite dubstep songs ever! It has lots of beat and catchy tunes! A must have!","9253":"Who is this guy and does anyone know if he has anything else out?  This EP is evocative without sounding tired or redone.  Can't get the MLK song out of my head.\n\nTrying to place where I've heard the guitat sound in \"After the Night\".  Sounds familiar.","9254":"Better Than Ezra is one of my favorite bands, but I'm sorry, I hate releases like this one. The intro track is not even a song. The 2nd track a throw away less than 2 minute track not only about a subject of very little interest to me (College Football), but about a specific team in a geographic region very far from mine. The third track at less than 3 minutes is more like a commercial jingle than a song. The 4th track a country cover that nods at the previously mentioned college football team. Then, finally a decent track \"Hey Baby\" after half the record is over. \"This Time Of Year\" you already purchased on the Greatest Hits release. \"Hell No\" you already purchased on the Paper Empire release. The last track which is by far the lamest tribute to the college team of interest includes a puke inducing rap. I know the band is pandering to their hometown, but for other fans, this is an insulting release. If you're content to being a college bar band, keep putting out stuff like this.\n\nDownload Hey Baby, and leave the rest.","9255":"Love it!","9256":"My cd case was cracked when i opened the package","9257":"Wrong one","9258":"I will NOT not be returning the (2) SOUND TRACKS of \"The Secret Garden\" received for birthdays of my (2) young granddaughters in September 2013 and January 2014.  I thought I was ordering wide-screen DVD's at that time, not sound tracks.  I was not able to return them by the deadline of (today) February 14, 2014 because both girls live too far away from where I live. Recently, I had to order (2) DVD wide-screen movies of \"The Secret Garden\" for them through Walmart.","9259":"Although I am a huge fan of Guiding Light, I must say that this particular \"rendition\" of its theme left me feeling cheated! That particular theme, a beautiful composition, is raped, pillaged, burned, and buried by whomever recorded this version! It is only a shadow of its former self, and not a very good one at that. So I would say to anyone considering purchasing this monstrosity: \"QUICK, TURN OFF THE LIGHT!!\"","9260":"It's Aeroplane - c'mon - everything they touch turns to gold :D","9261":"Keep listening to it over and over, love it.","9262":"box was broken and missing 2 cds","9263":"I like the music selections a lot. Is very relaxing.","9264":"Delightful! (worth saying twice!)","9265":"Great CD, really showcases Ronny's haunting, melodic yet very metal voice! will be listening to this one for a while :)\nLong Live Metal!!!","9266":"I really like this album and I think it is comparable to Ronnie's first album.  I just wish he would have hit more hot ones like FAR but hey I'll take what I can get now that Metal Church broke up!","9267":"I ordered this for my dad, he likes it very much.","9268":"Karen Wheaton is one of the most gifted singers of today. She is a blessing singing this song as well as the many other songs I have heard her sing.","9269":"GOOFY GREATS was released in 1975 by KTEL. It's garbage. Mosst of the songs have been heavily edited. The sound quality is very poor. They attempted to put 12 songs on each side which doesn't help. The LP first sold for around $4.99.  If you want to get screwed, by all means buy this album for $74.00!","9270":"I really wouldn't call this reggae at all . More like boring jazz with hip-hop beats.","9271":"there is nothing Zombie Apocalypse about this album!! why did i buy this? because my GF sent me a link and i thought she had pre listen to it and gave it the green light.. my bad, this music sux! its more like music of an old vampire movie.. maybe i can find a use for it at the next Halloween party. track number 6. \"5 Meditations sur l'apocalypse: Cinq Meditations sur l'Apocalypse: II. Il etait, Il est et Il vient\" sounds like a mentally challenged patient got in to the Organ both at a baseball game and tried to play \"take me out to the ball game! LOL, what the hell am i listening to? save your money and buy a \"Harley Poe\" ablum!","9272":"In a moment of weakness after reading the reviews I purchased it.  Was very disappointed. I guess if you are into Halloween music it would be ok - maybe.","9273":"Iconic song. Timeless track. A Smith's must have!","9274":"Morrisey's unique perspective on naive love and the worthless self.\nSometimes being the backseat passenger to that someone who we\nperceive has the unquantifiable thing that we want, is the best we\ncan do....or say \"crawling off to sleep in the bath\".\nThe perfection we see in other's beauty is sometimes of our own\nimagination; the \"home\" we imagine others have, is not theirs either.\nOur failure to attain what we desire is sewn into the relationship,\nunrequited love...in the darkened underpass...I looked around and noticed\nthere wasn't a chair.\nStill, there is a light, and isn't it good, Norwegian Wood.","9275":"One of my favorites. Great song","9276":"I realy like the song. Brings back pleasant memories. Adequate sound and Quaility. Good Price. Enjoy the song very much","9277":"Sex Sex Sex is a law law law when the father gets a girl on the floor floor floor Love it!","9278":"I love it!!! I first heard of him in the radio and bought the cd. Too bad you can't listen to it here. You won't regret it!","9279":"I was going to give him a 4 but after listening to it so many times , is just plain BLAHHH.","9280":"thank you","9281":"We discovered Lila Downs' music when we were in Baja, can't remember how, but once we caught that voice we were drawn to it and never moved far from it. We bought her CDs and played them in the RV as we drove to the furthest reaches away from Gringolandia those beautiful three months, camping at Playa San Pedrito south of Todos Santos, and many other magical loving places. She serenaded us everywhere, & all up that east coast of Baja above La Paz, among the Mejicanos and cuervos y mar y aire tan dulce. And we don't even speak Spanish, we just sorta picked it up from her soul of song putting us in the mood to understand more deeply the ancient Mexican spirit. Her singing goes right in your chest up to the wrist and squeezes hard, and it feels like you're being drawn out into a realer life. Growing up in Santa Fe as kids we 'd sneak out & spend a lot of time at night sitting along the Santa Fe river listening to the mariachi music from the cantinas nearby, and the best of the singers were the old gals with the gutsy sad and brave voices lamenting lost beauty and passion...Lila learned from some of them, maybe not from Santa Fe, but Mexican sisters, and listening to her took me right back to the summer evenings sitting with my brothers by the river listening through the open doors of the bars... Florinda Anaya looked after us kids sometimes back then in the 40's and she'd sometime take us to the Boys Club onLower  Agua Fria and belt out songs like Lila sings... and she too could turn into a cantadora vieja and sing those songs of lost lust and love, even though she was only 18. Makes me sob a little just thinking about it. Thanks Lila!!!!!\n\nJack Underhill\n [...]","9282":"Excellent Seller!! Pristine Item, highly recommended. Thank you so very much!!!","9283":"A few months ago I purchased this CD from an Amazon third party seller. The sound was not up the previous recordings I own by Lilia Downs, and the artwork and printing was blurred.  When I looked closely, the copyright said this CD had been made in Argentina. I was in Lima, Peru last year visiting relatives and was shocked to see that virtually every CD store was filled with recordings that had grainy reproductions of cover art, illegibly blurred printing; and burned on CD-R media. Either they are bootlegs, or the manufacturing standards for CDs are far lower than in the US and Europe. I think it would be very helpful if people would comment on the quality of the packaging and the sound quality of any CDs they purchase, particularly from Amazon third party sellers. This will not only help others know what sellers provide the quality we expect, but might even help artists get the royalties they are due.","9284":"Some of the best music I've ever heard- amazing uilleann pipe, it's all great!","9285":"i don't think this is the real filter. at least i hope its not. it sounds nothing like anything else filter has done, and its absolutely dreadful. the music is screamo, not alt-rock and it is unbearable.","9286":"Low quality MP3's. Don't buy this download, buy a CD or LP of this. The MP3's sound awful and I couldn't get any help from the label on getting better ones.","9287":"They don't write them like this anymore.","9288":"This is not the band Filter from America.  This is something from China and absolutely horrible.  Obviously they're using the same name to cause brand\/band confusion and profit from it.","9289":"I love saxophone blues type music, and like some of Adele ... this combined both.  Good quality sound too, highs and lows.","9290":"This track is smooth and captures the imagination. However, its not one of those songs that can survive on a playlist that long.","9291":"Just wonderful! :)","9292":"Another great clean solid EP from Iwan! If you liked his last EP, you'd surely love this one. Though, this recording isn't just him and his guitar and has a bit more production work thrown into it (a tiny bit). Really crisp and refreshing to listen to. This will surely be on repeat!","9293":"This song is an instant classic. Smooth R&B beats, nice flow with the lyrics, and the song tackles and solves problems from modern relationships. What else can do that for less than a dollar?","9294":"This is a really good song, fast beat, nice picture too. Looking forward to hearing more from Jaymes Vaughanhen, of Chippendales! Gotta love them all :)","9295":"All the songs sound the same.","9296":"Listened to this every night before bed for 2 months, no change. Guess diet and exercise is all that works!","9297":"At 99 cents I can not complain too loudly, although with my dial up service it took hours and hours to download to my mp4.\nHowever, this item is not really subliminal, you can hear the voice of the presenter throughout.\nI have no idea of how effective this will be for me, as I have just started listening to it, but I do know that true subliminals are inaudible and with this product, you can clearly hear his voice, so it is more of a hypnosis download really than a subliminal.\n\nTime will tell .............","9298":"I loved 28 Orange Street and The Big Fear. Then Isalie came out, and it was so lifeless and dull it seemed written by a different band. I had hoped the boys' interest in pulse-free, hook-free folk tunes was a temporary glitch, but alas, it seems like the new norm. The guys who wrote the folksy bounce of Burgundy and the faux-rocker Indie Rockin' are nowhere to be seen on this collection. Instead, it's more sedate and opaque songwriting, performed with no energy or drive. There's barely anything here that would count as mid-tempo, to say nothing of upbeat.\n\nLike Isalie, I listened to this three or four times, and I couldn't tell you anything about any of the songs, and that makes me sad. Hopefully the upcoming collaboration with Dan Bern will be a return to form; until then, you're better off spinning the Big Fear again and dreaming.","9299":"didn[t sound right","9300":"I bought this download. This was incorrectly labeled as the song from GHOST. The correct\nversion in the movie is sung by the Righteous Brothers. Amazon-Please Correct Label!","9301":"Great hymns to sing along with or just to listen to and enjoy. Brandon is obviously a great pianist but he doesn't make his skill the point of the album. Truly a blessing to listen to.","9302":"Wrong song","9303":"While this may be a great recording...I really couldn't say, as I could never get it to download and even called the Geek squad, who came to the house and we repurchased the thing and then tried to download it again....never happened...so a waste of money twice in a row.","9304":"Fleming does a good job but Keillor takes some liberities with the baritone harmony and strays from Foster's verison in notes and range.","9305":"when i read \"without bass\", i figured, well, NO BASS! my bad i guess, for believing it...and its distorted. how do i get my .89 back?","9306":"I agree with the other reviewer of this product. Many classical albums labeled as 'relaxing' or 'quiet' make you wonder how on earth they ever got titled such given the often loud, clangy music. Not so with this album; the piano is well done, calm, and relaxing; highly recommended.","9307":"Sometimes, every once in a while one hears song so beautiful, it moves the soul to tears!","9308":"Major disapointment here. My prior and first experience with Incriminated was listening to \"Miracle Of Purity\". That was a hit. Really good Hellhammer-influenced blackened thrash with some slow-to-mid tempo variations.\n\"Possessed In Billnas\" caught my eye since it is hand numbered and limited to 333 copies (is it really ? That is pretty kult). I also enjoy live CDs as they capture the true, stripped sound of a band. Plus you're usually getting somewhat of a \"best of\". Here, we have  a set that sounds like it was recorded on someone's phone. Most of the music either sounds like:\nA) some cruddy, casual YouTube audio\n2) someone playing Guitar Hero\nHas anyone ever listened to \"Agony In Paradise\" - Possessed's live CD ? That was a DAT soundboard recording which sounds way better than this.\nThe liner notes from this 2005 recording on the insert state \"Drunkenness, lewdness, blasphemy, and profanity. This album is an uncensored document of all the hell. It's not technically perfect but the energy is there.\"\nI can completely respect every word of that. And this is coming from someone who enjoys raw, abrasive, unpolished production. But here, it's just too low-fi and unlistenable. Eventually I will move on to another studio release from Incriminated. In the meantime, I will keep listening to \"Miracle Of Purity\".\nMonokrom - 2009\n\n- Jay in Texas","9309":"Twenty or so unique songs for 7 bucks.  I liked about 15 of them so it was a good deal for me.","9310":"I don't understand why the format had to change.  I've purchased music from Amazon before and had no problems.  Since they started with the 'cloud' application, I have problems downloading music to my computer in MP3 format, or at all for that matter.  After several attempts, I had to contact Amazon and get a refund for music purchased but never received.  Unfortunate though, because it was really convenient - at first.","9311":"I wanted the same version of the music video on Youtube ([...]), but this is not, despite the description \"as made famous by Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue\". Also this version shows an disproportionate and ridiculous use of Autotune.","9312":"Great energy, great tune. Hope The Heathens post more songs for sale too. Would love a live version as well of this one.","9313":"By far this is my favorite song. I listen to it for hours on repeat. It is very soothing.","9314":"Just what I wanted. Wonderful music with all the high, mid and lower ranges. Flows as it should. Highly recommend.","9315":"Submerged is soothing and very relaxing. The soft rise and fall of the strings at the end of the song made me feel like I was completely immersed in a large \"peace bubble.\" I highly recommend Submerged for anyone who needs to unwind and relax. It's simply beautiful.","9316":"This selection of \"May Each Day\" is the closing  of his show and is only two lines of the song.  Were it the whole  song it would be  a 5-star.","9317":"It is not nearly as well performed or as good as I remembered.  I guess Whitesnake is still Whitesnake.","9318":"Not Europe's The Final Countdown!  It's some has-been band's horrendous attempt at a remake.","9319":"I love everything I've heard from this band.  Their  obvious passion for the music comes through in every song.  Excellent!","9320":"Bait & Switch - this is not 'I hate myself for loving you' by Joan Jett & the Blackhearts.  It's a horrendous 'remake'.\n\nThis is the third time I've purchased a well-known song from Amazon music only to discover it isn't the actual song but an awfully done 'remake'\/mix.\n\nAmazon music had been my go-to for buying music, but they have had fewer & fewer popular songs\/hits, & now they're substituting terrible remakes made by older, has-been artists\/bands while advertising the songs as being by the original artists?  Not cool.","9321":"-This is a nice children's song but its NOT from Finding Nemo this is a children's worship song NOT a Disney song","9322":"Seriously, their music is good, but I don't know what the hell is up with that price tag.  You can get for less than half of that at their website.","9323":"Allah is my favorite musical performance. From the manic piano to the deep guitar, it is jaw dropping. We grew up calling it Greek, but now think its at least half Roma by way of Beirut, a pillar in my musical experience and cannot recommend it highly enough. Buy it, you will not be sorry.","9324":"I thought Country Feedback was a good song to begin with, but this version sends it flying into the atmosphere. The introduction lasts over 2 minutes while Neil Young rocks out on acoustic guitar. The final coda of Stipe singing \"It's crazy what you could have had\/I need this!\" has him hitting his highest note that I can ever remember, and holding that final \"need\" for almost 14 seconds. Just amazing, and the song still had 2 and a half minutes left. At $1, you should have already bought this song.","9325":"Ayaka has a great voice. She and her music really stands out from other Japanese pop stars out there. Anybody who is a fan of Japanese pop should give this one a listen.","9326":"this is a very tired version. liked everything else from the bridgeschool, but not this one. I deleted it after listening to less than half of it.","9327":"Very interesting soundtrack for BF3. Doesn't follow the conventional \"epic\" orchestral soundtracks of most games\/movies. It sounds dark and industrial. A nice change from the normal stuff. I like the distorted sound of the instruments...adds a grittiness to it all. One of my fav soundtracks of all times? No but I'll give it a listen to now and again.","9328":"Unfortunately it did not meet my expectations because the WRONG record was in the album sleeve. It was the Gaylords singing Italian songs in Italian, not American songs in Italian. I still am keeping my eyes our for the correct album. It is hilarious!","9329":"Brings back memories of my early youth - wonderful.","9330":"I Love this song, but paid for it so I could use it as a ringtones & it will not load onto my phone like all of my other Amazon songs! So disappointed","9331":"Scott Weiland seems to enjoy performing these christmas songs and this is probably the stand out on the album.  I think he gives a great delivery and the band treats the song just right.  Classy and fun.  Weiland is better than most at this game.  I can't stand most Christmas singers these days, but I like his style.","9332":"no one an sing this song better than Michael Buble. Cant sit still or keep from snapping my fingers while this is playing.","9333":"Love it","9334":"Great rendition with an outstanding band!!!","9335":"My favorite Christmas CD.

Do yourself a favor and grab their albums now. (...)\n\nYou won't regret it.","9341":"I only wish it was longer!\nIf you are interested in Porcupine Tree, Floyd , Airbag, etc, you will enjoy this album.  Hope to see more from this band in the future.","9342":"does not even SOUND like ode to joy at all  ignore at ALL COST, it sounds like a BAD chip tune (yuck)","9343":"AWESOME!  You guys still got it.  Keep doing it.  A fan since 1975.  I just missed Jackie Blue.","9344":"Vic Damon's is one of my all time favorite male singers. He does not disappoint as always. Downloaded other songs from this album.","9345":"Shadowraptr is an indie band from Cincinnati. I had never heard of these guys until recently (more on that later), and I wondered if they were a rap band (given their band name). I couldn't have been more wrong. The band's sound is an intriguing mix of prog rock and funk if you can believe that.\n\n\"It's Always Winter On the Moon\" (9 tracks; 43 min.) starts off with the 1 min. instrumental of \"Psychosis in Am Pt. III\", only then to delve into the 6 min. \"Cadavers\", which lays the groundwork for this album, an outstanding, expanding track, led by lead singer\/drummer Aaron Collins. The guitar work from Stephen Patota is nice too. Other good tracks include \"Hey Kids! Let's Rap(tr)\", a great funky tune (and again, no rapping). The album concludes with the ambitious 7+ min. \"Psychosis in Am Pt. I and II\".\n\nIn all, this is a promising debut album. I saw these guys recently in concert here in Cincinnati, where they played many of the songs of this album, and live it sounded much heavier and funkier than what you hear on here. Can't wait to see them again.","9346":"I did not enjoy this album at all.  This is just not my kind of music, it turned out.  may be you like it.","9347":"THOMAS EDISUN'S ELECTRIC LIGHT BULB BAND-Red Day in 1967 then on to ZUIDER ZEE in 1975. This guy had the potental to be a number one multiple hit musician. Like the Beatles never split up. Great singer. He put this album out eight years later and the songs are great too. He should have kept recording every year and I'll tell you, I would have to hear every song and I'll bet I would Love every single one he makes. Great talent.","9348":"Great track from the Talking Heads that's a joy to listen to. I'd forgotten about this song, so glad I rediscovered it.","9349":"Good","9350":"I love the bass line on this song, simple yet catchy. The singing and drumming and guitar playing is also excellent.","9351":"I love this new cd, the lyrics and music are great, i can't stop listening to this cd. The music and artist remind me of johnny cash, awesome voice, cant wait for more cd's to come out!!","9352":"Sad, it was very dirty and scratched. I do feel the parts that worked was worth the money I spent.","9353":"It's really bad","9354":"I'd like to play this at a summer party at somebody's place by the beach. I like Samphie Man, Ooh Child, and It Took a Miracle","9355":"I love this song.  It is fast paced and peppy with a great positive  message!  Nikitta's vocals are absolutely amazing!","9356":"I have always enjoyed this interpretation and have owned it in many guises,from its domestic and then German LP pressings and most recently as an EMI Great Recordings of the Century CD re-mastered in 2001.  In each case there remained a kind of \"wooliness\" to the sound picture which prevented me from appreciating the beauty of the solo voices  and chorus - which seemed hard and too deeply buried in the fabric of the sound picture - with the result that the New Philharmonia Chorus and Orchestra never seemed fully focused ..at least through my stereo and home entertainment systems.\n\nThus it was with some uneasiness  that I plunked down almost $50 for this Japanese SACD pressing, which has been around for awhile. I would have done so sooner but I kept hoping EMI would release it as one of its very inexpensive DSD SACD sets of Klemperer material (Mozart symphonies, etc.) which became available domestically in 2012.  In any event  now that I've previewed this SACD pressing my impression is that it may be slightly but not dramatically better than the 2001 CD.  The general sound picture is very similar to that of the earlier CD.  There may or may not be a greater sense of solidity to the image.  My guess is that recent re-mastering processes were not used to upgrade the master tape transfer from its 2001 incarnation so that it was still this 2001 tape that was transferred via SACD to the CD disc.  Solo voices remained slightly \"hard\" and were still somewhat lost in the orchestral sound picture.\nGiven this, the question then becomes one of  whether this slight possible improvement is worth the extra $$$$.  At best I'd call it a close call.\n\nADDENDUM:  I've just determined that this Japanese pressing is probably not a SACD at all, which would explain its very small sonic differences with my earlier \"Great Recordings of the Century\" CD that I'd used for comparisons.  MY CD\/SACD\/DVD\/BluRay player has a screen feature in which each disc being played is identified by type (either \"CDDA\" for conventional CDs or \"SACD PCM\". When I checked this Japanese pressing it read  \"CDDA Stereo 44.1K 16B\" which is the same reading I get for my conventional American \"Great Recordings of  the Century\" CD.  Furthermore, nowhere is the Japanese disc identified as \"SACD\" = with SONY's SACD and DSD trademarks in English....Only that it is in \"stereo\".  I've contacted the distributor to call this to their attention and identified two possibilities 1) that they'd mistakenly sent me the wrong pressing, or 2) that they've mis-advertised the type of CD on Amazon...which would lead to more serious consequences.  I've not yet heard from them, and if I don't within the next few days I will contact Amazon to press this complaint for their action.","9357":"The Smooth Jazz All Stars give a wonderful rendition to every song they play, if you like jazz, you will love hearing some of your favorite songs played by this group of musicians.","9358":"Music to fall in love with.","9359":"Singer\/saxophonist and band leader Robert Parker, born in New Orleans, Louisiana on October 14, 1930, is probably better known for his prolific session work than his own recordings having worked with giants like Fats Domino, Huey \"Piano\" Smith, Irma Thomas and, of course, Professor Longhair (real name Roy Byrd), including his 1949 regional hit Mardi Gras In New Orleans. In 1960 he cut his first solo single, the instrumental All Nite Long Parts 1 and II for Joe Ruffino's Ron Records (Ron 327), which also did very well on a regional basis.\n\nBut his own hits were sparse, with the best being his vocal Barefootin' which surged to # 2 R&B and # 7 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in May\/June 1966 for Nola Records, owned by Wardell Quezergue (March 12, 1930 - September 6, 2011) who, known as \"the Creole Beethoven\" in his native Louisiana, also produced his sides for that label. Released as Nola 721, the flip was Let's Go Baby (Where The Action Is), a tune in keeping with the ongoing Go-Go Dancing craze of the day. After the follow-up Happy Feet\/The Scratch went nowhere that same year on Nola 726, he managed to edge onto both charts again in January 1967 with the # 48 R&B\/# 83 Hot 100 Tip Toe on Nola 729 b\/w Soul Kind Of Loving. In the meantime, he had had his one vinyl LP released titled, naturally, \"Barefootin'\" (Nola LP-1001) containing:  A1. Barefootin'; A2. Let's Go, Baby (Where The Action Is); A3. Mr. Pitful; A4. I've Been Loving You Too Long; A5. Soul Kind Of Living; A6. C. C. Rider; B1. The Scratch; B2. Happy Feet; B3. In The Midnight Hour; B4. Directly From My Heart; B5. Heading For A Fall; B6. I Can't Help Myself.\n\nAfter that it would be tough sledding as none among the following could get him back on the charts: Secret Service (Makes Me Nervous)\/Yak Yak Yak (Nola 733) and Holdin' Out\/Caught You In A Lie (Nola 738), both in 1967, followed by You Shaken' Things Up\/You See Me (Silver Fox 12) in 1969, Get Ta Steppin'\/Get Right On Down (Island 015) in 1974 and Give Me The Country Side Of Life\/same song (Island 044) in 1975. In that span, of course, he continued with his busy session work. There may well have been other singles of which I am unaware. You should note that Barefootin' had also come out in 1966 on Head 1050 b\/w Shootin' The Grease by Jesse Gresham Plus 3, but the Nola release is recognized as the hit version.\n\nThe tracks in this volume are: 1. Barefootin' (2:33); 2. Let's Go Baby (Where The Action Is) (2:28); 3. Mr. Pitiful (2:35); 4. I've Been Loving You Too Long (To Stop Now) (2:53); 5. Soul Kind Of Loving (2:49); 6. C.C. Rider (2:59); 7. The Scratch (2:35); 8. Happy Feet (2:13); 9. In The Midnight Hour (2:30); 10. Directly From My Heart (3:46); 11. Heading For A Fall (2:28); 12. I Can't Help Myself (2:27); 13. Tip Toe (2:28); 14. Secret Service (2:45); 15. Yak Yak Yak (2:42); 16. Everybody's Hip Huggin' (2:46); 17. Foxy Mama (2:46); 18. Holdin' Out (2:32); 19. I Caught You In A Lie (2:40); 20. Barefootin' Boogaloo (2:40); 21. Soul Sister (2:51); 22. Bow Legs (2:40); 23. Boss Lovin' (2:43); 24. Funky Soul Train (2:44).\n\nFrom that you can see that all four sides to his only two nationally-charted singles are here, with excellent sound reproduction.","9360":"I love this album. Mr Parker lives just down the road from me and I was thrilled to find this album. I had him autograph it.","9361":"Robert Parker's classic recordings for the Nola label deserve much better than this.  Everything here is mastered from vinyl, and in many cases, it's very bad vinyl.  Hiss, major scratches and distortion abound in most of these transfers.  This is a truly dreadful CD.","9362":"These are my Parents","9363":"What happens when you take bad modern emo bands and add 8 bit soundtracks over the song? This crap. Being a avid fan for nerdcore I can enjoy bad music, it comes with the genre, but this terrible. I won't even bother giving this another listen.","9364":"This was one of 3 songs downloaded for preschool kids to sing for a Christmas program.  They really enjoyed it.","9365":"I didn't buy this, don't know where it came from, A little upset that it wasn't something good since I somehow bought and paid for it!

Im OVER amazon music.  deleted the app as well as all other invasive amazon apps. suggest everyone else do the same!","9370":"I'm rating the MP3 quality, not the tune itself. As if you're here, you probably already know Satie's Gymnopdie No. 1 is awesome.\n\nI've purchased hundreds of classical works off Amazon and the sound quality of this one in comparison is just horrible. Even if I turn the treble all the way up on my stereo, it still sounds very muffled and not crisp at all. Gonna hunt for another version that sounds better.","9371":"R.I.P. Productions (and their alias of Double 99) is the British duo of Tim Liken & Omar Adimora.  R.I.P. were hands down some of the biggest pioneers in the 90's UK Garage scene and by far one of my favorite acts.  With nearly every single they released becoming an underground hit, R.I.P. produced a unique and identifiable feel to every track.  Here are my thoughts and track ratings on R.I.P. Grooves Vol. 1;\n\n1. Move to Jersey  10\/10 (Vocal sample with bumpy piano riffs)\n2. The Rub (Remix)  9\/10 (DnD's \"Diamond Rings\" riff mixed with some female doo-wop vocals)\n3. Reach  10\/10 (Bumpy Vocal dub UK Garage that's simply amazing!)\n\nOriginally released on Ice Cream Records vinyl in 1996, R.I.P. Grooves Vol. 1 is another one of R.I.P. Productions most perfect releases.  With all three tracks representing the best of the 90's underground UK Garage scene.  With the rerelease of these tracks in digital format from the original vinyl (which are now quite expensive) has made me as a long time UK Garage fan very happy.","9372":"very ponderous version.  expected an orchestral version, probably should have sampled it first.","9373":"Exceptionally beautiful and restful music.  Just awesome!","9374":"I purchased this work BECAUSE of the timing, of the many versions I have this is exceptional. It is in keeping with, as some consider, Satie's muse, and the timing is VERY intentional to the piece. Please try this it takes practice to get deep enough.\nMany are hard put to give it, its due. A much deeper Satie experience.","9375":"The pianist on \"Gymnopdies\" does not have the understanding of Satie's timing; it's a horrible rendering of the Gymnopdies, in my opinion. I purchased the album \"Erik Satie\" played by Reinbert de Leeuw who certainly does understand the importance of Satie's timing. Brilliant!","9376":"It wasn't even the best of the Capitol Records compilations (Merry Christmas Baby - Romance and Reindeer...I believe the second disc in that series...takes that spot)...  There were only three or four tracks on this that I actually liked...and three were on other compilations...  The Les Paul jingle Bells might have been worth the price of the CD alone...but the rest drug it down...  Other honorable mentions would be Tex Ritter's Merry Christmas Polka...and Ray Anthony & The Bookends Christmas Kisses...\n\nThree I found on Dr. Demento compilations (and with better quality) Stan Freberg's Night Before Christmas...Yogi Yorgesson's I Yust Go Nuts At Christmas and the immortal Mel Blanc Yah das ist ein Christmas Tree...\n\nIf you must have all four discs...this would be the hardest to find...and judging by most of that is on it...I can tell why...  The absolute low point was Bing Crosby croaking out the tired old dud called Do You Hear What I Hear?...  This one alone made me break out the Tiny Tim Christmas Album AND Hung For the Holidays to get that asinine banter out of my head...  Anything that causes you to do this is really not worth buying...","9377":"magic in string form","9378":"Haitians love this song! And with good reason: the second you hear it you're on your feet moving to the beat. And the chorus is super catchy too!","9379":"Outstanding song - says what so many of us are thinking.  So damn tired of all the junk from Fox & Friends and the goverenment.","9380":"I prefer the Hank Williams who sang \"Hey, Good Lookin',\" \"Your Cheatin' Heart\" and \"Move It On Over.\" That Hank Williams had dignity, class and talent.","9381":"all I can say is I second Phyliss's review. its time we all stand up for our liberty. apparently the only ones who have freedom of speech are the ones on the left. dare someone with a conservative point of view criticize the socialist policies of the obama regime and we are branded racists. perhaps one should listen to the hate speech going on at the occupy wherever crowds, and compare that to the respectful, lawful and clean rallies held by the tea party. apparently they are asking the wall street occupying miscreants to leave tonight so they can clean upand disinfect after their filth. the tea party rallies left the washington mall cleaner then when they arrived. and the miscreants on wall street are suppose to care about their environment. what hypocrisy. i think that says it all. by the way it's a great song to, and i have Hank's back as well, as well as all the other freedom lovers in the USA!

USA!","9382":"I wish this was longer because its really spooky ! perfect for halloween night to scare all the kiddies !","9383":"just what we needed for the show we we're doing for charity...Ever one loved it...It will be a good resource since all my backgrounds are cassettes...lol","9384":"This song is good, nice beat, excellent lyrics. In fact, I'd buy the entire album rather than just this one song.","9385":"Great stuff from Pentatonix...","9386":"It did not download any place I can find it.","9387":"I am really enjoying this album and will be in the market for more from Chris Mann. He has a refreshing sound that I really love.","9388":"Thank you","9389":"Great upbeat song.

Great example of Christian pop music today.","9393":"This CD is not The Lion by Wild Adriatic.  Whoever is selling this has made an error.\n\nWild Adriatic can be found on I tunes and Facebook.","9394":"This album\/soundtrack perfectly complimented the movie \"Life In A Day\", which was also a sensational movie unto itself.  Have all your friends see the movie and hear the soundtrack.  It will change your life, if you want a better world...","9395":"AGAIN I LOVE TYRESE...VERY MELODIC,FULL OF ACTION & ADVENTURE & A GREAT SINGER.\nNOT MANY SINGERS CAN SING & Act,,HE'S ONE OF THE FEW","9396":"This album is amazing. I listen to it every day. I highly recommend it if you like good music. Ricky Rebel Rocks!!!","9397":"sultry, sexy sound","9398":"seemed to make matter worse","9399":"This is one of the all time great songs, and one of Tull's best; but there's a buzzing in this 40th anniversary remix.  Why has no one mentioned this?  I have the full 40th anniversary Aqualung CD and Locomotive Breath has a buzzing in it, so I decided to buy Locomotive Breath by itself and it has the same buzzing, starting about 2\/3 of the way through.  It's obviously defective.","9400":"Haven't even listened to the CD yet, but the jewel case was cracked (large cracks) in 5 different places and the CD had 2 scratches on it. Yes, this IS a review of the PRODUCT because the box was unscathed. This damage occurred before the item was placed in the box. I'm NOT HAPPY at all.","9401":"one of those songs whose entire lyrics seem to be chanting a very sharp message. this one is very obvious. but the glaring one\nhits home like few can. \"jesus saves...\". you go argue with that.\nfurthermore, Anderson did very few hard rock numbers vocally, justice the way he does here.","9402":"Track was damaged .. Played at such HighSpeed, Sounds like Techno Music .. I was unable to use track for desired purpose .. Flipagram\nIt Gets NO STARS .. I pressed One only because I couldn't submit review otherwise","9403":"I need more! .... lol but seriously... Valoras music is totally worth the listen. I totally plan on being a continuous fan...","9404":"I like it when I heard it on Sirius xm.\n\nFiller words word word word word word word word word word","9405":"I have listened to this CD for a couple weeks now and I think that I love ALL the songs on it. It encompasses multiple genres of praise and worship ranging from rock with guitar solos to country and upbeat music that will set your feet dancing. The lyrics will melt your heart as the presence of God fills the room.  This is a \"must buy\" for any worshipper who wishes to honour God and draw close to Him.","9406":"I love listening to this song on the radio and find it to be a great wake up song too!","9407":"Good song. Rick Ross' feature is a good add to the song. Tyrese's voice is always good to listen to.","9408":"This guy's album is called \"Beatles From My Heart.\"  Take a look at the picture on the cover and you can see the guy is 100% sincere.  And he can play, wow!!!!!!!  An exciting find!!!","9409":"as usual, it disappeared from my library","9410":"Really like Tobys song. Everyone should listen to his music and just have a smile on thier face all day.","9411":"I didn't order this, no clue how it showed up on my \"write a review\". So it gets one star.","9412":"I did not order this.","9413":"Toby Keith's great re-make of a classic by Three Gog Night. Highly recommend this one. Give it a shot. You'll enjoy it.","9414":"This song describes my life and how i hope it turns out well later on. We all could learn something if we learned how to relate to others in spite of circumstances. I believe we all should learn how to love others unconditionally. If we choose to love them in spite of what they have done against us we become a better person for it.","9415":"Shared this song with somebody that needed something up in their live, it had a very positive effect.  While listening to it myself I could not help worshiping the God that sought me, and bought me by his grace through the gift of his son Jesus.","9416":"I downloaded this song quite a while ago and have had an opportunity to share it with quiet a few seniors who needed the encouragement.","9417":"simply uplifting and beautiful","9418":"Does not hold a candle to Randy Newman's version. I felt it lacked simplicity and was over complicated. I would not suggest it, even at the price of \"free\" like when I downloaded it.","9419":"This song is bittersweet.  It's a sad song with wonderful lyrics and medley.  If you only think of Toby Keith as a redneck, give this one a try.  You might just see another side of him.","9420":"(My rating if for the cd overall, not the music on it) I bought this cd thinking that it was gonna be exactly the same as the real one. It's NOT, it's not even close. The cover isn't the same, and the picture is in bad quality. The name of the cd\/artist isn't even correct! Hera's last name has an accent mark above the 'o' and \"Je Ne Sais Quoi\" is spelled wrong. So if you want the ACTUAL cd, I don't recommend you buy this one. You'd be better of purchasing the mp3s and burning your own cd.\nOn the positive side, the music is really good!","9421":"Love playing this at our Pub Nights at the resort we stay at. Good sing-a-long.","9422":"The Illusion - If It's So (original vinyl LP)\n\n  All 3 of the Illusion albums are stunning albums......heavy in some parts....fuzzed out psychy in other parts yet still full of soul and rock 'n roll.  \"If it's So\" was the debut album and by the end of 1969 they would have released their second album.\n\n  The Illusion were  Michael Ricciardella (drums), Richie Cerniglia (guitar), Chuck Alder (bass), Mike Maniscalco(guitar, keyboards), and John Vinci (vocals). The Steed label released three albums over two years and then they sadly broke up and now psychedelic rock collectors are scooping up their albums.\n\n  Musically this band were phenoms......hard psych driving power ripping chords.....acid drenched rock bits with powerful vocals and excellent instrumentation.  For those who like their psych a bit crunchy will drool over this nugget!","9423":"I have to agree with Achoo, This is great music from a great band and this CD does not do any of it justice. I feel the quality of the CD was not to good and the songs Man and Collections were started a couple of notes into the song which was indeed disappointing to me.  It is my hope a U.S. company will make all three Illusion albums on CD because this band is worth listening to","9424":"KT Tunstall is on this so how could it not be a great CD to add to a music collection ??  :>\n\nI love it so much. Thank you !\n\nI received my order very quickly and so appreciate that.\n\nLooking forward to doing future business with you :>","9425":"love","9426":"A funky, slightly off-key but delightful rendition of an old standard, love it!\nNow one of my top 10 favorites","9427":"This is a great CD, it brings back many memories from my childhood!!!!! Yes I remember when there was lots of great music and really great musicians.","9428":"Tommy Doyle Is Awesome..\nSounds Incredible","9429":"Put this on and you'll think you're listening to a mid-70's Kinks Album. Lead singer sounds amazingly like Ray Davies!  A rare and amazing Record.","9430":"Some \"motor city roller\" group performing stevie songs. No wonder it was cheap.....","9431":"CD didn't play after 2 minutes :(","9432":"Apparently \"lullaby\" means xylophone and sleigh bells to Twinkle Twinkle Little Rock Star. I love Iron Maiden and was hoping to be able to pass on my love of their music in a way that's gentle to young ears. I wanted to like this album, but couldn't.\n\nThe concept is fantastic, but the execution is very poor with the stereotypical and unimaginative arrangement of xylophone\/marimba percussion and childish music box sounds. Many of the songs are unrecognizable. Most annoying are the sleighbells. They feature prominently in EVERY single one of the songs. Really? Is this Christmas versions of Iron Maiden or did I read the title wrong? How about some soft guitar or violins, or anything else for that matter?\n\nIt's a real insult to the musical genius of the band, one of the most creative and influential bands of our time. They could've done so much with the source material, but instead chose to make a bland, uninspired, and gutless low-fidelity experience. The lack of care to the source material extends down to the cover, which looks like a bad Halloween party poster. They couldn't done a clever child-friendly take on one of Iron Maiden's album art. You can listen for yourself to the samples provided by Amazon and make your own decision. If you have Amazon Prime, you can listen to the full album on your mobile app for free.\n\nUp the Irons. Down with this CD.","9433":"We've got a whole bunch of the Rockabye Baby! and they're pretty good.  Is it that the galloping bass of Steve Harris doesn't translate...?  IDK, but I was unimpressed by these...","9434":"Very different take on the oldies \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\".  Heard it once and wanted a copy of it for my collection.","9435":"Wasn't impressed. She & Him this duos holiday album is nothing earth shattering same with the non holiday music they put out. The She of She & Him's voice isn't very the most tolerable barely hitting notes. Him of the duo does a decent job of playing the holiday classics. This album would be pretty decent as a instrumental.","9436":"Would give this zero stars if I could.  Love this song, but their version makes me want to puncture my ear drums to make it stop.","9437":"Great purchase! You can never go wrong with music. Zoey's voice has a soothing quality to it and I am buying more of her songs and album!","9438":"This is five stars I love it and in no way am I a friend of Matt Ward's like the other reviewers. I'm his worst enemy.","9439":"I would recommend \"Strings and Keys\" to anyone cruising a sunny day looking for great tunes to go with the wind in their hair.  \"Leave This All Behind\" is just the song for putting that \"to-do\" list in the rearview. Evocative lyrics remind us that what matters most ain't the dust bunnies. Kate","9440":"I discovered the Kidney Thieves and Free Dominguez from their work on the sound track for the video game Deus Ex Invisible War. KT was featured in a very limited part of the game, however, just that tidbit was enough to change my perspective on music for ever. Up until that point in my life I'd only listened to classic rock, classic country and a hair bit of anything else. KT opened my eyes to a whole new world of music that I hadn't even known exisited...to date I haven't heard a single track that I can honestly say, \"eh its okay\". Every single song is its own. Thank you KT for making music that kicks A$$ on every level from the words, the depth, melody, everything. I highly recommned that you give these tracks and all other KT work(to include Free Dominguez's solo work) a good thorough listen.","9441":"I've been a fan of kidneythieves for years and have closely followed all of their releases. Many bands as they continue to churn out albums start to lose the creative touch, their edge diminished. Not so with these guys. This follow up EP to last year's Tryptofanatic is equally brilliant. It's far more melodic and ambient than the heavy guitars and industrial metal riffs that they are known for, but that doesn't mean it doesn't rock. And as always, the highlights are the vocal styling of lead singer Free Dominguez and the philosophical core to the lyrics. It's a journey that will make you bob your head as well as provoke deep thought. Music is in a sad state currently with over-produced, over-hyped cookie cutter bands striving for radio-friendliness. kidneythieves notoriously buck that trend and make the music they want to make. That reason alone is enough to elicit your support.","9442":"Helped me learn the Bass line","9443":"DO NOT BUY...About 30-40 minutes into the program, it cuts to a later sequence for a few seconds and then returns to where it left off.","9444":"worth the listen!","9445":"Always a classic!","9446":"This version is terrible.

It doesn't try to overwhelm, but reaches for a fine emotional balance to carry listeners on a personal journey through rich landscapes of pure emotion.\nThis is truly gorgeous solo piano record of extraordinary recording quality.\nYou can hear chords echo off of canyon walls and hear the quite of a summer's field. The grandeur of the wide open big sky plains above are ended only by the curvature of the earth below, with lyrical, trickling sounds of coursing streams conjured across such beautiful sounds of grandeur and serenity.\n\nIt all shows in LaRoche's careful crafting and ability to vary his style and choice of tonalities. The dynamics are very subtle, even missed a few times until you notice them. Soothing, melodic and dextrous playing that set's this album apart as something very special indeed.","9448":"I wanted the speak to my heart which is on the essential album this was the wrong song and they don't let you see enough of the name or hear enough of the sample to determine. I was using my phone to try to order it.","9449":"This album like all the rest of them from the Emerson group is a masterstroke.\n\nHaving seen the quartet play in concert and having listened to all of their recordings, it's  sad for me to see David Finkel leaving the group. The album cover shows him halfway out the door.  I've seen David Finkel play in other ensembles at local chamber festivals and he always takes the lead in focussing the energies of the other players. What the Emerson \"trio\" will do with him gone time will tell us. I feel for the cellist who wants to enter that special micro world of the Emerson Quartet. But who knows. No one is irreplaceable  David and his wife Wu Han as heads of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center will continue their world wide search for talent. They are remarkable international advocates for their art.","9450":"This version is tamed at the point of being insignificant. If you can find it, get the version by the Taricata, named \"Ninella\". We plaeyd it hundreds of times....)(","9451":"Vocals, riffs, beats.  All outstanding.  I don't like equating them with Sabbath as the vocals are nothing like them.  Iommi was awesome too in his day, but this is better.  What Iommi would have wanted.  Listened to it yesterday with earbuds in while doing physical work...  I worked my ass-off and didn't even notice what I'd accomplished until it was over.  Had to listen to it again in the car on the ride home.  Outstanding.","9452":"I've not been excited about new music for quite some time, but this band shifts that paradigm. Fantastic composition mated with meaningful lyrics (not to mention the masterful execution of it all) makes the band's second full-length album a solid, hard-hitting testament to the true musician's art. I'd be tempted to say that Long Distance Trip is the better of the two main albums currently on the market, but that statement is really unfair. Remember that music must be dynamic, as must the band that creates it. Definitely worth the buy and your patronage! If you're unsure of this, just check out their page on Bandcamp:\n\n[...]","9453":"Shai Linne is an awesome Gospel Lyrical Artist. He truly has an amazing way of bringing out the Gospel through songs! Love the Journey he is able to take you on through his lyrics. Music is always good too!!

It sounds like it was made out of three or four different songs That don't even blend within the same genre.  Disappointed.","9457":"GREAT","9458":"The year was 1979 and movie themes were making a comeback due to the success of box office smashes like \"Star War,\" \"Saturday Night Fever,\" and \"Superman.\"  What better form to showcase Barry White's Love Unlimited Orchestra than to have the ensemble try its hand at these and other well-known melodies.  However, White pays homage to classic themes as well, including \"Theme from A Summer Place,\" \"The Way We Were,\" and the best track on the album, \"As Time Goes By\" from \"Casablanca.\"\n\nWhite even does his own take on contemporary Isaac Hayes' Oscar-winning \"Theme from Shaft.\"\n\nTracks\n\n1  Theme from Superman\n2) Theme from King Kong\n3) Night Fever\n4) Grease\n5) Intermission\n6) Theme from Shaft\n7) Theme from a Summer Place\n8) The Way We Were\n9) As Time Goes By\n10) People of Tomorrow Are the Children of Today","9459":"This is not a deep review. The fact is i saw a movie the other day and this song was playing in what I think was the most fun scene of the film. It just kind of stuck in my head so I bought it. I'm surprised I never came across it all these years. Upbeat and fun song. Didn't pay close attention to the lyrics one way or another like I usually do. It was definitely an exception to my rule.","9460":"There are far too many duplicate tracks, especially if also bought the 99 Most Essential Autumn, Winter, & Spring series.","9461":"X5 has done it again. They have issued a mix of old, re-hashed material from other collections in their \"99\" series and new classical music that is pretty interesting -- at least interesting enough to draw me in at the bargain price as the MP3 Daily Deal on October 14, 2011.\n\nThis is almost all excellent music in good to very good performances. If you haven't bought a lot of these collections previously, it is a no-brainer at the special price.\n\nSome number crunching. Based on my own collection -- these numbers may be much smaller or a little larger for you depending on what you've purchased from these sets in the past -- 52 of the 99 tracks here have been released on previous \"99\" sets by X5. A further four tracks are music that has been featured before, but are here in different performances. The remaining 43 tracks are music new to the series.\n\nAmong the music that has been featured before are a lot of classical music \"greatest hits\" -- some of the most famous Beethoven piano sonatas, Schubert's Rosamunde string quartet, Brahms' 3rd Symphony, and a good smattering of Mozart, for example.\n\nWithin the set of new music, a few things stood out and tipped me over the edge on the decision to buy. Most important was the inclusion of Charles Ives' Violin Sonata No. 2, played by Sweden's Karl-Ove Mannberg and Lena Johnson. X5 is pretty savvy when it comes to capitalizing on what's going on in the classical world, so I imagine they included this because violin superstar Hilary Hahn has just released&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/her-own-excellent-album-of-the-Ives-sonatas\/dp\/B005DWX9YO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">her own excellent album of the Ives sonatas<\/a>. I was glad to hear the Mannberg\/Johnson performance, but I can't say it's my favorite.\n\nAnother highlight among the new stuff is the Four Sea Interludes from Peter Grimes by Benjamin Britten, performed under conductor Neeme Jarvi. These are great pieces, although the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/performances-by-Leonard-Bernstein-in-the-last-concert-before-his-death\/dp\/B000001GEY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">performances by Leonard Bernstein in the last concert before his death<\/a>&nbsp;remain my favorite.\n\nFinally, there are a range of modern tracks by Scandinavian, German and Japanese composers that I found of interest -- pieces by Masakazu Natsuda, Klaus Jckle, Carin Malmlf-Forssling, Pehr Henrik Nordgren, Dag Wirn, Kalevi Aho, Markus Zahnhausen, Erna Tauro, Einojuhani Rautavaara, and Yoshinao Nakada are all well off the beaten path and I was more than happy to pay a couple of bucks to hear this new-to-me music. I can't promise that you'll love all of it -- I didn't either -- but hearing new things is welcome.\n\nTotal download size is 938 MB. Bitrates are variable and average 159-240 kbps.\n\nRecommended for anyone at the Daily Deal price. There is a lot of great music here.\n\nNote that it is no longer possible to see who the composers are on the individual tracks, even when you click on the individual songs.

Buy that one.","9463":"I must have been drunk when I ordered this, it's some of the worst music I've ever heard. This album is proof positive that anyone without talent can sell music.  All they have to do is work in a organ store, borrow a few hooks from semi popular songs and then mix the two.  White noise on the TV is more enjoyable to listen to.  DO NOT BUY THIS.","9464":"This is a bunch of muzak-like covers. And NOT the band AWOLNATION like I originally thought. The band is Symphony Cafe. The name of the album is only (maybe) coincidentally the same name as the Aaron Bruno's AWOLNATION. Don't buy thinking any of this will be on the same level as SAIL.","9465":"very authentic Jewish traditional from what is now northern Romania and southern ukrain once besarabia region ruled by Austria empire.","9466":"Music created the perfect atmosphere for our Seder dinner","9467":"Someone put a cut from this track on a YouTube vid. I liked it. Had no idea that the track they played was a loop from one part of this horrendous song.","9468":"He is just too talented. Can't wait for the second album, he seems to know how to make music,a powerful lyricist too.","9469":"Great compilation. Worth the money on iTunes.","9470":"Don't get thins it is mest up i","9471":"first song was great,","9472":"Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver sing 1 of their best songs ever!!! ABSOLUTE PERFECTION!!\nthe most played and enjoyed album of my Christmas season. THANKS!","9473":"Great song","9474":"Good clean, edited version of this popular hip hop song. Buy this if you want the original song with a version that could be played on the radio.","9475":"it's a re-do, not the original.....","9476":"I found out that you or somebody, is pretty slick, the guy had 1 hit \"feelings\", the rest are some old guy singing a song that if put out at the time would have bombed. Then I find out you can't get the song Unless you pay $10 for the album. What a RIP OFF!!!  There are way too many songs to fall for that con game you and other music download places or the record industry are playing.","9477":"Loved the song when I first heard it and still enjoy listening to it today.  Great song that never gets old.","9478":"Terrible use of the sample! he ruined that song for me, Nicki minaj is actually pretty good with the beat but not sean skip this!!","9479":"When I first heard that Nicki Minaj would be on the remix I thought she would be a good addition to the track. Wrong. Her verse just isn't good and sounds like she didn't take any time to at least think about what she was going to say. I have really enjoyed her music and her guest spots on other artists songs so I did have high hopes. Oh well. Stick with the original album version.","9480":"This is a great album!! I left the cd in the disc player in a car that I sold, I wanted to kick myself. I had to have it again.","9481":"When you have been around as long as this group, staying fresh without losing your unique identity and sound is a real challenge.  However, this album is undeniable proof that it can be done!  I not only enjoyed compositions and performances on almost every track, but also was delighted to find the signature \"Mint Condition\" sound meshed with unprecedented nuances on every track as well!  Over 26 years of work and still producing mint condition R&B...impressive indeed!","9482":"I purchased this cd because I had faith in this long time favorite group of mines. I really don't have the funds to waste, but I wanted to support this group. Bottomline, very disappointed. Ther are only 2 songs that I like on the whole cd.  I will stick with purchasing individual tracks, lesson learned.","9483":"The hook in the chorus is known for sticking in your brain. Fortunately, that's not a bad thing. I believe it's a remake of a 50's Sinatra classic. The group imulates that era very well, is so smooth and blend so well, you can't help from getting into a festive mood. The chorus is now my wife's ringtone. She loves it.","9484":"I kept hearing the beat w\/the MC Hammer sample under it as folks were riding by, it became addictful... however the lyrics (if you can call them that are made of the WACK crap that is passing for rap these days, i should've known better)","9485":"This is the full English version of the song. I really enjoy it. I'm not a huge GG fan, but this is awesome.","9486":"I give this group its rating because the music didn't do it for me. It seemed as if it was a cloned from the a group from the 70's.","9487":"I thought I might like this on the download, however, it was very disappointing, I do not care too much for this song.","9488":"I saw Josh and his band perform live in Michigan this past summer, with Shelagh Brown opening for him.  Josh is great and his band definitely rocks - but this song, super-charged by Shelagh's powerful harmonies and solo verse, really is the highlight of the new CD.  I still can't believe they didn't do this duet live at the Michigan show, but I am hopeful that it will turn up on the next leg of his tour, with Shelagh Brown as his special guest.  What a stunning track!  I can't wait to hear what else Shelagh has in store for us!","9489":"This is my favorite Kari Kimmel album. Solid through out","9490":"Horrible noise i'm shocked people make money off this garbage.\nI hope that this cRap is taken off this website.","9491":"Great song. In my opinion for his first album Meek Mill killed this song. Can't wait for his second album to come out.","9492":"It didn't download right and ended up wasting money. I don't know if this happens to everybody or not. Better luck next time i guess.","9493":"One of her best vocal work.","9494":"meh","9495":"I thankfully avoided purchasing this album, having nearly done so without bothering to sample the songs, which to me would be almost unthinkable but that speaks to my absolute enthusiasm for the (dead) possibility of a beautifully-packaged and unknown side project by the prog metal band, Periphery.\n\nIf Periphery's metal could be said to have a polar opposite, this could arguably be it.  This album might even be a joke.  I'm not even sure if this is passable fare for fans of low-fi polka, if that's what this is, if such fans even exist.","9496":"Casio driven keyboard crap from Eastern Europe somewhere.  It's terrible.  I ordered it because I thought it was the progressive metal band of the same name but neglected to sample any tracks first.","9497":"Another great collaboration","9498":"Good song!","9499":"Guercoeur is a beautiful Opera seldom played. This is the only recording available on CD for now. The sound quality is far from good and the interpretation is uninspired. However, until Michel Plasson's recording becomes available this is the only way to discover this masterpiece.","9500":"One of my fave albums.  A wonderful classic band. Great tunes. Excellent performances and a lovely in your living room feel. I miss these guys.","9501":"Maybe it is, but this doesn't sound like the original version I remember from years ago, which I was hoping to get.","9502":"I ordered Epic and All the Rage! came instead. It would be fine, but I already have All the rage... This is what I got..","9503":"great music","9504":"I was looking for vocals of well known Thanksgiving songs but this is just piano music.  I did not find it very inspirational.\nWe Gather Together by Craig Duncan is inspirational though it too has no vocals.","9505":"A fantastic debut album that is brooding without being pessimistic or pretentious, the lyrics are haunting, and the sounds are fresh.  The entire album flows evenly and each track is consistent without sounding the same.  Definitely a keeper for any fan of EBM who digs Haujobb, Seabound, De\/Vision and others.","9506":"Very relaxing, wonderful to listen to while you unwind or read or just to use as background.","9507":"I love a good organ version of this piece.  This perfomance is wonderful.  a b c d e f g","9508":"Punk meets rock meets vaudeville.  Seriously, this is some of the most original rock music I've heard in the last decade.  The album works from the first track to the last and you'll find yourself singing along with it days later.  Definitely worth a listen.","9509":"It was ok for the price. Some old school cd are not like the vinyl records.","9510":"Love Isaac Hayes and this is a great collection!","9511":"Merchandise cancelled with both parties in agreement.","9512":"The talented musicians playing with Susan Werner help make this recording a delightful listening experience.","9513":"This recording is not under the direction of Josef Krips. He never led the soloists. Omega has released a fake.","9514":"\"America\" is a jazzy response to the 9\/11 events. It's more of an indictment of America's various national sins. It also has a spoken word poetic section.","9515":"I've studied and practiced qi gong and hypnotherapy for about ten years now and always look into continuing education. I decided to buy this mp3 download because of Dean Evanson name on the label since I like some of his music. But as soon as I started listening I was totally put off by the cave echo sound effect and oversimplistic and amateur female narration of guided meditation.  Those completely new to reiki or any sort of energy healing might actually find this recording helpful.","9516":"Love the beginning of this song. Really feel the power of the song in the singer's voice. Not only am I feeling myself but I am feeling the hard rock to this jam!","9517":"Inspirational, motivational, uplifting, and just awesome! I always enjoy good praise\/worship music. Great pick me upper! I know churches will be singing this soon.","9518":"I only bought one track from this album hoping to calm\nme while I try to meditate but it was very distracting\nand the flute sound was not smooth. Not sure if other\ntracks are better but last track which I bought did not\ndo it for me! I had to turn it off to get my concentration\nback.","9519":"Our family loves this new album by Dan Bates.  Each arrangement is thoughtful, unique, fun and masterfully performed.  You won't be disappointed.","9520":"I started to like Paul Izak when my mother sent me his website in an email. I checked it out, and loved the vibe of the site, and of course, I loved the music. I first thought he was all reggae, but this album actually switches from reggae to blues as the songs go on. I really enjoy it, and plan to buy more of his stuff.","9521":"This cd is amazing!  Kim adds her own talent and charm to the music.  And you will love the song with her son.  Must have for Christmas cd's!","9522":"another man whose music is tops","9523":"Ordered by accident","9524":"I was trying to purchase a cd and ended up with something to put on an mp3 of which I don't even know it is.  No phone number to call, no way I could see to cancel the order and try to purchase a cd.","9525":"Nice Hawaiian music!","9526":"Not funny.  I just did not find it funny at all.","9527":"Disappointed in breast feeding jokes. Was looking forward to playing it in car on trips with my three teenage grandkids. Whoa... That's not going to happen !","9528":"I like this song, especially during Cairo. More for the music than the lyrics.","9529":"Worst Ghost Walk ever! When I get a Ghost Walk I want to hear about ghosts not a history lesson. There were no ghosts in any of the parts we listened to but in all honesty we turned it off after about the fourth 'history' lesson. Completely misnamed but they probably called it that because if they called it Ybor City History Lesson no one would buy it.","9530":"Gene Pitney was a class act with great songs in his career. If you are a Pitney fan \"Backstage\" is a must for your jukebox.","9531":"love","9532":"Boy was THIS low quality!  Can barely hear it and it sounds grainy.","9533":"This album will not download. I have never had this problem downloading any other MP3 through amazon. I'm unhappy because it is in my amazon cloud, but I can't get it downloaded to my itunes. ???? UNHAPPY!","9534":"Beautiful! Just beautiful!","9535":"Better than the first volume, which I thought would be impossible, since it had been the best Latin jazz collection I'd heard. And after the slightly disappointing second volume, I didn't have high expectations for this volume. But it delivers. In spades. Buy it.","9536":"Mozart is great.","9537":"A great song.","9538":"I am a big fan of house mix of old standards. Not many in the USA are familiar with the Cumbia genre, so this may be lost on them. But the unmistakable Cumbia comes through in a festival sort of way, as though you are walking through the streets of Bogata during Carnival, passing by various music venues... I was pleasantly delighted by this music that I grew to love living in Panama. Now here it is for your listening pleasure in a house mix to make it palatable for the mass audience!","9539":"it was a great songs & I enjoy them","9540":"The audio on this is horrible.  It has a lot of static.  I played the same  item on Apple music and there is no static.  Don't buy this item!","9541":"I just kept going back to this song. Didn't get tired of it. Wish I heard  more of the album, but it's not available.","9542":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD FROM AMAZON!\nUnless you want to listen to songs that end abruptly, a good 1 to 2 minutes before they are supposed to.  I already had three songs from this album, so I thought I'd get the rest, but all the songs end before they're supposed to.  They don't even fade away.  ridiculously shoddy service from Amazon.","9543":"It's like fresh new sounds from Africa.","9544":"This is my current favorite collection of '70s Nigerian band music. The sound quality is a little rough, maybe less clear than the three NIGERIA '70s albums, but the musicians are good and the total sound is attractive and a little strange, as if it's drifting in on some magic radio from another time and place. A pleasing stew with bits of heavy reverb, oddly tuned horn sections, nice solos and great grooves.\n\nAs a thumbnail description: It's a mix of bands. Overall closer to Sunny Ade than Fela. There are also hints of music from other parts of Africa, like Les Bantous de la Capital.\n\nDon't let the slightly lo-fi sound put you off if you like the music in the samples. Go for the musicianship and atmosphere. ymmv.\n\np.s. ... There's some nice solo trumpet on one track (\"Feso jaiye\"), and i'm wondering if this is Lester Bowie from the Art Ensemble of Chicago, who said in an interview that he lived in Lagos for a while and met Fela.","9545":"I love toccata and fugue but when I purchased this particular one, the little preview clip they let you listen too was deceiving: not only is the song a lot shorter than I remember, it's also REALLY fast. That was my problem with it; if only you could slow it down do that one could actually hear the song and recognize its distinctive and often pretty parts. This version goes so fast that the song is utterly ruined and almost all enjoyment of it is destroyed. I gave it a 2 star rating becsuse it isn't complete garbage:; and I'll still listen to it, but I'll also hate looking at that ugly cover art that's for sure.","9546":"Ernest Tubb was one of the best with one of the best bands ever. His distinctive, sometimes off key, vocals are just fabulous and his band stellar. I want as much of the Troubadours as I can afford in my collection.","9547":"this is a great song, it is emotional at the start and then gets a little more classical and uplifting towards the end. I would recommend it to any person who is down and needs a song to help them feel better and more empowered","9548":"If you are a pedal steel guitar fan this is a great CD.","9549":"Narrator\/Reader not adept to reading aloud. Yawns while reading.  Book at Mid-level understanding, hard to understand\/follow with reader.\nBetter off to obtain hard copy, read for ones self.","9550":"One of my favorite Christmas songs","9551":"Good song just in time for Christmas...Jesus #1","9552":"It's a joyful, fun Christmas song with the true meaning of Christmas. Easy enough for children to sing and enjoy,  as well.","9553":"that's not what I was looking for","9554":"Most of the songs in this set of Christmas classics are adaptations of the originals. Some of these updates I really like. Some were a little too much \"out there\". I really love the track \"Born is the King\"! It's very upbeat and inspiring! Very well done! Overall these are nice tracks for the Christmas season.","9555":"Beautiful Christmas music with Hillsong's signature sound. This album rocked my whole Christmas season! The one original song is beautiful, and the traditional carols are done in a unique way. Only complaint would be that it is only 8 tracks (7 songs), but the price is fitting. I highly recommend buying this.","9556":"Inferior sound when played back on my iPod. Next time i will invest more money and get a better production.","9557":"I had to put one star in order to write to you.  The song did not download to my MP3 player.","9558":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD FROM AMAZON!\nUnless you want to listen to songs that end abruptly, a good 1 to 2 minutes before they are supposed to. I already had two songs from this album, so I thought I'd get the rest, but all the songs end before they're supposed to. They don't even fade away. ridiculously shoddy service from Amazon.","9559":"ugh, i deleted it. out of tune in some parts. thought it was the real thing when i bought it.","9560":"I love this music","9561":"SURPRISE!!! When the CD is loaded into the player, a foreign couple show up as the digital cover of the CD and all the songs are listed in a foreign language. The CD plays fine with the Beegie Adair & Friends music - (there are no glitches in the CD). I have no idea who Lonny and Sandra are, but I have a feeling I'm going to find out.","9562":"It's not that I don't like this album, I like sefyu's style but this album had nothing special compared to the previous album I heard form him.","9563":"Sounds like it was written for 8 year olds who don't have access to a radio.  Poor Verve Pipe, what have you done?","9564":"I don't like Elvis impersonators.","9565":"I have spent the last few nights listening and reminiscing to Elvis's old songs and if I could I would add a few more stars to the rating up above. They have brought back such wonderful memories. God, I miss him! I can't say anything bad about his music or his movies. There will never be another performer like him. This song sounds exactly the way I remembered it, I just couldn't get enough of it. I could play it over and over again, just wish the songs were longer then I wouldn't have to keep replaying ha ha! The quality is great and they sound so good it makes me now, want to buy all his movies! If you love Elvis and you have memories then you will love his music & movies. Fantastic digitals & remakes.\n\nP.S It's great to be able to download individual favorites (mp3's ) instead of having to purchase full c\/d's","9566":"Groovy sound, funny lyrics, slightly dark but apropos. I like the male vocals on \"Mom and Dad, can I keep it?\"","9567":"Fun, light song from a great band. You don't have to physically be a kid to enjoy Cereal. Or, if you DO have wee little ones...","9568":"Great folky rock from Brooklyn","9569":"I PLAY SEVERAL VINYL PARTIES A YEAR AND BROKE MY COPY OF THIS 45. JUST A GREAT OLDIE THAT SHAGGERS AND\nSWINGER DANCERS LOVE.","9570":"Great classic \"oldies\" song!","9571":"I loved the anime, and I loved the song.  I especially liked the track which had one of the recurring themes.","9572":"Everyone should know the rich elegant pianism of Carl Perkins , who died just 30 years. Few records concerning him ( memorable ones with guitarist Oscar Moore ) .","9573":"Here I was hoping to listen to two classic rare recordings by a duo who had one of the biggest hits of 1969. Well after listening, it was hard to tell if I was listening to a CD or an old album that someone had used as a frisbee sometime. There are more snaps, clicks, pops,skips & scratches on this CD then my old record albums. This is just another rip-off import CD put together by someone looking to make a fast buck. There is no quality on this CD because basically it is two very used albums transferred directly to disc. Don't waste your money here. Hopefully someone in the future will put out these gems in some form of remastering. The music is still worth waiting for.","9574":"Why?  Because it downloaded 8 copies when I asked for one, and each of those were only 25 seconds long.  The first 25 seconds of the song.  And then to make thing weirder an unwanted copy of another performance was also downloaded with it, but it looks like I was only charged for this one.","9575":"This terrific collaboration with Dash Berlin is sure to set any dance floor moving.  The production has interesting feel which is both driving and elastic.  A great addition to any DJ set.","9576":"Doesn't quite hit the volume you need for a newborn.  Prime music has some better options.  Love this guys calm baby instructional videos though","9577":"This rain was disappointing, it doesn't sound like rain","9578":"Just found out that Jet had disbanded so I thought I would check out what the brothers were doing.  Not impressed, but only listened to the samples.  I think the doom-disco is just that...doom...","9579":"The first time I heard Wild Child was right before they played a local music festival in August of 2014. One of the first songs I remember hearing was Pillow Talk and it stuck with me. It's been a year and a half and I have seen them live one other time. Their music is usually upbeat but the lyrics are about heartbreak, relationship issues or destructive behavior. The ukulele played by Alex makes you want to go skipping down the sidewalk but when you listen to the lyrics they can be haunting. Kelsey has a beautiful voice both recorded and in person. She has a lot of passion and you can hear it when she sings. When Alex sings with her their voices blend amazingly well. You would think they were a couple but really they just make beautiful music together.","9580":"Love Wild Child","9581":"Saw them in concert in LA and was very impressed. The next day I bought their album and have shared it with many people.","9582":"I saw this band as an opener on New Years Eve 2012 and fell in love. The album was just a pleasing as the performance. The eclectic mix of instruments flows together beautiful and perfectly excentuates the two singers, one male and one female. The music is somewhat reminiscent of one of my favorite bluegrass band, Elephant Revival, so if you like a Wild Child they're worth checking out.","9583":"THis is my JAM! Awesome Song","9584":"It sounds very manufactured.","9585":"I was in the Ecko store when I first heard this song.  Subsequently, I bought the mp3 off Amazon.com.  I've been in heaven ever since, literally.","9586":"New favorite song.  I like how it has an old school feel, yet new and fresh for today. I enjoy it.","9587":"Love Sean Paul .","9588":"This is Sean Paul at his best! I've never heard Dancehall as moving as this! It's everything you crave from Sean Paul and more. It definitely sets the mood.","9589":"This is a good dance song. It's a good stress reliever. I love the beat. Just buy the song if you like to dance","9590":"very good song","9591":"Bless this man.","9592":"I used it once, it didn't help my baby sleep, but I didn't try it until 3 months old. The \"hissy\" fan works just fine for her","9593":"Don't waste your money on this...my baby didn't like any of the white noise.  It would make her cry even more!","9594":"Love it!  Great song.","9595":"I was in either Tilly's or Ecko at Pembroke Lakes Mall when I first heard this tune.  Subsequently, I bought the mp3 off Amazon.com.  I've been in heaven ever since, literally!","9596":"I recently got this EP from one of the members in MagSauce, Chad, and I was extremely surprised at how wonderful this CD is since I was told it was a really cheap recording. It sounds amazing! As far as the music, Chad told me that they pull a lot of influence from Rush and prog. bands of the like, but I also hear a space rock sound, like from some of the Cave In CDs. If you are into prog. rock, you really need to buy this cd. These are also awesome guys, so help them out. You will not be disappointed!","9597":"It is only the first movement.  You have to buy the other two separately.  Then you have to start each movement which ruins the listening experienced. Don't.  Bother with this one.","9598":"Yes!","9599":"I've been listening to Between Two Worlds since I downloaded the album early Sunday morning. Every track is a Gem! Great Jazz, with a Fine Latin touch. Makes you feel good listening to it. With that special someone this Album will make it a very special night !","9600":"i ' m REGULAR CUSTOMER many years HMV.CO.JP ...,i ' m regular customer RAKUTEN.CO.JP..., i ' m regular customer AMAZON.CO.JP...this is absolutely full reliable, trustworthy global company...! All that I have bought, on this company's , brand new, in perfect condition all very carefully packed...!!! and NOW...cd s  without Rolls Air Bag,no protection !,  dusty jewel case... Packaging plastic box is scratched and worn with cracks and broken in and cd drive it freely hanging...! LOOK  AT YOURSELVES...you just savages...! THIS IS  I'll  NEVER FORGET...i have very long chinese memory !  N.B. MS.SOMA    -  HABIBY  DAH  , simply WONDER...!, for HER FIVE  STARS !","9601":"... if you get a chance, listen to the accoustic version of this song taped in the UK during a live radio promo.  Fantastic!  The song truly displays Avril's singing capability.  Aside from that, the song is infectious.","9602":"I tried very hard to get a DVD, but this turned out to be a CD. Not the same, I didn't get much use out of it and had to reorder the DVD.","9603":"First of all, the store where I bought it from, sent it with signature verification, forcing me to find time from work in order to receive it and sign it.  After all that, hoping to hear the remix that is next to impossible to get, unless you buy the CD single, the remix version had a european discotheque sound.  It was awful, disappointing....I had hoped the remix would sound more like a Latino, flamenco, rhythmic or tropical sound, oh well, it was too much to ask.","9604":"I was under the impression that this was a DVD because of the price, thirty-seven dollars and change.  It was just a CD.  A little expensive....","9605":"The album has been at the top of my \"most listened to\" list for weeks (Another thanks to Hype Machine for exposing me to this talented artist). I can't wait for Vows to be released the US. If you have the chance, go see her in concert - especially with collaborator Gotye. Her vocal compositions and range are impressive. Buy and enjoy!","9606":"This song has a caribbean-type rhythm that is perfectly matched to Kem's smooth vocals. An upbeat tune, the lyrics are so pure and full of love....you can hear and feel every emotion that he is singing about.  I absolutely love Kem's music and encourage you to buy this entire album!  Excellent!!!!","9607":"Not his best but well worth a listen.","9608":"I downloaded this album for a halloween party and was very disappointed.  From the samples I thought the songs would be cool dupstep remixes of classic well known halloween songs, but they were terrible.  I had to turn it off because people and my party were complaining. DO NOT BUY!!! WASTE OF MONEY!!!!","9609":"It was the 80s, I lived through it, a great decade as far as I'm concerned. Awesome song by an iconic 80s band, that sounds great remastered. RATT N ROLL.","9610":"I don't recommend this cd. It is not worth the price","9611":"Great music","9612":"the product is well packaged and well made. the photobook is really thick and good quality.\nthe first includes remakes of past shinee songs, like lucifer and juliette, as well as new songs, like stranger","9613":"crap","9614":"The Kidneythieves have long been a favorite group of mine, and I was very happy to hear they had finally released a followup to their spectacular Zerospace album.  Comments about a few of the tracks:\n\nJude (Be Somebody) - great song, great message.  Check out the acoustic version on Youtube.\nFreeky People - my favorite on the album.  It manages to be catchy and aggressive at the same time.\nVelveteen - chill vibe mixed with bursts of rock. Unique sound.  I like it.\nDark Horse - nice lyrics.\n\nIf you like this check out their followup release The Invisible Plan, which is really really good.","9615":"this was not the tune i was expecting.  I should have listened to it before I got it.  An entire waste of a dollar.","9616":"Add it to her list of hits!! I love this song. It makes me move and groove everytime I hear it. A must have for your family reunion playlist or outside gathering event!!!!","9617":"I LOOOOOVE this song!!! The beat goes so HARD!!! Her vocals are AMAZING!!! The song is just....THE ISH!!! Pure HOTNESS!!! I can't wait for the whole album to drop! I know it's going to do great and I'm so proud of her!!! <3","9618":"Very beautiful, however there is a technical problem. It's not loud enough--I have to turn the volume (with Bose head wear) to listen to the words. But I still give it a B++++","9619":"I just saw her live performance and WOW ! She is great! What a voice..thoroughly enjoyed all her songs!\nI have not heard anyone this good in a long time!","9620":"Stefanie Keys' latest album, Dead Horse Road, is a kick-ass masterpiece. Keys delivers an expressiveness that is rich, soulful, and rings emotionally true.","9621":"Great indie album.  Manny has a great voice.  Always and As Long As I'm With You are my favorites.","9622":"This really sux, it sounds like a Jr High School band playing this while eating lunch. Don't buy any of this crap.","9623":"I was just surfing around the Tube of You when I found the video Fat Mermaid. That in turn brought me to Porkchop and Flatscreen. The videos were really funny and I loved them. It was the music though that stuck in my head. To the point that I just had to have it. It is so unique and smooth. I just fell head over heels. This album rules. I have had it on repeat since I bought it and I share the song B.U.S.T. with everyone. So far in my completely unorthodox and informal survey it has been a unanimous hit. Just wonderful chill and not so chill tunes. I am looking forward to more from Emezie.","9624":"the music is there, in the sense that an old Nokia ringtone might sound like the song you were wanting.","9625":"Nothing against the London Philharmonic Orchestra, it's just that this is a tame & lame version of composer Inon Zur's music as heard in the opening \"slideshow sequence\" when Fallout 3 starts (before you load a game).\nDoes anyone know where I can get a copy of this theme as it is heard in the game?","9626":"I had to confirm that this was actually the LPO playing this, because honestly it was terrible. I'm guessing there were probably issues with the conductor and a shortage of rehearsals, but really I wish I hadn't paid for this. The orchestra has absolutely no balance, and the sound is massively processed that... well I couldn't tell if it was a real orchestra or not, and I am an absolute freak about classical music.","9627":"...we all do.  A great sound track for our lives.  Great gaming music is not only a nostalgic ride to bygone days in one's alternative universe, it also lends that missing element of danger and excitment to the dull routines of this world. Get a little Liberi Fatali going, and picking up your underwear becomes a noble quest.","9628":"This is a scam! There is no audio! Just silence! Refund my money!","9629":"Awesome music like always. YFS and GOM always goes in. Kingdom Music stepping up the music game. Glory be to God","9630":"The sound quality on the sample cut of  When The Night Comes Falling From The Sky does not seem\nto be the same as that on the mp3 that downloaded! Too much noise, modulation and general background\ndisruption. You might look somewhere else for a better cut of this great song. Oh, I would only add that i think Jeff Healey did his best in a pretty 'modest' setting!!","9631":"This MP3 is corrupt and skips throughout the second half of the song. Do not buy this one until Amazon fixes it.","9632":"Im a christian myself and at times we try so hard to be the best we can be do we can lead folks to chris jesus that we forget that we need to find the time to be ministered to ourselves...this so spoke to my spirit...deeply...great job!!!","9633":"Don't waste your money.","9634":"This cd has some of the best songs from the 90's - Why You Getting Funky is an absolute favorite. I am so happy to have found it!","9635":"The best music ever written at a bargain price. What's not to like?","9636":"amazing price, great listening","9637":"this is not historia calamitatum as made famous by rise against, this is toxic as made famous by britney spears","9638":"Great.","9639":"To hear this song makes me think of a wedding reception in a tent with lots of candles, so beautiful and romantic.  I LOVE this song.","9640":"Luke from Star Wars is my favorite character in that movie.  I like Star Wars.  I liked it even more in 3-D!  (but I lost my glasses.)  I ordered this CD and I cannot wait to hear it!  God Bless.","9641":"This song is catchy and well written. The musicians are clearly top-notch. Congrats on a job well done.","9642":"I looked at this thinking, \"Cool, the soundtrack for that crazy movie!\" WRONG!!!!!! The only thing \"Hobo\" about this is the title and the first track. Other than that, it's just a bunch of annoying rap  that defiles the spirit of the movie. Don't waste you time even listening to the preview tracks. I'd give it no star, but the rating scales makes you give it at least one. Waste.","9643":"I am a Brubeck fan from my high school days.\nI thought i was geting the first music cut on this cd.\nHowever what I got was 37 seconds of applause.\nI want a refund.  I give it minus one star.","9644":"he sure doesn't sound like the original song","9645":"First of all...I was in a punk band called the FLARE UPs who wrote these songs. I wrote these songs only the dude who stole themfrom me, remixed them with some of his garbage tracks and put this out. I was robbed..please don't support this...It is honestly terrible anyway..check out the real FLARE UPS on youtube to see what we were REALLY about","9646":"Very bad...so bad...I  pay for \"Nuevamente Boleros\" but the disc inside say \"Tania Libertad\" Boleros...and when I  put in the cd player sound Susan Boyle...I want my money back...because that's not the item i want it...","9647":"i prefer to listen the original singer Rie Fu's version.","9648":"Don't waste your money","9649":"Bought it for True Love Gone by the Enchanters (had it on 78rpm), but the rest of the c.d. is great listening. Esp. the songs by the Demensions. Sound quality is great. Recommend for those looking for the un-heard doo-wops out there.","9650":"Had maybe 2 or 3 decent scary songs. Others were just sound effects, and lame at that. Disappointed.","9651":"Not what I expected, wanted sounds, not music","9652":"Wished it was more scary","9653":"KO does no wrong they are simply the perfect band. Perfect, buy this record...buy them all. Buy them all. All of them.","9654":"Mostly sung by adults. I thought it was poor quality.","9655":"How DO you go on Princess? Moving from one scam to the next, never paying the debts you rack up as you drift through life. But the world owes you, right Anji? You're nothing but a parasite, a tick, sucking what you need from everyone you come in contact with. Shame on you, you religeous hypocrite. How do you look yourself in the mirror?","9656":"\"How DO you go on\", you religious hypocrite? Don't give this deadbeat scammer one dime. This 'professional tenant' parasite grifter skipped out owing her last landlord thousands in unpaid rent and property damage. On the run ahead of multiple debt and civil suits. Owes tens of thousands to the IRS, hospitals, multiple retailers, collection agencies. The worst kind of religious hypocrite.","9657":"Strong, individual performance.","9658":"Infectious beat ... can't help moving my body! A new favorite on my Belly Dance playlist","9659":"Wonderful Brazilian classic. Love this version.","9660":"This man is amazing!  He was great even BEFORE he appeared on \"The Voice\".  Once you hear him sing, you will continue to buy his CD's.  Enjoy!","9661":"Don't waste your money.  The CD is about ten minutes long and really had nothing of the Clarence Clemons playing ability that I'm used to.  I contacted Amazon for how to return it and they very graciously refunded my money.","9662":"Clarence \"Big Man\" Clemons sending us all a Christmas card from heaven. That sweet soulful sax will be missed but never matched. We thank you for the music.","9663":"Great album from a great songwriter - full of emotion and stories that are from the heart. Destined to be an album that you listen to over and over again.","9664":"The title is not meant to be an attack on someone's sexuality or homosexuality in general. So go ahead and get that out of your mind right now. (Go ahead. Clear your mind. I'll wait.)\n\n There. now if you would just take the time to listen to the words, you will find one hell of a good song. It's a song about Billybob wishing to find himself a good woman (Or any woman for that matter) and to address the rumors swirling in the fan community about his sexuality. (Why anyone would want to put a sexual preference on a fictitious character is beyond me)\n\n I was quite surprised by this song. Aaron Fechter crafted a simple yet beautiful song. Well worth the 99 cents!\n\n So buy this song and giggle. And don't look too deeply into it.","9665":"Who cares? Billy Bob just wants to clear the rumor. Makes sense to me. People need to quit trying to ban words, especially when its in a complicated context like this where you have to know backstory. This is a gift to all of the Rockafire fans, who never dreamed they would be able to buy NEW songs by Rockafire Explosion!","9666":"I had to fight with it for all the songs to download. The kids didn't care too much for it and thr Rudolph yhe red nised reindeer does not start out right.","9667":"1st Heavy Pets album purchase.  #win 3am & A bog and his doy are tasty treats.  Enjoy","9668":"great new album...straight from jump with 3am! a departure from their typical live sound but demonstrates their tasteful, compelling songwriting. love it...perfect to chill out to. hope you enjoy!","9669":"Really like all of seals music.  Haven't heard anything from him lately but he has a beautiful voice.  Great artist.","9670":"In theory this would be a wonderful purchase but in fact it is not in proper fusha Arabic but Arabic with Egyptian pronunciation. This means for example the song about Hajj is sung Hagg!!!! Allah yahdeehum! Unless you know this dialect then your kids will have difficulty understanding it. Please Noorart, what were you thinking????","9671":"excellent","9672":"I LOVE this music! I LOVE the songs! I don't want MP3. I want a physical CD that I can play in my car, on my stereo, or on my laptop! I'm going to keep hoping it will be released in a format that will make me happy :)","9673":"I hadn't really wanted to order the whole album...just one song.  I'm not very happy about the whole album being downloaded and being charged for it, but what can I do?  I don't really care for any of the other songs.","9674":"Love it and it sounds great!","9675":"Dzyan played some uniquely powerful Kosmische prog! As hard-hitting as Guru Guru and as eclectic as Agitation Free, but with serious jazz chops approaching Mahavishnu-land. The music is alternately spacy\/exotic and busy\/crisp - the most effective blending of psychedelia and true jazz that one is likely to hear anywhere.","9676":"Celtic Thunder introduced him to me...what a beautiful voice this gentleman has! I love this song and I love the way he sings it!","9677":"Was not happy with it sorry","9678":"My pre-ballet students really wanted to dance to scary music for Halloween. This was the perfect CD. The kids had a blast dancing like skeletons and zombies.","9679":"I bought this because my students wanted to listen to music while they worked on a project.  I knew this wasn't what they expected.  It achieved my desired effect","9680":"Love this rendition!","9681":"No idea - this song was not memorable or I'd be able to review it ... instead it seems like I downloaded and forgot after listening. That's a meaningful statement.","9682":"Once again the beauty of Maysa's voice caresses the ear with her distinct style. She charms you with her sound and keeps you wanting to hear more.","9683":"My most favorite pianist....from the UK.  If you are not familiar with her music then you need to be.  Soulful and soothing.  You would not be disappointed.  My father had the love of flying and I think of him everytime I hear this particular song.  WONDERFUL","9684":"I purchased this song because my girls needed to to practice the dance team tryout routine.  This is suck a cute song!","9685":"My 2 girls 3 and 7 love this song. They play it everyday and know all the words. Great job!!!!!","9686":"This is a great song.","9687":"Love this remake.","9688":"If I had known this album was mainly cover songs, I wouldn't have bought it. It isn't marked on the cover of the album, which I bought at a record store. Meh.","9689":"Bought this album for my seven year Bieber fan but I must say I am a fan of this album as well! Christmas Eve is one of my favorite songs on the album.","9690":"Very relaxing and calming.","9691":"I love this song sooo much. If you like Justin Bieber and Christmas songs then you'll love this song .","9692":"The original one is awesome but this one is amazing and so entertaining and has beats and just wants to make you dance","9693":"After listening to the original version numerous times I need something to add some edginess. The Dave Aude Club Mix definitely fits the bill. Great for dance and working out to.","9694":"If you enjoy true worship,with heart,soul and sincerity to usher the presence of God through soothing melodic gospel music. This is a perfect selection. I enjoy this one.","9695":"Amazing instrumental guitar album from one of the founding members of Warumpi Band. Moody and atmospheric, it's the perfect background music when I am doing some writing don't want the words of a song to distract me from the words on my screen.\n\nRecommended for fans of the Warumpis, and those (like me) who enjoy the instrumental music released by various members of Midnight Oil during Peter Garrett's time away from music. (see The Break and Jim Moginie's Electric Guitar Orchestra).","9696":"ok","9697":"Great priceless oldie!","9698":"One song is actually about \"prarie puppies, one is black the other chubby\" and I don't know if he's singing about gophers or what but it's dorky and fun and actually really rocks in a lighter version of maybe a Jesus & Mary Chain sound. Very fast pop with a garagey twinge to it. If you're a serious garage person, you may find that too silly & lighthearted for you, but I love it. Although \"Miracle\" is even a little too sweet for me.","9699":"When it has came down to Beyonce's music lately, it has honestly became a bit more of a snore than something that even feels like a triumph. With the poor status of 4, she really wasn't able to thrive in the way of the diva that she made herself out to be. Her 6th single from 4, Party, feels a bit more lackluster in appeal, than strong from her voice as it could have made out to be. I really didn't like the song that much, and truthfully I think Beyonce' needs to find her voice again. I do wish her well becoming a new mother, but overall her music needs a bit of tuning up. Hopefully, there could be more of a \"swagu,\" as quoted in the song from her the next time around.\n\nSong: D+","9700":"In my opinion - one of the best and most-powerful Queen songs in existence!  Freddie Mercury really brings this track alive!!","9701":"Great at the end of the party tune because its not fast, but just right.  I think J. Cole was Beyonce's right choice for the song.  Don't be surprised hearing it blasting from the bars nearby while tanning on a caribbean island sipping on a cold glass of coconut juice with a slice of lemon wedged on the side!","9702":"When it has came down to Beyonce', she honestly has suffered with the \"senior slump\" of her album 4 not really delivering with expectations of what her past records had drawn. Sadly, the songs just don't really feel like they have even came close to hitting the nail on the head. Party, the 6th single from that album, teaming up with J. Cole, feels weak and not really filled with the substance that her fans had definitely hoped from her. I really wasn't very impressed with the song, and felt she had let her voice and drive go. I would honestly not recommend the \"Swagu\" that Beyonce' put on the song for your music library. Stick with something more addictive from her like Single Ladies instead.\n\nSong: D+","9703":"I hate this spanish version of Copa Cabana.  I wanted Barry Manilos version of this song.  Amazon, could not find it.  I was disappointed.  I don't even listen to this song.  When I ordered it, I thought it was the english version.  Shame on you Amazon.  This was the first Song I ordered and hated. I meant to say I hated that song.  Wish I could delete it from my Kindle.","9704":"Doesn't anyone else hear that this is a drum machine ?  hahaha\nWith all of the \"arguments\" from both sides NO ONE has brought this up ?  LMAO !  I see \"experienced record producers\" torn between \"who the band may be\" ...  Seriously, this is like a Casio keyboard drum sound !  Listen to the bass drum and cross stick...  It is the EXACT same way EVERY TIME .  I really doubt there were drum machines when Stuart was alive .  Can no one else tell that the drums and piano are most CERTAINLY keyboards; bad quality ones at that .  This keeps me in the doubters camp .  :~ )","9705":"I mean NOWHERE, in NO biography of the Beatles, including Mark Lewisohn's exhaustivly researched new book on their early years, have I ever heard anything about Stuart Sutcliffe ever recording anything,ever, with or without the beatles. He wasn't even there when The Beatles backed Tony Sheridan on a recording, even tho he was a member of the band still when they did. Unless whoever it is that is selling this thing wants to explain where and when, and how and with who else, don't bother. Thats my advice. Incedently, why do you think it is that there is no info on the recording details??? Nothing at all. Don't be fooled. I mean really tho, if this thing had been genuine, there would have been a cover story about it in \"Rolling Stone\". I hate people who fake this sort of thing","9706":"Sounds fake to me....\nSounds like the same singer who played Stu in Birth Of The Beatles, and it is in the same key, even if it isn't the same take. And BOTH versions are in the same key and style and tempo as Percy Sledge's 1966 cover of the tune.\nA very unlikely coincidence, IMO....\nThe chance of this song actually being Stuart Sutcliffe is pretty slim....\nI would be very interested in learning more about the provenance of the tape,\nwhere and when the instrumental overdubs were performed, and a bit more concerning the initial recording itself.\nAnd why it is that no mention, no rumor of this recording has ever been documented in the nearly 50 years since it was supposedly made, with all the intense press scrutiny of all the people surrounding the Beatles, their Hamburg days, and their friends (Klaus, Jurgen, Astrid, etc).....\nMore information needs to be forthcoming on this track.","9707":"Excellent product.  This version has much superior sound quality to others offered online.  Thank you!","9708":"I love the quiet soulfulness of this rendition of a beautiful classic.","9709":"This is the most beautiful rendition of Unchained Melody I've ever heard. It made me cry. Sensitively and masterfully sung.","9710":"This isn't the Shady 2.0 Cypher, it's some terrible garbage instead.  Amazon should really ban this type of misleading crap.","9711":"I didn't like many of the songs, but with music it's all about personal preference.","9712":"NOWHERE, in NO biography of the Beatles, including Mark Lewisohn's exhaustivly researched new book on their early years, have I ever heard anything about Stuart Sutcliffe ever recording anything,ever, with or without the beatles.

I hate people who fake this sort of thing , and this is FAKE","9713":"Didn't know who Breezy Lovejoy was but he can rap!","9714":"The three CD set sounded good in the description, but doesn't sound that good when played. The songs are seperated into tracks, but they don't have much lead in or fade out time. They almost run into each other as if not seperated by tracks. Some songs are even trunkated somewhat; some of the songs seem to be missing their begining. In short, whoever produced this set of CDs did not edit the songs very well. If I knew this before I bought the set, I would have passed on this purchase.\nMary from Ohio","9715":"you will more than likely delete more than half of the songs from this compilation. the 12 or 13 i kept are slightly above average, good enough to hold a 12 or 13 song album on their own, but all the rest is filler.","9716":"I LIKE IT","9717":"The album never downloaded. I was charged and then the site locked up. Amazon says that all songs have downloaded but they are not on my PC or in Amazon Cloud.","9718":"This download was only 42 seconds long. I called and asked for it to be resent to me because it couldn't possibly be only 42 seconds....the second time was the same as the first. What's with that?","9719":"Love it!","9720":"Cool stuff","9721":"He (and his daughter Estrelle, for that matter) goes a long way on flamboyant style, but limited vocal range.","9722":"Beautiful music","9723":"Similar to Coldplay's magnificent, Death and All His Friends from Viva La Vida. Up With the Birds, has layers that make the song wholesome. It begins with a ballad, but soon progresses to clever instrumental bird sounds. Then the melody hits, and Martin's, \"My life to go, where they don't my name\" and \"go all over the world, just to see her again\" are majestic. The Mylo Xyloto album was a bit disappointing, but this track lives up to Coldplay's abysmal songs.","9724":"This download sounds as if someone ripped it off a CD with a mic to a speaker ,its loud and echo y. The Longer track is just the intro and the sounds better then the first main track, still a little loud and booming. The first track is supposed \"main\"  track but it abruptly starts and finishes unexpectedly.\nI have bought other CD's  from Dr Rick Collin wood and they sounds way better then this.\nIt sucks.<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Insomnia-Cure-Hypnosis\/dp\/B002VLQUYQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Insomnia Cure Hypnosis<\/a>","9725":"Like \"Trapped In The Body of a White Girl\", the album really rocks and is really funny too. I love her references to Disco also. She's kind of like a female version of Weird Al Yankovic.","9726":"The music on \"Get Your Science Right\" is tempered with uncertainty and longing, suggestive of adventure, reflecting a sort of vague wisdom; it's wistful, earnest music that also feels deep, even though it really isn't. But above all it just feels happy and joyous, an explosion of warm feeling rendered in sound. It was an ideal move from a band that just a few years earlier had been a bunch of punk kids from a nowheresville called McKinney with more confidence than skill. Lush, rich, smooth, epic, emotional and utterly gorgeous are only a few of the ways to describe this work of art.  If HSATRTG were to make another album, I don't know if there will be any brain matter left in my skull to handle it.\n\nI made my girlfriend listen to this album and she birthed 7 children by the end of \"Highway to Hawaii\".","9727":"Great music,,,,From Italy 70","9728":"Killer","9729":"First heard this song on a Steins;Gate AMV. Very emotional.","9730":"censored","9731":"Great song","9732":"I'm a big Dave Stamey fan and like just about everything he does.  The songs on this album are good and fit right in with his style.","9733":"Great Song","9734":"I had the great pleasure to purchase one of the CDs and to even see the artist live in downtown Detroit. Awesome music, worth every penny!","9735":"This first CD demonstrates or shows promise, which hopefully the band reached on their subsequent two CDs, which I have not heard.  I have to give this first CD a fairly low rating for multiple reasons.  I guess first and foremost the music is all over the place.  You could probably ask a dozen different people to name a dozen different artists that the CD sounds like, and each could easily do so.  For brevity (instead of naming all the sound-a-likes), Ill just say envision King Crimson with Kate Bush as the lead vocalist.  The CD is not very long at only around 38 minutes, and it basically is just one little snippet of noise after another for the most part - lot of intense angular type noise, with little melodic breaks.  There are no extended melodies.  It sounds as though basically the group went into the studio with the sole purpose of just trying to throw in every kind of abstract, mishmash, gadgetry, off-the-wall soundscape that they could think of (you know the kitchen sink concept).  But to close on a positive note, the reason I said the CD shows promise is because the lead vocalist does have a nice voice and the playing does sound like a nice overall tight ensemble, i.e., good musicianship.  The music basically just needs to be significantly more focused, and the kitchen sink concept needs to be abandoned big time.","9736":"Live version. Tiresome to download, needs special ap. Really not worth my trouble. There are other places to get music with less hassle.","9737":"Dave Stamey is great cowboy singer\/songwriter. 12 Mile Road is a good example of his many talents.","9738":"The Item I thought I was buying was the movie and I got a CD and it wouldn't even play!","9739":"Only 13 reviews?!?!?!  How is this possible?  Did fans miss the memo?\n\nThis is clearly and unarguably Jon's best work since Yes' Magnification in 2001.  And I would go as far as to say his best solo work ever.  Jon has tapped into something very special with this piece of music.  His spirituality is forefront (as it always is) except now it is delivered by a man who is sure of who he is and the world around him, spiritually.  He has definitely evolved and 'arrived'.  The music is fantastic - developed, well-orchestrated, and filled with depth.\n\nSo why 4 stars?  Honestly?  Because as much as I love listening to \"Open\" (and I do, I listen to it often), I am often reminded of just how much MORE this song could have been had it been recorded with YES with a symphony orchestra like Magnification.  I miss full drums (not just percussion), Steve's guitar work, and obviously Chris' bass work.  Had \"Open\" been recorded wtih YES-proper, I don't think it would be an understatement to then rank it right along side of Close To The Edge, Gates Of Delerium, and Awaken because the playing that Steve, Chris and Alan would have brought to the table would have elevated this song into the stratosphere.\n\nBut regardless, this is still an inspiring and very fulfilling piece of music that will resonate and travel with me for the rest of my life.\n\nThank you Jon!!!!  Now do it again!!!!!!! LOL!","9740":"I really think this song reflects Jon Anderson. I just went to a YES concert and I was so disapointed not to se Jon Anderson in stead they hired a very young kid that sings very close to Jon's voice but never like him. Its a shame the group that I love for so many years is done. If you ask me I prefer Jon's music than what Yes is making now.","9741":"Somebody has screwed up and refuses to put Chicory Chick here as the title says. This song actually plays as... TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR, not Chicory Chick. Past complaint has not corrected the error.","9742":"While this song is not available on the normally released albums, it has great harmony and is one of my favorites by him.  I'm glad I chose to purchase this single!","9743":"Jon Anderson is utterly unique in the world of popular music.  A little too distinctive for some, but we who like his work will like \"Open.\"  This is no Yes album and the reasons are clear by contrast with \"Fly from Here,\" which is great--but very different in musical direction.  The orchestration on \"Open\" is almost overwhelming and the more sparse arrangements and production more memorable.  Please don't expect the crytalline vocals of 40 years ago--voice is a young man's game and no amount of doubling and other engineering can disguise that.  But Jon's no one-trick pony; he's become an outstanding and well-rounded musician, so the growing compositional abilities more than compensate for diminished vocals.  This is truly a Jon work.  Dig it.","9744":"This might be the best band you've never heard of. They've been at it for a long time, and the front man and writer Steve Decesare keeps putting out new material. Out of Boulder, CO. check em out live when you can, it's a great show. Until then, try one of their albums!","9745":"Luv my 80's. Thanks. Non stop","9746":"Whoops. Forgot the Flosstradamus remix is the trap anthem. This is a hardstyle track.","9747":"JoyFocus releases another fantastic Electronic Rock\/Pop album, \"Cyber Suburban Electro Rock Circus.\" JoyFocus is comprised of 2 talented artists, musician Rikk Currence and vocalist Holly Joy and together they bring to life a richly textured collection of melodic songs. Opening up the album, \"Audrey Is Gone,\" you are instantly drawn to the sweet and charming vocals while the searing guitar gives you an edgy Rock tonality. Another song, \"Grey Day My Way (war of me),\" features stirring synth strings and Electronic soundscapes swirling around the shimmering vocals and creates a magnetic melody. You will like their re-make of \"Here Comes The Rain Again,\" as this song features all the dynamic synth sounds of the original and irresistible vocals. Discover the talents of the duo JoyFocus and their outstanding Electronic Rock\/Pop music on the wonderful CD, \"Cyber Suburban Electro Rock Circus.\" [...]","9748":"What can I say?  It's Sting.  He's a musician like no other.  It's an awesome song and the arrangement stays with you.  Excellent.","9749":"I was hoping it was the original 12\" mix, but it's a dumbed down edit of the original. What's up with the sirens in the intro?!?","9750":"So this album covers all sorts of different kinds of songs and nails all of them.  It's a thoughtful approach at rock and folk.  Their new CD is even better, in my opinion.  So i am inclined to call this the best CD i've listened to this year.  Hope you enjoy it as much as i did.","9751":"Perfect Halloween song!","9752":"really bad recording quality even though it said remastered, but it was a bad recording mix","9753":"I wanted the english version and assumed it was . It didn't say it was in spanish","9754":"I was so looking for this song and I finally got it. ahh great memories of the 80's, that is early 80's","9755":"Great product as usual.","9756":"Bigfoot is hiding out in the dark woods... and this song should be right out there with him. Pathetic attempt at music!","9757":"As a submariner, Tommy's songs bring back fond memories of the good times aboard the boats. Easy download and high quality sound. I couldn't be happier with this product and service.","9758":"Won't download onto my phone same with other songs I bought","9759":"Stunningly awful!\n\nThat Merle and Willie would even consider this decent is beyond me. I suppose this was in the midst of the drugs they were into but that hardly excuses taking one of the finest American songs, P&L, and ruining it for generations!\n\nThey come off like robber barons finding poor ol' Townes gem and ripping it off by putting out a horrendous version of P&L! They manage to delete all the soul and feeling out of this song. Listen to ANY Townes version and you'll know exactly what I mean!\n\nThe fact Willie still speaks of it like a high point of sorts should act as a\" don't smoke pot kids\" warning!","9760":"Awesome song!","9761":"Perfect and no problems with my order! Even arrived sooner than expected. Thank you!!","9762":"The people singing this song do not sound like the moody blues....It left me wondering if it is a forgery and the preview is from the part of the song that sounds the best....definitely disappointed....","9763":"The whole set, I, II, III of Morning Evening Prayer is exceptional.  When my friends listen they all want to purchase.\nIt is very contemplative, calming, and I play it while driving because it keeps me focused and calm.","9764":"This song is what gospel music is all about.  When you hear this song, you want to close your eyes, clap your hands and definitely  meditate and glorify leaning on the Lord.  You will play this song whenever you need uplifting or even right before you go to church on Sunday morning.  If you don't go to church, well, this song just might get you up and out of the house.","9765":"this is very well written. now one of my favorites. a little bit of old and a little bit of new","9766":"I heard this song when I was about 10 years old by Pam Tillis. She redid this song from its original version and I could still remember it 22 years later. She did an amazing job and I was happily surprised to find it on Amazon. :)","9767":"Cute old-timey Halloween song with a nice beat. Has all the Halloween themes with ghosts, witches, brew, eerie midnight skies, caves, and more.","9768":"Fun, toe tapping and hard driving performance by a highly talented group.","9769":"One of the best U2 songs from their best lp imo Achtung Baby.","9770":"WAY too small for extra large size, total waste of money","9771":"Five Stars all the way! no joke. The beat alone is what sold me,classic old school Westcoast beats with a new school twist. The lyrics are the icing on this already sweet cake. I'm going to buy the Flac version on Cdbaby too. I wish Amazon had Cd quality flac file downloads too. Get some good headphones for this one,and a headphone amp,or pc with high quality sound card. This song alone is worth the album price,to me it is,because it's rare to find these Westcoast beats in rap these days,non generic beats.","9772":"Downloaded and when I went to play it, it stops half way through and starts over?....do not buy this version","9773":"It's U2 what can I say","9774":"Downloaded with ease.  I am not a U2 fan but I like this song.  You probably do too since you took the time to look it up.","9775":"Untuned ensembles, flubbed attacks, sour sustained pitch, uncentered passing tones and just plain wrong notes - this set has it all. Even the glockenspiel: ting tong thok clang. I can't count the number of times I winced and said \"oh god\" during the first four symphonies. The 5th and 6th are okay, and I mean just okay, as in 3 out of 5 Amazon stars. But the opening bars of the seventh symphony are emblematic of the whole: horn <oops>, winds <flinch>, trumpet <urp>, clarinets <O merciful lord>....\n\nThe tightly packed box is 3\/4 inches (2 cm) thick and contains paper envelopes with round plastic windows for each disc. The \"booklet\" is a folded leaf with track listings and running times, but nowhere is there any mention of the vocal soloists. A web search revealed a lot of names I didn't recognize plus Beverly Sills. Beverly Sills? Why is this label ignoring such a huge marketing asset?\n\nSteer far clear of this edition. It is eleven hours that you will never get back. Life is too short to listen to badly tuned Mahler.","9776":"Keep in mind, this set was recorded many years ago, but has been remastered.  The performance was recorded in the Mormon Tabernacle and the acoustics are great.  The Utah Symphony may not attain to the NY Philharmonic, but they are great to my ears.  Highly recommended.","9777":"I was hoping for something from Alice to bring in Halloween akin to his classics such as; Teenage Frankenstein, He's Back (the Man Behind the Mask), Dangerous Tonight, Cold Ethyl or Chop, Chop, Chop!  That was not to be with this song unfortunately.  While not horrible, it's DEFINITELY not on par with the aforementioned material.","9778":"daughter loved it","9779":"It was handy for someone with no accompanist.  It was different than another version I had before.  It could have had more help for the singer on the track","9780":"I know this quartet,they practiced for the Great Lakes Chamber Music Festival in our music room. They were very young Shouse Fellows. I listened with amazement to music sounding like that played by an eminent senior quartet. Since, they have received excellent reviews from respected critics. I enjoyed their interpretation of the Ligeti quartets ,they are quite difficult but were very well played. In a few weeks they will perform at the Detroit Chamber Music Society which gets many of the worlds best quartets. I look forward to more CDs from the Parkers","9781":"Full Force did it again. This is a great song. Loving the beat. It makes me dance every time I listen to it.","9782":"i don't what somes listeners have in mind but this oustanding record is a achievement! a lot of listenings are required to hear the beauty of the music from someone who choose to be not the next schredder but the next finder!\nSome let's say nice people(!) like mike Keanelly or Steve Vai can't go wrong, sorry for the reviewer who prefer his cat's improvisation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nbeautiful music with one idea per seconde!\nthanks mrResnicoff!\nFabrice from france","9783":"Proof that with some recording gear, ANYBODY can apparently call themselves a musician. I've heard similar compositions when my cat walks over my piano. But my cat plays with feeling.\n\nThere is so much aimless rambling, soulless guitar playing and no sense of direction with any of the ideas, it's kind of comical.\n\nIf you can imagine a version of Frank Zappa without any talent or songwriting ability, you can get an idea of what Mr. Resnicoff has in store for you. Sadly, he's no better a writer than a musician...","9784":"I do a radio show and play vinyl. I read the description for this record, which said  it was in great condition and it was being sold as a collector LP.  It was in fairly bad shape with scratches and warped. Not the best quality, especially to play on the air. Not happy with this one...","9785":"I bought both this song and \"untitled song\" from Date Tunes http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B003HB1Z1C\/ref=cm_cr_mts_prod_img -- they are the SAME song. Hope I prevent others from making the same mistake XD","9786":"Do Not Buy!  This is the second one of these I have purchased and it comes distorted, scratchy sounding, skipping, etc.  I bought it for my 90 year old father. The player he has is playing every other cd just fine.  He complained that this one was not working well.  I decided to just purchase another one and it is the same way!!!!\nAmazon, you need to pull this off and correct the problem. These are defective.

If you like Parov Stellar, you'll probably like this too.  Be advised: you probably won't get this tune out of your head quickly, but it's a better earworm than a lot of songs I could name.","9790":"I expected this cd to have different music for spinning to help keep me motivated.  Instead, it was VERY boring!!!  The CD consists of the same tune over and over and over. I didn't \"Ride the Wave,\" I almost fell asleep from boredom.","9791":"Was not what I thought it would be, especially for the money spent.  One 5 minute long instrumental song for over $8.00... not good in the fitness industry.","9792":"Couldn't figure it out, so haven't used it unfortunately, since it seemed really interesting, going back to the traditional CD or MP3","9793":"This album is absolutely awesome and good to hear, mostly. Nice album mix of songs, at this particular time it first was released.","9794":"If you love smooth jazz with a mix of Bossa Nova & Neo soul thrown in this cut is for you...\nGreat lyrics, mellow vocals, it's what quiet nights are made of.","9795":"I bought this expecting this to sound like a remix version of the original...The vocals sound awful!! The worst part is that the sample of the song has not enough singing featured to really get the full effect....awful","9796":"Heard this on a smooth jazz radio channel and had to have it. So, I found it here and downloaded the same day !","9797":"Vitamin string quartet is great, and this is no exception to the rule.","9798":"Admirable film music. Suggestion of late cool jazz and propelling strings with cold war stark indifference of piano, stabbing the quiet texture.","9799":"This is  A good song not really my type of music but I listen to it some times, I give it 2to4 stars","9800":"Sounds too whiny\/emo so that I could not get into it. The music is great, but the lyrics need work.","9801":"Great music","9802":"ANOINTED! CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE!","9803":"I was looking for background music in a busy office, and found these 3 rhythmic and ethereal music tracks.  Co-workers and fellow meditators have commented on how calming and spiritual this music is and it truly is creating a calm space for concentration or journeying.  Not the typical shamanic drumming, but nevertheless well-suited for the purpose.  Highly recommended.","9804":"The sounds in this kit were refreshing to listen to and relaxing. It was fantastic that I found this. Just sounds to listen to in the background","9805":"Amazing","9806":"This was just way to death metal for me.  But hey, it was free so I tried it.  For those of you who like death metal give it try.","9807":"Very explicit, with NOTHING to do with XMas. Misleading and really a dumb effort. Get some suggestive Bob Rivers instead...","9808":"Its shitty metal that they give out for free, stopping being so damn cheap and go spend some money and support good music","9809":"This guy is special.  His arrangements are traditional, soothing and true to the spirit of the songs.

Love all their other stuff though!","9814":"I would have loved to listen to this Symphony, that's why I purchased it. It downloaded fine but wouldn't play. Guess I wasted my money.

We will all miss him. RIP brother.","9816":"Calling this a \"cello\" album is disingenuous at best, outright fibbing at worst. That's clearly a synthesizer, and it's probably not a real piano either.  Skip it.

I like to listen to it whenever I'm mad at someone!","9821":"Great voice ,awesome song. Although he's resinging,his version is great. Has a great beat. I would recommend this song and I give it 5 Stars,too.","9822":"the Beirach \"Sunday Songs\" cd on the main page links directly to this \"Sunday Song\" mp3 download. however, they are two entirely different recordings. someone should fix that problem. and to be sure, my \"1 star\" rating has nothing to do w\/ the music. just the incorrect info. i have \"Sunday Songs\" and it a beautiful solo piano recording...","9823":"Really nice music.  Very New Age which is what I like.  However don't care for for the tracks with the sound of water running","9824":"Perfect. Sound quality is great.  Very easy to download and just what I wanted.  Great way to get demo and accompaniment tracks quickly.","9825":"A wonderful song. I love this song.","9826":"This made me want to take a nap, not go for a run! It was way too slow. I may update this review if I find a use for this music, but for running it's a no go.","9827":"Vuelvo a Ti- It's a spectacular songs for those who like romantic songs, and Manolo Otero. He was a unique singer, he broke frontiers with his great voice and songs. When he sings, he has so much passion on his voice. He reminds me of Perry Como, Julio Iglesias, or Jose Luis Rodriguez \"El PUMA\".","9828":"Ok I don't what has happened to Linkin Park over the years but they have gone real soft.  What happen to the hard  hitting songs from years ago?  When I started this song I thought it must be a tribute song for Linkin Park nope...it was them.","9829":"It.  All.  Good.  Little.  Joe.  is.  The. Best","9830":"There needs to be a higher quality encoding \/ remastering of this song.  The existing mp3 file has some serious artifacts embedded in it, though, admittedly, I didn't notice the problems until I was trying to create a mix for a wedding.","9831":"I have yet to buy the songs but just playing the samples of them I can tell im going to love it.  More I say More","9832":"What a great LIVE instrumental. Of course I'm a RUSH fan. Have been since the 70's. Going to include this song in my next video production.\n\nIt's so EZ getting songs from Amazon. I recommend it to all the older folks who have no clue what all those other music download places are or how they work.\n\nAmazon makes it E-Z.","9833":"This is ensemble playing at its best! Here is a wonderful presentation of piano trios by the great composers: Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn, and Shostokovich all passionately and artfully played. Genuine depth of feeling between the musicians translates into a genuine appreciation for the pieces. If you enjoy small ensemble playing, you must hear this!","9834":"I downloaded this piece by mistake. Was looking for another Satie popular piece.  I got goosed, but Satie is a genius and I'm sure this piece has its fans.","9835":"I think I wa half asleep when I ordered this and didn't really listen to the sample...no more late night ordering for me...I am cut off!","9836":"My fiancee and I purchased this thinking we were getting the original songs in a wedding album. To our horror, we discovered that it was instead a collection of possibly the worst covers known to mankind. I don't know how much they were charged for the rights to do these covers, but it was not nearly enough. I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this album if they could get the whole thing for 99 cents. Avoid this collection!","9837":"I just saw these guys in concert, love thier message especially this song. like the song says we should always be striving for peace.","9838":"I heard part of this song on IHeart radio and went on a search to find it. Loved the words and the melody. A refreshing blend of retro and modern brings a lovely twist to the holidays to be enjoyed by everyone. Enjoy!!","9839":"Beautiful!","9840":"Received the songs very quickly over Amazon cloud with no problems. However unfortunately the song titles at times did not match the actual songs. Furthermore there were duplicate songs in the CD collection. As background music this made things confusing at times.\nContacted Amazon regarding the errors in the collection. Within two days they replied with apologies and refunded me back my purchase price. I thought that was outstanding of them.","9841":"I wanted the speak to my heart which is on the essential album this was the wrong song and they don't let you see enough of the name or hear enough of the sample to determine. I was using my phone to try to order it.","9842":"It works very well.","9843":"This is the version with the verse \"I got nipples on my t*tties as big as my thumb, I got sumpin' 'tween my legs'll make a dead man come.\" It's been issued as \"Shave 'Em Dry (take 2)\".\n\nThis is a rip-off. Someone's pressing '45s from their CD collection again. They didn't even try to make this one look like anything other than a rip off.","9844":"Ive listened to many great albums, especially albums of this nature.  Only an idiot would classify this under any category! This is Genuine warm-hearted music.  Vocals that savor that peice of your soul that tells you, \"I've been there before\" stinging your every move throughout the day.  This is the kind of album that has something significant in every song that stands out from the others. The Rhythms are warm and have very strong direction.  No song on this album should go unheard.  I strongly recommend this album if you like The Starting Line, with The Early November kind of Rhythms, or if your just looking for a great album don't let this one go.  Like they say 90% of good music goes unheard, don't let this one be one of the 9\/10.  This album has won a place in my cd case.  Believe me thats an honor enough. Buy This Album!","9845":"Always looking for some good but beautiful music for the Fall season.  This song is particularly soothing and I enjoy listening to it.","9846":"Again I am pleased and very much enjoy the music from this album. I particularly enjoy this kind of music during the Fall season.","9847":"great","9848":"Don't waste your money this is 7 seconds of music for .89 . I gave it 1 star so I could get this in .","9849":"Great happy upbeat song! More people need to listen to his work! He is an extremely talented artist. Remember the name because he will one day be a household name.","9850":"My favorite vocalist.","9851":"This CD is amazing.  The range of different kinds of music that this group can toss out is just extraordinary.  Every piece is perfect, a mix of fascinating rhythms, haunting lyrical passages, energy and feeling.  The background music for Schindler's List and for Cinema Paradiso is unforgettable.  I got a disc, listened to it over and over (couldn't stop), then ordered a bunch to give as Christmas gifts.  I think my friends will love them.","9852":"Not the original recording","9853":"great group and very hard to find groups from this TV show - I ended up purchasing the whole season","9854":"I saw Pentatonix perform this song on \"The Sing-Off\" and I got chills watching them. Am so happy the won the competition. Their song arrangements are brilliant! And I don't care what the judges said, I LOVED their rendition of \"Your Love is My Drug.\" I think they could do a unique arrangement and sing the names in a telephone book and I'd buy it. Yeah, they're THAT good!!! Keep it up, Pentatonix. We all need more groups like you who remind us of what music is really all about: Beauty, being unique, translating emotions into wonderful sound, and having REAL TALENT!","9855":"I haven't bought music since ??, but I fell in love with Pentatonix when they aced Love Lockdown on The Sing-Off. The acapella harmonies and rhythms on this Kanye West number are complex, inventive and exciting. Buy the collection PTX Volume 1 as well (incredible!) and also their cover of Dog Days Are Over, and get ready to obsess.","9856":"Why is he talking for so long and not singing?? Waste of money!","9857":"...more so in remembering and enjoying Christmas. His style and twist on songs livens them up and more celebratory!!\nGreat collection addition for anyone!! Normal that is...\n\nThank you...\"Merry Christmas\"","9858":"True worship! You will enter into God's presence......","9859":"Awesome","9860":"This comes across as a mocking joke. Like some sort of bad comedy sketch and the joke really isn't funny. The music is simple and sounds like something you could whip up with the simplest of musical programs. The album title In Metal would have been more aptly names In Crap. Giving this one start was too many for the abysmal atrocity this thing is.","9861":"Love this CD, beautiful....soulful music. I have also heard Kara in person and she has a beautiful spirit that comes out through her music, you can tell she loves what she does! Her songs all tell wonderful stories!","9862":"Brilliant & beautiful compositions. Uplifting& fun to listen to. Been playing this CD over & over!!","9863":"I love this song. Since first hearing it (live in Seattle in Aug 2013), it has stuck. The Silent Comedy is great, even better live.","9864":"I did not realize how different some of these could be.  It's an ok version of it but not nearly as good as the one by oral Roberts university. Wish I'd listened to both before I made the mistake of purchasing this one","9865":"don't like rap music.","9866":"very soothing!","9867":"I find it a distraction as the music is very plain in tone and does not sound like the live  Gregorian CHANT that I have heard..","9868":"There are two multi-movement works by Philip Glass and one by Michael Nyman on the new album released by the Sonic Art Saxophone Quartet. Taken as complete wholes, none of the three is outstanding, though there are individual movements within them that are very powerful.\n\nThe \"Mishima\" quartet is actually an adaptation for saxophones of a work Glass originally wrote for strings, part of the soundtrack for the movie Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters. Many critics, myself included, often excoriate Glass for the lack of harmonic development in his pieces. Here, however, his stylistic signature does not severely detract from the pieces' sense of forward motion; each idea is repeated, true, but not so many times as to become tiresome. They all share a tone of brooding mixed with quiet menace that is quite striking. It helps that they are short pieces; none of the six movements is longer than three and a half minutes, and the second and fourth are barely more than a minute each.\n\nI've been listening to the string version of \"Mishima\" for comparison, and I think it actually comes off slightly better on the saxophones. The constant eighth-note pulses that are so characteristic of Glass seem somehow more live played on winds, as do the ascending arpeggios. The performers do an excellent job of giving different emphases to each note in a phrase, making the smallest variation truly stand out. The string version, by contrast, has a certain homogeneity that renders the pieces more emotionally distant.\n\nThe next work, also by Glass, is simply entitled \"Saxophone Quartet,\" and it is a somewhat strangely organized four-movement piece. The first movement is sad and minor. The main melody carried on the soprano sax is lyrical enough, but the accompaniment is generally uninspired. As a longer work, around five and a half minutes, it does suffer from a bit of that Glassian repetitiveness, as certain segments are heard several times without adding anything to the musical or emotional impact on the listener. The second movement is considerably more energetic and daring (part of the reason why the overall organization of the movements is confusing); it evokes imagery of scaling a great but precarious height, the excitement and tension building and building until a final explosion of melodic energy sends it all tumbling down. The ensemble works together more effectively here; rather than one instrument having the melody while the others play repeating patterns, there is a great deal of trading back and forth, and phrases of powerful homophony as well, particularly towards the end. Unfortunately, the third movement is both the longest and the dullest. It has neither the excitement of the second nor the lyricism of the first. Glass also returns to a much more straightforward arranging technique for much of the movement, with each of the players getting their turn having the primary melody, while the others play the same old interlocking pulse pattern. There is a new melodic idea introduced briefly about three-quarters of the way through, but then it disappointingly leads to nothing more than one more time through the main theme.\n\nLuckily, the fourth movement makes up for the flaws in the rest of the longer work, and then some. It is amazing, probably my single favorite piece by Glass. The stuttering, syncopated rhythmic motive is inseparable from the driving melodic line, that here undergoes actual transformation and development as the piece goes on. The melodic statements are interspersed with swirling loops and turns in a new register and instrument, and these transitions are organic, vital, and varied. Because this movement has some actual structure and meaningful form to it, the restatement of the main theme, when it occurs, feels like an actual arrival, not simply another repetition. The climax features some striking dynamic changes, with sudden quiet moments that are in turn overwhelmed by storms of very fast runs on the bari sax, all leading to a strong and explosive conclusion that hits like a ton of bricks. Why can't Glass write more pieces that are this well put together?\n\nMichael Nyman's collection \"Songs for Tony,\" also a four-movement work, begins very promisingly. In the first movement, Nyman sets up a powerful, swift-moving minor mode riff that juxtaposes the high and low registers of the ensemble. The energy of the original hook never relents, but the melody that emerges and is carried primarily by the tenor sax is surprisingly sensitive and touching. The warm, Renaissance-like concluding cadence is a nice touch as well.\n\nThe other three movements, regrettably, never attain the same vitality as the first. They tread by-now familiar sax quartet territory, with melodies and harmonies that are at best clichd and at worst simply plodding. The third movement's main theme is memorable, even catchy, but the transformations it undergoes are unconvincing and ultimately not very, well, transformative. While in the fourth movement, Nyman aims for real subtlety with an extremely quiet main melody in the bari sax, that is only lightly accompanied. The patience required to wait while the piece slowly builds is not rewarded by anything particularly revelatory, however, only more of the same, with an inconclusive, anemic ending that feels more like someone simply shut off the mikes in the studio, rather than a real conclusion.\n\nSpeaking of microphones and studios... as someone whose main training is in composition, most of my thinking when I hear a new album goes towards the architecture of the pieces and the like, but of course there are purely production-oriented considerations to take into account as well. The truth is, while the album's performances didn't detract from my enjoyment of the pieces, neither did they enhance it. Although both the playing and the engineering are smooth and competent, with even very subtle key-clicks and the like rendered expertly and audibly, there is a slight lack of crispness to some of the articulations that make already slow pieces bog down a bit. The exception, as noted above, is the rendering of the beautiful main melody of the first movement of \"Songs For Tony.\" Which brings me back around full circle, and leads me to conclude that the performances were really dictated by the strengths and weaknesses of the compositions--but that could just be my personal bias.\n\nThe Sonic Art Quartet's album is, overall, pleasant but uneven. The second and third works presented have beautiful moments, but in most of the cases there is too much dead air between them to allow the music as a whole to come alive. For fans of the original version of the \"Mishima\" quartet, the reworking for saxophones is worth hearing, and the strongest movements of each of the two other offerings deserve to be entered into the canon of literature for the sax quartet. But there is a great deal of skippable material here as well, and all but the most completionist of listeners will want to acquire individual tracks rather than the whole thing.\n\n-\n\nMatt Weber is a New York based composer, educator, and political slacktivist.\n\nOriginally published on ICareIfYouListen.com","9869":"Fans of modern music looking for something new should give a listen to the Sonic Art Saxophone Quartet, which sounds like nothing else on the alt-classical landscape. The four members of this tight little outfit conjure an amazing range of tonalities and timbres, far beyond what one might consider possible on the saxophone. The unusual instrumentation proves particularly apt for adventurous composers like Philip Glass and Michael Nyman, who are featured on this disc. The group's powerful yet supple sound perfectly evokes Nyman's poignant lyricism and the nervous intensity of Glass' passive-aggressive sonic structures. Intricate, beautiful and hypnotic, this music will take the listener on unexpected and joyous journeys.","9870":"There's about 2 cadences I would listen to twice. The rest suck. And if you are looking at this for running, there's so many tracks that talk on and on before the cadence kicks in. Very distracting","9871":"Clyde Gilmour's show was wonderful because you never knew what you were going to hear next.  He might start with Mozart, followed by an operatic piece and then a track from a spoken word recording.  After that you could locomotive sounds, jazz, or maybe a comedy piece.  There was always insightful commentary as well.  I'll always recall hearing all or part of his weekly show when we would return from Church.  There are few if any shows like this today.  We now have programs and even entire channels devoted to very specific genres.  But Gilmour's Albums did not exist in the era of hundreds of channels or the Internet.  You had far fewer choices then, so variety shows were very practical.  This CD captures some of the hosts favourite pieces along with his own words.  Theme music from the show is included.","9872":"The Epic Score series succeeds in painting a great mood for story telling. I use them as background music when I write, paint, or play DND with family and friends. I have many of them, and they are amazing.","9873":"Dear Amazon:\n\nI want a CD version of this album for the following reasons:\n\n1. BIGGEST REASON: When I download the mp3 version to my PC I make a backup using a blank CD. However when I do this and move it to another PC or other device all the tracks show up as track 1, track 2 etc. So I have to go and label all the tracks so I know which one is which. Worst of all there is no picture of the album when I put it into Windows Media player. Yes I actually care that the picture is not there. I know Windows Media player can try and find the picture online but it almost always doesn't find the right one. This is why I want the CD version so bad.\n\n2. When I rip a CD to my computer i want to be able to choose the format it gets ripped in.(mp3, wma, FLAC and so on).\n3. CD has better audio quality than the mp3 version\n4. I have to install software from amazon that is solely used for downloading the music and I don't like that.\n5. If there was a CD version I would have bought this already.\n\nSo please, do whatever you got to do to get me a CD version of this available on your website. please do it and I will most definitely buy it. I prefer all my music to come from it's purest source. the CD. I don't care if it costs a bit more I'm totally fine with that. If you can't do this than please tell me where I can get the CD version. (If there is one)If there isn't then have whoever makes this make CD versions.","9874":"Outstanding","9875":"glad to have found it","9876":"A haunting piece that strikes at the inner core of humanity.","9877":"Excellent!","9878":"Great song I discovered on my local radio station. Good, steady beat with a great message that remind you that with Him, there is a way~","9879":"This song, \"There is a Way\" is addictive!  It is such an original melody, great voices, and so inspiring!  Caught it on the Christian radio station on Comcast in the last year and can't hear it enough.  It's so not the same old-same old.","9880":"This recording was a disappointment. Telemann's music demands more than timid scraping and blowing.  I do not see the faults displayed here as endemic to HIP style performances, though they are common: a generally bloodless and etiolated style of playing, with absence of attack, limited dynamic range, an absence of any discernible commitment to or involvement with what is being played.  It's like viewing a landscape through a shower curtain or sitting through a sight-reading exercise. NOT recommended","9881":"Super cool music","9882":"Julie Roberts, created an album that brings back memories, and enjoyment, of my best-loved Holiday. The album  has an excellent velocity, for the celebration. You will enjoy her personality in this wonderful collection, of Christmas songs.","9883":"Love this band!  Lots of soul which I find is lacking in most of Christian music to day. Buy it now.","9884":"At a recent perfomance in Vegas, Brian said \"...this next song is a long one\" they started the song the audience went crazy and my only critique was that they didn't make it longer.","9885":"Great Product!!","9886":"Very disappointed.  This is not the original song, which the cover picture and description lead one to believe it was. This was a flat, uninteresting rendition.  Watch out for cheap knock offs.","9887":"Though the album is fine, the album rear cover is not the original. The original had a write-up review about Redd Foxx written by my late father. I finally found one on another website that is original....and it was less expensive.","9888":"Anointed powerful song! Love it.","9889":"somehow it just apera on my account , i dint order this :(","9890":"Not anywhere near what Vangelis is capable of. It is kind of bland and does not go anywhere. It would be nice if he could write some new music that was as good as he wrote back in the late 70's through the 80's. Most new albums are just recompilations of other good songs he wrote before. This one is new to me, but not to great. I hope he'll get the spark back that he had before.","9891":"Dirty Nasty pounds the s*#@!  Thank the lord all mighty!  Hip Hop is not dead!  Oh yeah!  Dirty Nasty in bring'n the good vibe!","9892":"I wasn't expecting Dirt Nasty's next CD would be so bad, all but one of the songs aren't written by Dirt Nasty.","9893":"I truly enjoy enjoy electronic music of vanesa Conde. i truly recomend to buy An endless night by Vanessa conde on the amazon store and itunes.","9894":"I'm a fan of Reich, but I never liked the Triple Concerto and found Different Trains to be a bit taxing, though the first part of its three has held my interest over the years.  Here, the Triple Quartet sounds harsh.  Now, harshness is a quality that might actually be a great addition to Different Trains considering the subject matter.  In this particular instance, that harshness continues but somehow the sound lacks depth.  I don't hear the trains in the music as I do on the version from the Different Trains\/Electric Counterpoint album.  Maybe I'm just partial to the versions I heard originally and new ones just don't compare.\n\nIn any case, the whole point of my review is the stunning Piano Counterpoint.  This piece is new to me and this might be the only place where it's been recorded.  Vincent Corver's arrangement brings tremendous life to Reich's style.  It's as if he really \"gets\" Reich.  Dare I say he might have even improved on it?  This is a lively, happy, well-played and enjoyable piece and out of character with the rest of the music on this album.  Because you can buy each track individually, I opted to buy just this one and I'm very happy to hear it bouncing off my walls.  If you're a Reich fan, don't miss this stunning track.  2 stars for the album, 5 stars for Piano Counterpoint.","9895":"Bought it for Halloween","9896":"GLMET is a all female Japanese melodic death metal band, I've also seen they like to say they are \"Moe\" (probably spelt wrong) for cute death metal. But they are a pretty awesome band, but are Independent so getting their stuff could be hard but worth while to buy.\n\nThis single you get three songs AND a music video for Rebirth! But the music video isn't on a separate disc, its in the regular cd, and if you want to put it on IPhones, tablets etc. you can just open up the CD on your computer and drag and drop the file to desktop. But it wouldn't work for my windows media player, but it works on quicktime.\n1) Rebirth\n2) Last Words\n3) While There's Life\n\nOverall I enjoyed this CD very well, so if you're new to GLMET like I am you'll like this single for a starter point.","9897":"The collection of of music is just mesmerizing. Shantala's rendition of these priceless hymns is simply heavenly. So peaceful and and soothing it just touches your heart. Perfect for meditation, prayer, or just relaxation.\n\nTheir version of the Hanuman Chalisa sung with such love and tenderness brought me to tears.","9898":"Love it!  Perfect for relaxation, meditation, yoga, or just anytime. First heard it when I went to yoga at The Shop in Park City.  I went home and ordered it right away.","9899":"Love this music and love this song. If you like heavy bass and electronic sound, you'll like this. As always, excellent quality from Amazon.","9900":"If you're old enough to remember the TV show, this short tune will warm your heart. Excellent sound quality.","9901":"Same as the previous reviewer... This has been my all time favorite folk album since I was a child. I've been looking for this on CD or MP3 for years!

I found a webpage that gives an update on the two women:  http:\/\/pennyandjean.net\/Welcome.html  Sadly it tells us that Penny had a stroke at only age 19 which ended their singing career together. Thankfully they left us with this wonderful album. Still in my heart.","9902":"This is ine of my very favorite folk albums.  The girls sing so well--and I enjoy singing along with them.","9903":"It's alright just not my favorite version","9904":"Great singer and song.","9905":"This song sounds really like the blues.

Instead it appears to be a rag-bag of tracks drawn principally from two albums:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Flamenco-Fantasy\/dp\/B001O0HZDK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Flamenco Fantasy<\/a>&nbsp;(1960) and the double-album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Sabicas-in-Concert\/dp\/B0013KSL3E\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sabicas in Concert<\/a>&nbsp;(1972)\n\nAs to Vol. 2, \"Alambra\" should be \"Alhambra\" (the Moorish palace in Granada).  El Pillallo (or Piyayo, 1864-1940) was a well-known and popular singer\/guitarist from Mlaga.  The occurrence of two pieces with the same title but different styles seems to be an oversight on Sabicas's part, as his titles were usually unique.\n\nIt's nearly all good stuff, if you don't mind the albums being garbled together.  Since Amazon doesn't list the flamenco styles of the tracks, I do so below:\n\n01. Rondea Llanto Minero\n02. Tarantas Llanto Minero\n03. Buleras\n04. Buleras II\n05. Granadinas Patio de Los Leones\n06. Rondea Sentimiento\n07. Malaguea Homenaje a Mlaga\n08. Granadinas Joyas de la Alhambra\n09. Malagueas El Pillallo\n10. Soleares\n11. Alegras Puerto Santa Mara\n\nThe total time is 44'22\".\n\nI don't understand why they didn't just reissue the original LPs.  I suppose I must be stupid.","9908":"This is one of those cds you'll either like or you wont. I love Creature Feature's sound. A Gory Demise is the best song on the disk.","9909":"Never could get it to download.","9910":"I LOVE Glen Templeton's music!  He's an amazing performer and singer.  I've been to see him perform in Nashville many times and always enjoy the show.  Can't wait to hear new music in the future.  CB4L!","9911":"I really liked this. It was an excellent purchase experience.","9912":"As soon as I played my downloaded file, I could hear the loud 'hiss' on it and it lasts all throughout the song!  I might as well be downloading illegally in some forum somewhere and get a better quality audio file!","9913":"I purchased this thinking it was a full CD but it only had one song.  If you download it, you pay 99 cents.","9914":"I down loaded this track thinking it was Jo jo. it is not Jo jo. and I paid for it\n=(","9915":"This was terrible,and was not what I ordered this is a completely different song and now have wasted my time and my money searching for this song. I would not give this song even a half star. I rather have my money back then listen to this trash.","9916":"Really enjoy listening to this EP. The songwriting and production makes it one of my favorites, with \"Leaving Me\" being the standout. Looking forward to their next release.","9917":"good","9918":"Say Hey Gang,\nFor all of you Johnny Rivers fans out there, JR is back!! On July 4, 1964, Mr. Rivers claimed the #2 spot on Cashbox's Top 100 Hit Parade with Memphis. It's November 2010...some 46 years later and JR is still delivering music with the voice that is still as strong and powerful as it was on all of those hits from yesteryear. Grab the mouse, click on the download button, and let Mr. Rivers show you how it's done. New Home is a great tune...let's hope it gets some radio airplay...which it deserves!!","9919":"I cannot review this product because I can't download it or listen to it ,because amazon has changed their apps and they do not work with my phone,tablet,or laptop although they worked fine taking my order and money.come on amazon come up with a workable app.","9920":"One of the true unsung artist of his era. This is his second album as leader and is on the renown Blue Note Label. Trying to find this on vinyl is all but impossible. But thankfully Blue Note finally found the lost tapes and reissued this on vinyl sometime back.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1  Good Old Soul\n2  Up Tight's Creek\n3  Theme For Doris\n4  True Blue\n5  Miss Hazel\n6  Nothing Ever Changes My Love For You\n\nThe Sextet:\n\nTina Brooks - Tenor Sax\nFreddie Hubbard - Trumpet\nDuke Jordan - Piano\nSam Jones - Bass\nArt Taylor - Drums\n\nRecorded 1960 on the Blue Note Label. This reissue carries catalog number 4041.\n\nReview:\n\nAs with Minor Move and Back to the Tracks, Tina Brooks' True Blue is an album of hard bop excellence. Recorded in '60, it finds the tenor saxophonist accompanied by Freddie Hubbard on trumpet (a week after Brooks helped Hubbard on his debut album, Open Sesame), Duke Jordan on piano, Sam Jones on bass, and Art Taylor on drums. The six original compositions by Brooks are well-crafted, though none are stellar. The group's cohesive sound, its consistent blues-induced jazz groove, and the numerous well-defined solos are the album's strengths.\n\nYou'd never know it from listening to his distinctive tone and melodic attitude, but Brooks never made it big. Though he recorded four albums for Blue Note, True Blue was the only one that was released during his lifetime. I'll health and drugs eventually took their toll and he passed away in '74 at 42 years of age.\n\nThere is a terrifically pensive blues cry in every Brooks solo on this release that is mesmerizing. While he's often shadowed by trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, the two gracefully bring out some profoundly thoughtful improvising from each other. None of the five tunes (and two alternative takes) are exactly inspiring tunes. But Brooks packs a lot of raw emotionality and innovative musical craft into his solos. Although the liner notes makes much of the Sonny Rollins influence, I actually hear a lot more of a tone I'd connect to Booker Erwin, Ornette Coleman, or Brooks' companion in the Blue Note recording studio, Jackie McLean. Anyone who enjoyed the dramatic support Brooks gave McLean on Jackie's Bag should treasure this, the only album Brooks released under his name as leader during his lifetime. Brooks sounds like a desperately driven musician wanting something beyond the bop of 1960 and never quite making the breakthrough to freedom that McLean found through his association with Ornette Coleman. The rhythm section of drummer Art Taylor, bassist Sam Jones, and pianist Duke Jordan simply never push him that hard to explore new musical territory. I wonder who Brooks would have become had he worked with a drummer like Eddie Blackwell or Elvin Jones.\n\nWhat True Blue gives generously is a full blooded musical portrait of a hard-working and distinctive sounding tenor man with a blue cry stuck in his throat and heart. It is an achievement to treasure.\n\nEnd Review:\n\nI could not agree more with the above two reviews. If you do not have Tina Brooks in your jazz library, you have missed on of the all time greats. While Tina Brooks does not have a large body of work and he ceased recording in 1961, \"True Blue\" remains on of those tour de force recordings to be treasured forever.\n\nView the pics and decide for yourself. This belongs in any jazz library of substance.","9921":"As a child of the 80's I always have a soft spot for Cyndi Lauper.\nBut this song just doesn't do it. It doesn't represent her music well, and it doesn't represent Christmas music well. I don't see myself ever listening to the song again unless it comes up randomly in a shuffle.","9922":"I must have been living in a cave - this is amazing music with a positive message in each song.","9923":"great music","9924":"This is a beautiful selection.  I have listened to it many time , and would recommend the song highly.","9925":"This album does nothing for me. I will stick with SOULFIRE and BURNING SOUL.  Outstanding music by \"the Flames\".","9926":"Great!","9927":"reminds me of yesteryear thanks for having it available","9928":"I played the track before I added it to my cloud player and my wife thought that I had found a Patcy Cline track. Thank you for the great track Ms. lauper.","9929":"My friend told me these guys are going to be playing a set with their band, so I checked them out... picked up this album today and already listened at least three times. Really good song writing, my favorite is track 1 but the whole album is worth a listen; and I can already tell its going to be a fun show!","9930":"I never bought this !!!!!!!","9931":"I just don't like her voice.","9932":"This song absolutely rocks!  I knew nothing about the band, but needed a song with \"Lightning\" in the title (don't ask) when I bought it.  Now, it's in the top ten most played songs in my phone!","9933":"I was looking for music which highlighted the cello.  This rendition of Silent Night is a great arrangement for cello duet.  Nicely done.","9934":"A sour grapes song of probably unrequited love. I know the feeling well. But never mind, he'll come back for more like Punch (and Judy).","9935":"The song wouldn't play on my devices..","9936":"Relaxing and beautiful","9937":"well done","9938":"Very nice song. If you like this type of musing.  Has a nice rhythm.","9939":"excellent! I feel thsi song is way under rated, great at both  the club and the gym, always ready to go in my MP3 Player","9940":"I remember when I bought this cassette (I know, I know...what is a cassette) after seeing the band a small bar in Redondo Beach. Everyone was drinking (including me), but I kept looking over at the band thinking, damn, these guys are pretty good. Anyway, I wore out this cassette in my walkman while I rode my bicycle up and down the So Cal coastal cities of Torrance, Redondo, Hermosa, El Segundo, etc. It is a great combo of songs that will sink into your heart & soul. Many years have gone by, and I am re-discovering Andy & his musical friends, Renee Safier and Hard Rain. I am going to their Dylanfest concert on Sat, May 19th, 2012. Any ideas on how do you get an autograph on an MP3?","9941":"Got screwed on this....the there is no song.","9942":"SKaynan's EP is a lush, cosmic, bittersweet epic of electronic mood and sound. While mostly being \"chillout ambient\", there are added elements of lounge and breakbeat amongst other things. The album showcases Kaynan's musical sophistication and amazing feel for melody without gimmickry.","9943":"I have a collection of Glee tracks & while they top my list of things I don't want to get caught listening to at work, there's a lot of good stuff that's been on the show. That is, outside the wasteland that was most of season 3 spent in a black hole of uninspired Broadway selections. In this case, there are a couple decent vocal performances to this track, but I find that I listen to the first minute and a half of this until Rachael comes in.","9944":"Skye Sweetnam needs to find herself and this band isn't it.... I'll be waitin' for ya Skye !  ...Keep on Rockin' girl!","9945":"great","9946":"Love this song and album.  I had the great pleasure to see him perform this live.  He is such a gracious performer, he came up to us after his show before he left the stage and hugged our son,who is severely handicapped and wheelchair bound, and then he hugged each of us.  He made us feel like he knew about our pain and struggles with the blessed cross that we live with every day. Truly felt like he was singing this song to us.","9947":"We really liked the song and used it for a funeral.  It is more of a gospel song rather than a country song.  It has a beautiful piano accompaniment to it.","9948":"takes my breath away..so beautiful!","9949":"There are several versions of this song out by different artists, but I like this one best.  It's got a more raw, roots feel to it, like I'm hearing it in an old wooden church out in the woods.  Great uplifting song for someone who is going through troubled times, or just to remind you how good your life really is.","9950":"I saw Marti live and loved her music and voice. I purchased this album hoping for more of that same sound. The songs start off nice but then she inserts loud electronic segments that jolt you out of the beauty of the meditative sounds. Totally ruins the songs. Too bad because she was really good live without all the loud electronic noise.","9951":"I bought this as somebody had recommended it.  Unfortunately I didn't get to listen first.  The musicians are obviously very talented, but unless you are into non-stop fast trance like noisy beat music, you won't like it.  No disrespect meant to those that do, just try and listen before you buy. I rarely make these mistakes.","9952":"Beautiful voices blended together!","9953":"A great list of songs.  The Praise & Harmony series never disappoints.","9954":"Cami is not known by many; but, she is an excellent singer and teacher - too bad she left the Cactus Theatre in Lubbock and is no longer the coach\/mentor of the group of gals formerly known as the Cactus Cuties...","9955":"It wasn't the CD I thought it was and I really dislike the first 3 tracks with the totally (I think) inappropriate heavy bass line. Yuk. The rest of the tracks are better.","9956":"Dad used to wake me up to his version of Reveille. After sampling numerous renditions of this, I believe I found the perfect one.\nWARNING!!! - Do not make my error; I had this downloaded as an alarm on my Kindle Fire HD, which subsequently activated while I was 'taking care' of business in the mens' restroom at work.","9957":"I was very excited for this purchase because I teach children. However, when I tried to play the music the songs skipped.","9958":"I bought this to play at an elementary school.  I wasn't familiar with a lot of the songs, but I thought they would be appropriate for children since this was supposed to be for kids.  Even though the \"popular\" songs aren't by the original artists, they also haven't been edited and some have inappropriate or questionable lyrics.  I ended up only able to use about half of what I planned to use.","9959":"A+","9960":"I love the music of Tyree Glenn, however, this digital album is distorted and horrible to listen too. Buy the CD version of this album if you can, but the digital version is beyond disgrace!","9961":"I enjoy all the songs I purchase from Amazon for my Kindle.  The qualitiy of these songs are wonderful.","9962":"Every time I buy a download from Amazon, I can't seem to get it to download to my computer or to my Windows Media player or MP3.  I probably am doing something wrong but wish there was an easier process","9963":"This compilation offers a broad variety of flamenco songs sung by various artists.  If you want stirring flamenco music this work is not for you, but, historically and for 'Cante' lovers, you'll get your fill.","9964":"As Christmas approached, I was preparing my iPad for travel with Christmas music.\nThe Mormon Tabernacle Choir is the absolute gold standard for anything involving vocals! How could I choose any other for my Christmas music? Answer to question is, I could only choose the gold standard!","9965":"McCombs' `The Same Thing' is an interesting track.  There are moments, especially towards the chorus breakdown where it sounds like a stolen beat from a 70's sitcom.  There are moments when the vocals reach a fluidity that causes the words to meld together to the point where it doesn't sound like English anymore.  The base musicality has a bouncy folksiness to it that resembles a down-tuned Mumford and Sons.  The lead vocal is slightly too monotone to illicit a direct response from the eardrums, but then again as he speaks in tongues and rips off a whistle for a beat he resembles a smoothness reminiscent of famed hair bands of the 80's.  The overall sound is extremely dated though.  At the end of the day, `The Same Thing' feels too uneven for its own good, and it certainly outstays its welcome by stretching itself over six minutes in length.  Still, there is something interesting at play here.\n\nI don't really like this, but I'm intrigued enough to listen to more.","9966":"thanks.","9967":"Every once in a  while you come across a song that really touches your heart and stays with you for a long time. \"Wait for Me\" is worth being a part of your favorite all time music. It really has all of the best elements to make a perfect listening experience. I listen to a lot of new music and when I heard this song I was certain I had to buy it.","9968":"There's nothing I like to hear more than well put-together records now-a-days and this one is just that....pieced well together! The lyrics ring true to the theme 'unity and division' and the music takes you on journey winding up and down the spectrum. Definitely their best to date and a great recording at that! Keep it coming !!!!","9969":"Love this song","9970":"I bought this app and paid 2.99. It is a good app but it only work for 1 month. I tried to contact the support but they don't respond. Save your money and don't buy this app. They will just take your money and run. It's a bad business. Let it be a warning to all who wish to buy this app.","9971":"It's a good version of Bach Air G String but not the best.\nI've heard different versions on youtube before and this one is just so so.\nSo, I won't recommend people to buy this version, unless you can't find any better, and you really want to hear Bach Air G String","9972":"I have always been a fan of this group.  So glad to hear this version of Thinking of You.","9973":"Eric Roberson's song \"At The Same Time\" is the definition of dreamy. It has nice vocals, production and the lyrics are relatable to anyone who is loving someone that just isn't loving them. I've actually never heard the song before today but it's one of those tracks that you probably wouldn't want to skip over on your iPod if it came on.\n\nNice job, Eric.\n\n4.2 stars.","9974":"Excellent selection of music of the period.\n\nthe period","9975":"I loooove Eric Roberson, his music has that vibe that makes me feel so good.  I have no idea how he puts that feel good up in his music but he does a good job at it.  He is the boogey and the jam!!!!!","9976":"Something is wrong with the file that Amazon sends out, so you won't get the whole monolog.  Look for it some other way.","9977":"This album would be good if not thew vocal mix,what is so back in the mix that it is washed away by the music. You simply can not enjoy the singing. I have no idea why they mix this way some of the albums in this genre. Any other music style they do not mix like this. It is totally stupid and very frustrating.","9978":"Not a folk-style entry, as I expected.  More of an Eastern European \"blues\".","9979":"The perfect relaxing music. Great for music to sleep with. Beautiful music with the ocean sounds, which is not always the case.","9980":"Love this album! Love the message he brings.  Great artist and man of God","9981":"NEVER  GOT THE SONG","9982":"I love this song, it's always been one of my favorites. I'm thankful Amazon had it for purchase! Thanks Amazon!","9983":"Alfie Boe's voice gives me goosebumps.  His version is a must have for any Christmas music collection. .. you don't have to be an Alfie Boe fan to appreciate it.","9984":"Walipuna, got it on with Kamehameha Triology, Thanks, Mr. Kema","9985":"While the album selections are enjoyable, the pianist is heavy handed and mechanical, lacking sensitivity and emotion. Fur Elise would be a good example. The performances seems flat. And The Gate at Kiev, which offers  an opportunity to pound the keyboard, lacks timing and coloration.","9986":"I am Very Disappointed.  What I assumed I was getting was the whole 7 disc box set that comes in 3 fold up parts, and only ended up getting ONE of the 3, which contains 3 of the 7 discs.  There was no description to Describe that it was only an incomplete part of the whole box set, and only 1 picture!!  So very disappointed!!\n\nThe only plus is that it's Pearl Jam, and it is extremely hard to go wrong with Pearl Jam.\n\nBut now I have to shell out even more, in order to get the Whole Box Set, which I will now have a redundant 1\/3 of it.","9987":"The songs are great and dancing to them is the reason I bought them.  Went to see Chubby perform 2 days later and he put on a great show, he looked better than this album cover.","9988":"Not actually sung by John Berry. False advertising.","9989":"Very boring.  More New Age rather than electronica or chill. I feel cheated on this one.","9990":"I really like Fahrenheit even though they disbanded quite some time ago. These songs are great.","9991":"catchy song that will having you dancing and doing samba! the lyrics seem simple but the sounds and vocals are fun. super upbeat.","9992":"It won't play on my CD player because it is MP3","9993":"Need this for a Memorial day flag raising ceremony since I don't have a bugle or bugler. It's a very nice traditional version of Taps.","9994":"didn't like it","9995":"I like Eydie with the Trio Los panchos and have a \"complete\" collection of them together and  the Trio separately. But what a weird selection she has put together on I FEEL SO SPANISH! Not only were the songs poorly chosen, she also finds herself quite lost in her treatment of each.
