It's evident that the file they have is just plain corrupt. I've requested a refund, but have heard nothing back. Don't buy this CD!

7,"""Rainbow"" was a hard album for me to review. I love Johnny Cash, and to give anything that he has done less than 4 stars is tough for me. ""Rainbow"" was released in 1985 and was Cash's last album for Columbia. Veteran Memphis producer Chips Moman was given the honors this time around. Chips Moman had produced some incredible R&B hits, as well as bringing Willie Nelson to the masses with ""Always on my Mind."" However, this pairing doesn't work as well.  The material is weak and some quite ill-suited for Cash. ""Easy Street"" sounds contrived as Johnny Cash tries to relate to being a millionaire who's having a bad day. PLEEEEZ. On ""Love Me Like You Used To"" Cash sounds as bored singing it as I did listening to it. Sad. The album has three real good moments though. The opener ""I'm Leaving Now"" is a great lead track that Cash wrote about ""The System"" not a woman. Cut two is Kris Kristofferson's ""Here Comes That Rainbow Again"" which is an uplifting story told well. Cash's cover of CCR's ""Have You Ever Seen the Rain"" stands out also. This was the last digital download I needed to complete my collection. Now you know why.",0,1.0
8,"This was the very last original album from Johnny Cash to be released on Columbia records, after you listen to it you'll see why. A few good gems are on this, like his version of the CCR classic ""Have you ever seen the rain?"" but all in all this album is just lame. BUT I will say this......he then signed to Mercury records and made 5....yes 5 totally awesome CDs!  Buy all 5 of those merucry releases......1. Johnny cash is coming to Town....2. Water from the Wells of Home....3. Classic Cash '88 (re-recordings of his big hits)....4. Boom-chicka-Boom.....5. The Mystery of Life.",0,1.0
9,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Battlefield rendition of the series' many games' different themes. Battlefield 2 and Bad Company being the most prominent, the sequences are very well integrated and recording quality is amazing.

The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the very long, and very odd section of percussion only, about halfway through the song. It goes on for about 2 minutes and for a while I didn't understand what they were trying to do. I then figured that it was probably their attempt at the Battlefield 3 and 4 theme. But no, it's not. The album came out even before Bad Company 2 did... It doesn't ruin the overall experience entirely, but it was something that bothered me that I thought was worth noting. Otherwise, it's a great piece!",1,0.0

26,"If you love Jo Dee Messina- buy this cd.  Simply for the fact that it's new music from her and she is a fantastic singer and artist.  As a stand alone cd, it's not bad.  Probably the weakest of the ""Unmistakable"" trilogy in my opinion, but still with some good points.  ""Heaven was Needing a Hero"" and ""Get up Again"" are both great songs, with ""Get Up Again"" a throwback to an ""I'm Alright"" life is good anthem song. ""I like Me"" has promise but it's a bit all over the place.  ""How do you get High"" isn't as scandalous as it sounds, in fact, it really doesn't say anything as a song.  People get their fixes from different places.  Okay.  So..... ""Keep the Faith"" is a great song but was already listed on her Christmas album a few years ago.  ""That's God"" is well-written but not a radio hit.  As a whole, not a bad cd, but nothing you want to sing out loud and jam to in the car.

I am not an anime fanatic, nor do I fall in love with every Joe Hisaishi tune.  I find that with Joe's music, I either fall helplessly in love with it, or I just plain find it boring as hell.  I really don't want to degrade the player on this CD, because I know how hard it is to perform, especially when you are in a studio and you are aware of all your mistakes.  This player is good, plays all the right notes.  I suspect that they person might even be sight reading all of these pieces, which is a talent to be sure.  Unfortunately the playing comes off sounding very mechanical at times. Either way, there are some real gems on this album.  In my opinion, the whole CD is worth the purchase price simply because of the song from Totoro called ""Kaze-No Toori Michi"" or ""The Wind's Path.""  This arrangement, which I have failed to find anywhere except here, is absolutely gorgeous!!  Whoever arranged this is simply brilliant!  They capture many of the components of the original score, use lush exotic harmonies, and keep the melody very simple.  The introductory repetitive left hand passage keeps the piece moving giving it an undercurrent of longing, sadness, or maybe just expressing the unbiased non-emotional qualities of nature and the wind?  I don't know, but it reminds me of what a progressive rock keyboardist might do with it like Keith Emerson, or Eddie Jobson.  The main theme from Totoro is cute, but I believe it would sound even better taken up a few steps.  It's played without the happy qualities that it should be played with, and again, very mechanical.  Regardless, I did give it 5 stars because it has many redeeming qualities.",1,0.0

I like the positive theme to the song about learning to always be independent in all areas of your life, and of it being 50/50 in relationships. The song sends a positive message to avoid depending on others to give you what you want, and to instead find ways to obtain your desires through your own means (the group cleverly does this by using lyrics such as ""the shoes on my feet, I bought it"", and with mentioning how they even paid for the place they live in).

First off, I really, really, really wanted to like this album. After reading the stories and reviews I figured this was right up my alley. As a lover of all things pop and bubblegum, I thought this would be on an equal plane of the best Ohio Express, 1910 Fruitgum Co, Association, Archies, Patridge Family all rolled into one.
Alas, it is not to be.
There is nothing memorable here, nothing that will leave you humming the rest of the day. No hit singles to speak of. I've heard this was one of the most expensive albums made at the time. I think they tried and tried and tinkered over and over to perfect the sound and come up with a hit to no avail. The sound is fine, I have it on 180 gram vinyl. It's just the songs. They just sit there, with all their little background noises.
The only song I actually like is I'm With You. It sounds like the aforementioned Association crossed with The Partridge Family.

156,"When I first saw the February 2013 CD release by Real Gone Music titled Beautiful People I thought, at last, a comprehensive compilation covering multiple award-winning Country singer/songwriter Kenny O'Dell, who had 6 Country charters and two on the Billboard Pop Hot 100 from 1967 to 1979. However, the 18-track CD instead offers the 11 sides from his 1967 LP ""Beautiful People"" (Vegas VS-401) together with 7 bonus track from his Vegas/White Whale output. The good news for hits collectors is that you will get all four sides of his two Pop entries - Beautiful People - # 38 Hot 100 in November/December 1967 on Vegas 718 b/w Flower Girl, and Springfield Plane - # 94 Hot 100 in February 1968 on Vegas 722 b/w I'm Gonna Take It.

So, it looks like we're going to have to wait longer for a CD containing these 6 Country hits: You Bet Your Sweet, Sweet Love - # 58 March 1974 - Capricorn 0038 b/w Let's Go Find Some Country Music; Soulful Woman - # 18 Jan/Feb 1975 - Capricorn 0219 b/w Let's Get On The Road; My Honky Tonk Ways - # 37 Country and # 105 Hot 100 Bubble Under June 1975 - Capricorn 0233 b/w Behind Closed Doors; Let's Shake Hands And Come Out Lovin' - # 9 July/Aug 1978 - Capricorn 0301 b/w We Might Be All Nite; As Long As I Can Wake Up In Your Arms - # 12 Dec 1978 - Capricorn 0309 b/w Soulful Woman (re-issue); and Medicine Woman - # 32 April 1979 - Capricorn 0317 b/w Who Do I Know In Denver?

Some of the foregoing appeared in this 1974 LP ""Kenny O'Dell (Capricorn CP-0140) which contains: A1. Soulful Woman; A2. Everything I Am; A3. I'll Find Another Way (To Say I Love You); A4. Lord, Am I Dreamin'?; A5. Let's Get On The Road; A6. Easy Street; B1. Behind Closed Doors; B2. House Of Love; B3. Let's Go Find Some Country Music; B4. I Take It On Home; B5. You Bet Your Sweet, Sweet Love, and in his 1978 album ""Let's Shake Hands And Come Out Lovin'"" (Capricorn CPN-0211) which offers: A1. Let's Shake Hands And Come Out Lovin'; A2. We Can Make Music; A3. When It's Just You And Me; A4. Soulful Woman; A5. Behind Closed Doors; B1. Who Do I Know In Denver?; B2. As Long As I Can Wake Up In Your Arms; B3. We Might Be All Night; B4. Thank You Everlovin'; B5. I Take It On Home.

All we need is for some distributor to pull the different sides in these two LPs together with a bonus track to include My Honky Tonk Ways. That's the very least they could do to honour the writer inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame for writing such gems as Behind Closed Doors, a mega-hit for Charlie Rich, The Judd's Mama He's Crazy, and Loretta Lynn's Trouble in Paradise, just to name a few.",1,0.0

184,"It's surprising how many classic Christmas LPs have never been re-mastered for conversion to CD, none more so than Christmas Carols by Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra which first came out in 1958 as mono Dot 3148 containing: White Christmas; It Came Upon A Midnight Clear; O Holy Night; Deck The Halls; The First Noel; Joy To The World; Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful); Silent Night; God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen; O Tannenbaum (O Christmas Tree); Hark! The Herald Angels Sing; Faith Of Our Fathers; Jingle Bells; O Little Town Of Bethlehem.

Over the years with subsequent reissues there were 3 different covers with the original having a mostly yellow cover and a stylized drawing of a sleigh inside a large red oval (which made it a bit odd in that Sleigh Ride itself was not among the tracks). In 1959 the same album came out in stereo (Dot 3148/25148), with a glossy front cover, ""Billy Vaughn"" in white on a green background and gold-embossed ""Christmas Carols"" on red, with a gold embossed border. When re-issued again a few years later the cover was a flat red, the ""Dot"" logo in its usual 3 colors situated in a green circle, ""Billy Vaughn"" in white and ""Christmas Carols"" in yellow. Charting-wise it made it to # 145 on Billboard's Christmas charts in 1962 and # 101 in 1967.

Some of the tracks have appeared on these CDs: Christmas With Billy Vaughn & His Yuletide Orchestra - 9 of the same tracks in a 10-track 2006 release that includes Auld Lang Syne; Christmas Classics, a 1996 release from Chicago Music Company that contains the same 10 sides; and Christmas Song, a 2012 release from Essential Media Group containing the same line-up. None of these include God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen or White Christmas, nor can I say with any certainty that they are all the same original 1958 renditions.

Why that has never been re-mastered for CD is a puzzle since Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra wasn't just some run-of-the-mill band back then. After being part of the highly-successful Dot vocal quartet known as The Hilltoppers, who had 15 hit singles for the label from 1952 to 1954, he left to form the in-house Dot orchestra in 1954 that would go on to back the vast majority of Dot artists on so many hit singles and albums (e.g. Pat Boone, Gail Storm, The Fontane Sisters, Tab Hunter, Nick Todd (Pat Boone's brother), and many more for years to come.

In the midst of all that, he and his orchestra would rack up some 31 hit singles of their own from their first, Melody Of Love in late 1954/early 1955, to their last in 1967, I Love You (And You Love Me), while selling albums in the millions, 4 of which went Gold: The Golden Instrumentals (1956); Sail Along Silv'ry Moon (1958); Blue Hawaii (1959); and Theme From A Summer Place (1960).

Trivia is fun, but the proof is in the music and this page has sound samples. Each track is clear and whoever did the remastering and mixing did a great job to my ears. You can clearly hear every note, with Eldee Young's bass perfectly in the mix, and Red Holt's exceptional brushwork and drumming coming in crystal clear. I've used this album and its companion as both a study aid and a play-along for getting my own brush chops up to a higher level.

However you do not need to be a musician to enjoy this album. I will be honest and proffer an opinion that the music is competent and enjoyable, but not particularly exceptional.

That's not to say that the trio were not in top form - they were - and they were all virtuoso artists on their instruments. In fact Young was a master on cello (although not on this album) and all three were thoroughly grounded in music theory. However on this album they were just another very good jazz piano trio in a land filled with them. The main value of this album is the glimpse it provides into the trio's early years. That allows we fans to understand the foundation of the powerhouse trio they would become. As they drifted into pop and other forms of music their musical integrity would be called into question by the purists. This album proves otherwise.",1,0.0

226,"Imagine: Guitars that blaze with no reserve, while at the same time keeping the good riffs alive. Drums that stay simple but never let up. Skillful, reverberated vocals that melt steel(e). That certain air about an album that makes the discerned listener think ""80's!"" and throw up the horns instinctively....
These things were part of a style of metal that's now considered stale, untalented, retro, and anything else of the like to many people, shamefully many who are serious fans of metal. The style is straight up meat-and-potatoes heavy metal with no frills and no apologies. A forgotten flag proudly carried in the past by bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Accept, Queensryche, Saint, W.A.S.P., Stormwitch, Fifth Angel....and Sacred Warrior. Make no mistake, Sacred Warrior's debut, Rebellion, is not black metal, death metal, technical progressive algebra metal, beach metal, astral techno Jupiter moon metal, carpenter metal, symphonic metal, core-metal, coffee mug metal, or anything else except guitar heavy, scream filled, in your face American traditional/power metal in the vein of the masters. In other words, this 1988 album serves as a great reminder of just why most metal fans got into metal in the first place. The songs here are simple, but extremely hooky, and always chock full of ultra great, over the top guitar playing and singing. There'll be no sheep heads flying off the stage, no deep nihilistic misanthropic whitebread message, no 'artful' avante garde snobbiness, no crap at all to be found. What there will be is a lot of banging of head due to the solid songwriting to be found here and trying to sing along with vocalist Rey Parra, a criminally overlooked belter in the style of Geoff Tate and Michael Kiske who can easily hold his own with the giants.
Although there is a bit of variation in the overall quality of the songs on Rebellion, there are no real weak ones at all. There is a silly moment or two, such as in the opener, Black Metal - which doesn't seem to have a single thing to do with black metal at all, but does have a good line or two denouncing conformity within metal ('You try so hard to be like everyone else'). A weak melody here and there is also present, but Rey Parra's signature vibrato-drenched screams at the end close it off on a good note. Aside from the B-grade opener every single song is a winner, with some more obvious highlights in some places. Roughly half the album can be classified in the latter group, starting with the third song, Mad, Mad World. This song is simply an unbelievable piece of hard rock influenced, galloping heavy metal. The vocal layering in the chorus is enough to make the song amazing on it's own, but there's also the shredding of guitarist Bruce Swift (easily one of the most underrated metal guitarists), the sledgehammer headbanging part after the second chorus, and some extra virtuosoic vocal work by Parra after the solo.. the man can almost be seen red-faced, singing so hard his vocal cords are sticking out of his throat. Even the lyrics (which speak out about the deceptive and superficial nature of society) are pretty great, which is a good thing. Not that the content itself of the album is bad - there are a lot of uplifting messages of encouragement (Children of the Light, title track), warning (Master of Lies, Stay Away from Evil), and glorification of Jesus Christ (every song). The band's lyric writing ability is simply somewhat pedestrian on this album, so while there is always at least one good line to be found, overall the lyrics are almost too simple and minimalistic. Thankfully, however, they never get awkward or silly, except for a little bit in the aforementioned Black Metal, with the chorus sporting the line, 'Long hair, parted between the eyes/Silk pants, wrapped tight round your thighs/Each day goes by, you're living a dream'. Yes, there's no questioning that it was 1988...
Going back to the rest of the songs, not each song is the best of them, but every song has at least one great <i>defining</i> moment in it (usually the chorus) that really helps make the song, which is why Rebellion is such a solid album. Then, some songs are just top quality, such as Mad, Mad World, Stay Away From Evil, which is a shorter song but has some good riffwork and one of the more infectious choruses to be found, Famine, a mid paced song that harkens directly back to Number of the Beast/Piece of Mind era Iron Maiden and features Rey Parra doing his very best Geoff Tate impersonation, and The Heavens are Calling, another galloper with some fiery solos and more catchy vocal work. The interesting thing about the chorus vocals on this album - like on The Heavens are Calling - is that many times instead of singing different verses with a set melody, there will be only one or two actual lines in the chorus, but introduced by 'general' vocalizations, like a 'Whooaaa, ohh ohhh', which helps give Rebellion a refreshing flair. There is also Children of the Light and Master of Lies, both excellent speed metal songs with big chorus hooks carried by Parra's huge vocal range and Bruce Swift laying down riff after riff and solo after solo. On a small negative note, the drums sound a bit odd on the faster songs - that's not to say that Tony Velazquez does a bad job behind the drumkit, but the drums just seem to be more engineered for the more midpaced, anthemic songs, and so when there's double bass pounding, the drum triggers stick out like a sore thumb. Of course, it could just be chalked up as part of the album's charm depending on your opinion.
The rest of the songs could be considered average, but not filler, which is important when an album has only 11 songs or under. Regardless, there's still something incredibly cool about each one, like the big riff/solo set in the closer, Sword of Victory.
Rebellion is the kind of album everybody who enjoys metal should have at least a few of. There's nothing exactly like being refreshed with straight up well played heavy metal and that's what Sacred Warrior plays best.",1,0.0

This download is made from an old scratchY LP and sounds A W F U L!

On the other side of the coin is that there are other Hugo Winterhalter  Mp3 collections containing the same songs currently available through Amazon. I will be investigating those other versions of this GREAT music and will post my findings here. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION....YOU WON'T BE HAPPY.

This 1981 album, which I downloaded from his website, had many great songs on it about Christian life. As Amazon doesn't list them, I will.

1. Too Small a Price/Joy. A joyful song about the moment Christ appeared in heaven after the resurrection.
2. Since I Met Him. A song about the blind man Christ healed and his reaction to the healing in front of the Pharisees.
3. The Lord and I Together. An upbeat song about walking with the Lord through the day.
4. Beautiful to Me. A song about Jesus defending the woman who washed His feet in Simon the Pharisee's home.
5. If You Ain't Gonna Sing the Gospel. A song about performers who are troubled in their performances. ""If you ain't gonna sing the gospel, you're gonna sing the blues.""
6. Messengers from Heaven. A political song about the US not paying as much attention to God as it used to.
7. The Package. A humorous song about a package from the devil, a package which contained stuff the God would never send to his people. The end, which I won't give away, makes me LOL.
8. You Can't Take It With You. A song that reminds us that what the material possessions we accumulate on earth, stay on earth, that only the things that go with us are those things which are spiritual.
9. Give Your Heart a Home. My favorite song on the album, a song which reminds us that our plastic smiles and faces hide what we really need.

279,"This mp3 download is of the original 1958 RCA VICTOR LP.

.
As far back as 1953, RCA VICTOR experimented with two track recordings. Starting in '55, this company issued a series of stereo reel tapes and when Westrex developed a practical system for stereo LPs a couple of years later, RCA got into this format in a big way. In 1958, their first full year of LIVING STEREO album production, they issued about 200 titles. BOB AND RAY THROW A STEREO SPECTACULAR (LSP-1773) is one of these pioneering records.

It's really a chance for the label to demo this new process and offer samples of their growing stereo catalog. Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding's bits sprinkled throughout the program are excuses for various sound effects. On these segments, cross-channel panning is used to simulate movement across the sound stage. Stereo was a novelty that year, so the wider the spacial effect, the bigger the ""wow!"" factor.

RANDOM NOTES
On ""B & R at the Castle"" we meet hunchbacked 'Gore' (Bob as Karloff) and 'Dr. Akhbar' (Bob doing Peter Lorre). He's Director of Bob and Ray Scientific Research and we're first shown Dr. A.'s experimental fly, 'Neil.'

The ""Minuet on the Rocks"" excerpt is boogiefied Paderewski, with Skitch pounding away at a honky tonk piano. Behind the creaky door of ""The Round Room  is a bagpipe marching band. Besides many unusual percussion instruments in the Schory's ""Buck Dance,"" we also hear tap shoes. Lena's ""New-Fangled Tango"" is a mono 'live' at the Waldorf performance that has the audience giggling. Within the ballroom on ""The Thing"" is a clock with a screaming human pendulum. ""Second Hungarian Rhapsody"" is an edited version of one of the most insane oompah band recordings ever made.

Richard Leibert was Radio City's first-ever organist. His high output holiday song at the keys really gives your speakers a workout. If ""Song of the Volga Boatmen"" sounds like Glenn Miller, there's a good reason. Several Miller alumni play on this recreation of the original Bill Finegan arrangement. The experiments in Dr. A.'s ""Laboratory"" are samples from RCA's sound effects library.

Xavier's Cugat's fourth wife, Abbe Lane (""Whatever Lola Wants"") is a Jewish girl from Brooklyn, born Abigail Lassman in 1932. ""The Ox Drivers"" reflects a popular trend of that day, folk music. Album-closing ""The End"" has shrunk-in-size Bob and Ray as the mad doctor's final experiment.

280,"This album, Pickwick SPC 3274 from early-mid 1971 or so, is a gem of early Glen Campbell Capitol 45 singles' stiffs that pre-date his GENTLE ON MY MIND period.  Songs:

Can't You See I'm Tryin' -- from 45 Capitol 5638 matrix 55467

To put these in perspective, Capitol 5441's 45 A-side was the Brian Wilson/Beach Boys production, ""Guess I'm Dumb,"" Capitol 5504 45 record was GC's ""Universal Soldier"" pop hit in '65, and his first C&W hit with Al DeLory producing was ""Burning Bridges"" on 45 single Capitol 5773.  ""Gentle On My Mind"" was later on Capitol 5939 45 single, which dates July, 1967.  The songs on this Lp, too, are the stereo versions, while the 45s were issued in mono.  If it counts for anything with these el cheapo junk bin parent bait (If you were a kid in the '60s, nagged your parents to bring home that new Beach Boys Capitol Records album, your cheap sneaky parents might go to the Woolworth's el cheapo bin instead and buy that wretched THE SURFSIDERS PLAY THE BEACH BOYS SONGBOOK junker on Design Records, instead of the real thing.  Parent bait.  So BAD it sounded like your parents bought guitars and recorded it in their garage, all in one botched take.  That BAD.), the ""original"" issue of this Pickwick album was pressed on a silver color label (round paper thing at the center of the vinyl Lp record), while it was re-pressed/reissued on a black colored ""P"" logo label in the later 1970s.  Still a junk record.

Songs:  ""Let Me Tell You 'Bout Mary,"" songwriter Bobby Bare, also recorded his version on 500 MILES AWAY FROM HOME, RCA/Victor LPM/LSP 2835 (January, 1964 Lp).  ""Can't You See I'm Tryin'"" (GC Capitol 5638, produced by Steve Douglas) shows songwriting credit to Jerry Fuller-Glen Campbell, and was an Lp track on the Knickerbockers' LIES Challenge 622 Lp, produced by Jerry Fuller ('natch), and recorded by the Forte Four on Decca 31979 45 single, produced by Gary Usher (again:  'natch), with Glen Campbell likely on session guitar on that record, also.

Pickwick was a junk/budget bin label, but occasionally releases on such things featured obscure recordings not on those artists' regular full-list major label releases.  One I could recommend, of somewhat oblique Glen Campbell interest, is LOU RAWLS, COME ON IN MISTER BLUES, Pickwick SPC 3156, which is a comp of Lou Rawls pre-Lp Capitol 1962-ish 45 recordings, and in stereo, Merle Travis's ""Nine Pound Hammer"" with Glen Campbell in the session lineup.

296,"I owned this vinyl lp as a child and still have it, with all the snaps, crackles and pops that go with a late 1950's album. This product is not available (yet) in CD so I was pleased to find it available as an MP3 download here to play for my grandson. After I downloaded the songs I was very dismayed to find the music plays at a much slower speed and lower octave than the original vinyl. This obviously happened when the person or company who transferred the vinyl to digital used a slow playing turntable. Bob Keeshan's voice sounds like a low baritone in this download and the songs drag rather than zip along. I reported this to Amazon the next day and they refunded my money promptly and said they would ""report it"".

The orchestra sounds flat, and there is no brilliance in Noel Coward's performance.

Now, it is GREAT music, and if you don't have it in any format, then its hard to go wrong at $6.99.  But, the album is still common enough in flea markets if you have a record player.

327,"I gave this 5 stars, because it's such a great album...but, the first reviewer was correct... quality is tolerable and better than not having it at all.

THIS IS THE BEST CHRISTMAS ALBUM YOU'LL EVER HEAR OR LOVE! As amazing as it is...you deserve the best possible copy/quality of this recording as you can get!!! For now, that appears to be on used vinyl. This download will do for now and is probably worth the money to download, but, with any luck, someone will find the masters and make us fans, all happy! However, this download will save you the bother of doing the transfer from vinyl yourself until a better quality download or edition on CD comes along!

The title cut, ""Christmas Is For The Family"" and ""I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day"" are cult Christmas classics that are revered by Christmas music fans and a mandatory addition to their collection after you've heard them the first time. I've never heard another rendition of either song done so perfectly. You'll love these two and they will easily make it into your Christmas music rotation. Frankly, either or both should have been released as a singles but, the label (Design Records) was not a ""single"" oriented label. Their catalog pertains to popular artists singing songs that are lesser known than their hits or their early recordings after an artist made it big or accomplished singers/musicians doing covers of big tunes. Needless to say, some of these LP's, like this one were destined to become classics. Had ""Christmas Is For The Family"" or ""I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day"" been released as singles the year this LP was released, either would have done very well and would now be staples of Christmas music rotation on radio airwaves both local free and satelite radio and more than likely given Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"" a run for it's money as the biggest selling Christmas records of all time. ""May Santa Fill Our Hearts"" is another cut on this LP that is another cult classic, and I've never heard another cover of the song. There is some great original material on this LP as well as standards.

On ""Christmas Is For The Family"", side one is ""Popular"" Christmas Classics with stunning lush arrangements wrapped around Dennis Day's voice with full studio orchestra, featuring Lou Hollingsworth at the Wurlitzer Organ, and the Vail Boys Choir. Side two is more of a ""Traditional"" Christmas Classics that you might hear in Church, mostly done with Lou at the Organ and the boys choir again, in arrangements to stir emotions in even the coldest of souls at Christmas Time.

Jack Benny's appearance as ""Santa"" playing the violin on the cover, as well as Jack playing, speaking and singing at the begining and the end of side one and the beginning of side two and another little cameo at the end is a nice bit of nostalgia from when Dennis used to appear regularly on Jack's Television Show that I'm sure was designed to boost LP sales.

Now, aside from that, this is the finest Christmas album you'll ever hear from a man with a voice that was a gift that was meant to sing Christmas Songs, Irish Folk Songs, as well as be shared with the masses.

I am on my 3rd pressing of this Christmas Classic and 4 years ago, I spent over a month, finding pristine copies of this LP to give as Christmas gifts to members of my family who have fond memories of Christmas due to this fine recording.

Unfortunately, IT'S NOT available on CD, YET! I just wish someone could find the masters and have enough sense to re-release it so we can all enjoy this amazing Christmas Classic. Until such time, you'll have to do like I did...get one coverted to CD to get you by till the real thing comes along.",1,1.0

Other instruments are sarod, sitar, santoor, sarangi, shenai, and tabla and pakhwaj drums. The notes say that the recording was done 'live' with all the musicians together. Acoustic guitar and keyboard are used sparingly.

If you like one album in this series, you'll like them all (I have about 10). Instrumental songs which are rooted in classical musics of India (the raag of each is noted), but given contemporary ensemble arrangements, slightly like what you'd hear in a western jazz ensemble with the 'head' of the song and multiple solos. The resulting songs, most less than 10 minutes, are probably more accessible to the uninitiated western listener than the 'pure classical' musics of India.",1,1.0

They've done the same idea when they've mixed two rock classics together into one song, by mixing Bon Jovi's Livin' On A Prayer, and the classic Rolling Stones anthem Start Me Up, it feels like the killjjoy of 2 die hard fans into one badly made opus. It feels like the songs from the Rock Of Ages musical feel like a better novelty to listen to than what the cast of Glee has done with beautiful songs. I also think the producers of Glee should try and deliver more original songs than the feeling of covers being more like gags with crescent rolls.

* Research Notes: Mantovani albums are a little difficult to research now for someone like myself who was not there to be collecting them at the time.  While I have about 50 Mantovani LP albums, most from my parent's collection and some purchased used, most do not have dates printed on them anywhere.  The current best source of album listings that I have found is at[...].  Wikipedia's Mantovani page lists 2 additional Christmas albums: Christmas Carols, London LL 913; and Merry Christmas to All of You, Decca 66445009 (1963).  I cannot find any other references to either of these albums anywhere.  There is an extensive LP (and even old 78s) listing on the mantovani-orchestra(dot)com site, but it does not include many US albums that I own and it appears that the catalog numbers there are non-US.

350,"The 1964 RCA VICTOR LP entitled Let's Ring the Bells ALL AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE (LPM/LST-2914) is a souvenir of the New York World's Fair. It includes an album-sized four page booklet, ""Of Bells and Carillons,"" from which comes much of the trivia here.

The RCA and Coca-Cola pavilions were close neighbors at the Fair. Victor's John Klein was also musical director for Coke and the Carillonneur of their pavilion's centerpiece, what was then the world's largest carillon: a 120-foot tower housing 610 chimes capable of many different tones: Flemish bells, Harp, Lute, Aeolian, Baroque, Celestial and several others.

The original carillons were far simpler devices that required many ringers to operate a few roped bells that weighed tons. Modern carillons are electro-mechanical marvels controlled by keyboards, stops and pedals, their sounds created by miniature bronze bells weighing mere ounces instead of pounds or tons. The secret is a series of audio amplifiers and speakers. The Coca-Cola carillon had 57 directional speakers (stentors), some five-feet across, that projected 3,000 watts of amplified sound.

Principal recordings for ""All Around the Christmas Tree"" of Henry Ren&eacute;'s orchestra and chorus were made at Webster Hall in NYC. Master tapes, equipment and engineers then relocated to Flushing Meadow, Queens and the Coke pavilion, where Mr. Klein added his bells on a separate tape track. The results are nothing less than remarkable, what sounds like a concert of perfectly blended orchestra, voices and carillon.

One of the most unique holiday albums ever, this one gets a highest recommendation!

352,"Christmas Bells, with organist Richard Keys Biggs, is a rare find nowadays in any format.  It originally appeared in the 50s on a monaural LP (Capitol T-9013).  It is that edition which I found at Amazon (Sold by Looney Geeks).  Given the rarity of the recording, one must be prepared to accept pops and crackles, and there are a goodly sprinkling of those throughout both sides.  The sound, of course, is typical of the early days of high fidelity.  That said, the record is well worth owning if you can find a copy.  The carols are played with deep and heart-felt simplicity, with no fancy arranging.  The chimes are very well used to accentuate the simple directness of Biggs' interpretations of a goodly selection of the most beloved carols.  The only drawback with regard to the copy I received is that it was plainly advertised as an audio CD (which obviously it is not).  I had fully expected the item to be a remake by someone from the original vinyl, and am somewhat disappointed that such was not the case.  By and large, though, the quality of the disc is quite acceptable although the price ($24.95) iwas a bit steep, given that the disc is not in pristine condition.

355,"Although there is no information about this recording on Amazon, I believe it is the 1962 D'Oyly Carte version originally issued on vinyl as London OSA 1248. At the time it was the the best recording you could buy. However, presumably due to the constraints imposed by 4 sides of vinyl, the Finale is missing four verses starting with ""Having been a wicked baronet a week."" I really missed them at the time since they are among my favorite parts: who wouldn't like ""For to settle in the town of Basingstoke."" I was hoping that this rerelease would include the missing material, but it does not.

I have ripped my own vinyl and I was also hoping this would be a cleaner version, but its not. The sound quality is quite poor.

I wish that someone would find the missing verses (they must have been recorded) and clean up the sound and re-rerelease this. That effort would likely produce the best Ruddigore available.",0,0.0

359,"I was skeptical when I heard about this compilation of music because, as a huge RUSH fan, I expected it to really fall short. Apparently DARKSTAR originally had a bunch of great, classic RUSH songs as the soundtrack, and due to some crappy Hollywood greed tactics by Universal, the Producers dumped the idea and replaced the songs with their own, custom scored music. It is amazing, and truly lives up to the expectations one would expect of a AAA touring act. The music ranges from eerie, ambient tracks to full out rockers.  Jimmy Pitts on keyboards is epic, his style more aligned to virtuosic guitar work like you'd expect from Vai, but the guitar neck laid out on a table for the talented Pitts to burn up with hand-played arpeggios and leads that seem impossible on keyboards. Likewise, Bill Bruce is phenomenal with his tasteful passages, grinding rhythms, and signature classical guitar riffs mixed with well written layered leads.  If you're a fan of Vai, Zappa, TSO, Rush, Yes, and all progressive, this is the record for you.",1,1.0

423,"Don't let the name ""Foetus"" fool you--when I was first recommended Thirlwell's music, I though it was going to be some terrible goth or metal nonsense.  How wrong I was.

Everyone who knows me knows that I am almost pathologically obsessed with Thirlwell's musical output.  Despite his proclivity it seems like nobody knows who he is--and even when you find a Foetus fan (usually online) discussing his music they focus on some of his older stuff, like NAIL or HOLE.  The problem here is not that Thirlwell got worse over time--the problem is is that he attracted lot of fans of the overly broad designation of ""industrial music.""  The result is that many of those that do know who he is cling to the era when his sound was closer to early ""industrial"" and noise music.

If there is anything Thirlwell is not, it is being an artist that has the same sound over his entire career.  In some ways it's hard to believe that the same genius that created NAIL also produced this fantastic orchestral brilliance.  In fact, the Thirlwell of the past--usually wearing some guise, most famously the  ""Clint Ruin"" persona--seems radically different from the Thirlwell we see today.  Compare the pictures of Thirlwell back then standing amid impaled hog heads to him in a suit conducting for a live performance of Manorexia.  Thirlwell has never been content to stay in the same place.

Every Thirlwell album, then, is a delightful new surprise, and I had waited for this album in near-agony, and the delays only compounded by impatience.  Remember how excited you used to get near Christmas back during your childhood?  That's how I felt waiting for this album to finally arrive into my mailbox, except in this case, Christmas was delayed at least twice due to Santa Claus to finally get his sleigh painted the right color before leaving the North Pole. (This metaphor makes sense only to those that followed the delays of this album).  A little voice inside me wondered how Thirlwell could top LOVE, and how I'd probably be disappointed after all that waiting, because I'm just negative that way.  Foetus isn't often very uplifting to listen to, so I suppose I can be forgiven for my pessimism.  Fortunately, I was glad I was wrong--this may be Thirlwell's best album yet, and it's probably my favorite.  He took what made LOVE so good and made it even better.

HIDE is a concept album with held together by the themes of fear, paranoia, and uncertainty; lyrical references throughout are apocalyptic (particularly ""Oilfields"") and numerous references to fear-stirring events that were current during the album's production (e.g., ""anthrax in the envelope""), and it seems that Thirlwell envisioned the album as being the sountrack to a movie that exists only within his own head--which is something you may expect from an artist that already outputs fantastic cinematically-inspired pieces (check out Manorexia!) and has expressed a desire to score for a big-budget movie. Cosmetics, for example, comes across as a bombastic, operatic opening while O Putrid Sun sounds like something that would play to rolling credits after a downer of an ending.  Throughout Thirlwell adeptly mixes ""haunting"" with ""beautiful"" and does so over a large range of style.  I'll let other reviewers go more in-depth over the individual songs, they're better at describing them than I am.

Also, I forgot to describe the cover art.  For a lack of proper adjectives I'll close this review by stating that it's ""pretty friggin' awesome,"" which you can see for yourself.",1,0.0

HIGHLIGHTS:
-Guitars operate on FOF's well known grand scale, creating great audio landscapes, especially on ""Do you hear what I hear?""-------really feel like a shepherd out on that incredible night.
-Instrumental track isn't a simply filler, but is really a great intro into the epic rendition of ""Pie Jesu"".  Works great.
-Nice balance between symphonic guitars, acoustic, vocals and piano.  ""Angels We Have Heard on High"" has a kind of coffee house feel to it, and then ""The Earth Stood Still"" nearly brings tears to your eyes.  Amazing musical diversity between 6 tracks.
DRAWBACKS:
-4 stars only because it's an EP--------------I guess if you combine it with the 1st ""Advent"", you kind of have a full-length Christmas album.  It's just short, and you're thirsting for more by the end of ""Pie Jesu"".

The EP itself starts off alright. The chanting at the beginning of the first track made me a little excited, but as soon as the lead singer came in, I was immediately turned off. His voice is extremely nasally. It's a good thing that the EP is only 14 minutes (not a single song over the 3 minute mark), because his voice is painful. The guitarwork, drumming, and keyboards are all great, and it's a shame that they have such a terrible singer.

458,"Album from 1958 by the brilliant flamenco guitarist Sabicas (1912-90), which (as far as I'm aware) has never appeared on CD.

This song is worthy of more attention. Michael could sing the phonebook and I'd listen.

482,"An&uacute;na's first Christmas album, ""Christmas Songs,"" did not contain one track that failed to deliver the group's signature haunting choral arrangement of folk, ecclesiastical, traditional and classical/ancient pieces.  Listening to these initial samples of this one, I can say with a fair amount of confidence if you own that first Christmas album, I am here to tell you that you are likely to be disappointed with ""Christmas with An&uacute;na.""

The only tracks on this disc that fully capture that haunting beauty that we have come to love in and expect from An&uacute;na are ""Nol Nouvelet"" and ""Sanctus,"" and this latter has already long been available on their first album.

Not that all the others are bad.  ""Angelus ad Virginam"" is a little bit different from their original arrangement - a little bit more of a tribal Celtic folk beat to it, but still enjoyable and choral.  The child solist in ""Away in a Manger"" is sweet, but set against the old backing ""Oooo""s of the piece it feels kind of like a cheap cop-out.  ""Ding Dong Merrily on High"" and ""Codail a Linbh"" seem promising, but the arrangements start to stray almost more into the nauseous nostalgia, rather than choral, category of Christmas music.

This perhaps wouldn't be so noticable except that the other tracks stray progressively further in that direction, and ""Christmas Memories,"" ""Christmas Kisses"" and ""Angels Are Singing"" are clearly vanity puff-pieces arranged in the manner of the dreaded Christmas nostalgia soloist album.  All of them are absolute disasters, and completely unexpected from An&uacute;na.

Had they done away with these last three tracks and gotten rid of ""O Tannenbaum"" (an upbeat carol that does NOT work with choral arrangements no matter how much you wish it did), ""The First Nol"" (a sappy song that will ALWAYS sound like nostalgia music no matter how hard you try) and ""Away in a Manger"" (which, though not bad here, suffers terribly in comparison to the arrangement on the first album) and tried just a little bit harder to find good ecclesiastical motets or other traditional folk songs in other European languages (and there are plenty), that might have made up for the mediocrity of the other tracks.  Unfortunately, the few really good tracks make the rest of the album VERY pale by comparison.",0,0.0

He has never displayed any respect for composers intentions, plays everything the way he ""likes"" and always with a tight, hypernervous and unrelaxed approach to the keyboard that makes anything he does fatiguing to the ear and sometimes the eye.

As bad as his RCA recordings are, these DGG recordings makes them sound trancendantal.  I keep a few of them in my vast CD collection of mostly super quality recordings for comparison purposes only, to illustrate what a crappy pianist and musician he was.  By the time these DGG recordings were made, he was so past any considerations concerning correct style and composer's intentions that the interpretations, if you want to call them that, are completely haywire.  DGG must have recorded them only for the subsequent monetary rewards.  To ""musicians"" like Horowitz, the music they play is nothing more than the fancy clothes they put on to impress the intellectually vapid and ignorant.

TZVI EREZ, piano

This album is an absolute treat for Beethoven enthusiasts. Hard to believe that on one album or CD you find five (5)  Sonatas, namely the Moonlight Sonata as well as the Sonata Pathetique, consisting of three parts each, also Sonatas No. 13 and 17, plus the well known ""Fur Elise"" and the Spring Sonata - all compliment this outstanding musical treat. The last item on his program is the lovely Sonatina Anh. 5-Romanze- Andante, which no doubt, you will adore, as I do.  This program has been carefully chosen by Mr. Erez, who interprets Beethoven in an absolute realistic  exercise. This pianist`s touch is gentle where required and temperamental  where necessary, which creates an exiting interpretation of the music, yet at all times he strictly adheres to the composer's writings. These works are  performed on a 1912 Vintage Bosendorfer, which needs no introduction.  This certainly will be a nice addition to your Beethoven collection.",1,0.0

Because of IODA's claim, YouTube slapped a link to this piece of music on my video. Basically, the link says that if you want to buy the music from my video, you could click and buy that piece of music from Amazon, GooglePlay or iTunes.

I clicked on the link to Amazon to see if perhaps there might be some legitimate reason IODA thought the music in my video was this and not the actual GarageBand loop I used. It turns out there isn't.

As I said, I used a happy, peppy, electronic GarageBand loop, and this piece of music is depressing, slooooooowwww, and not electronic. I think it's all real instruments, including what sounds like several violins--when there are no violins in the GarageBand music I used--and what I think might be a didgeridoo and a jaw harp. I'm no music expert, but I can tell the difference between happy, peppy, electronic music and depressing, slow, real instruments. IODA's claim is like claiming Beethoven wrote the music for You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.

""The Dream That Dreams Us"" is, in my opinion, bad enough, but to claim that this is the same music as that on someone else's video--when it clearly isn't--is outrageous. IODA found a way to get YouTube to provide free advertising for their music at the expense of others, and YouTube doesn't provide video owners with any way to object. IODA gets to be plaintiff, judge and jury. Here, though, I can tell you the truth, so you don't have to fall for it.",0,1.0

558,"It's 1979 and the Disco trend is in full swing.  Every song on the radio features chants, funky basslines, percussive breakdowns and whistles.  Some performers of this genre of music could either make the transition to the Post-Disco format and some could not.  Thankfully, Payne DID with an underground hit in 1982 entitled, ""In Motion"" on Sutra Records.  Prior to that, her last outing was this, her Capitol swansong.

On ""Hot,"" Capitol seemed to have locked her into a chugging, Latin-flavored, Anita Ward-ish ""Ring My Bell"" sound with the first single, ""Red Hot,"" but there was only one problem- the only bell being rung was the gong.  This was NOT a reflection on Payne, but on Capitol, her label, with its typical lack of artist promotion.  If you're a fan of traditional Disco formats, this album may be for YOU.

Despite sexy photography, festive uptempos and beautiful balladry, this album as well as its two predecessors (""Supernatural High"" and ""Stares and Whispers"") didn't even touch the Disco/Dance chart.  All three titles are worth exploring and are highly recommended.  Additionally, you won't need any Q-Tips for THIS kind of Payne in your ears!

Here's a little trivia for ya TOO:  Prior to her signing with Capitol, who offered her a better financial option, she was offered a deal with Philadelphia International Records under Gamble & Huff.  Sadly, she didn't opt for the latter which just MIGHT HAVE proved the more beneficial choice for her career.  :-(",1,1.0

603,"I just downloaded the 2010 ""remastered"" version of the song ""With A Spirit"" from the album ""The Hits"", and I was shocked by the over compression. The song was completely smothered by pumping and wheezing effects due to poor compression techniques. Very unprofessional approach. Whoever remastered the song had NO IDEA what they were doing. Mastering is as much art as science, and tracks can get totally messed up if you do it wrong. Mastering is much more than just compression. And trust me, I am no GOLDEN EARS audiophile. The effect is VERY pronounced, and very detrimental to the quality of the song.

Because of the poor quality of the remastered version, I chose to download the original 2009 version of ""With A Spirit"" from the album ""009 Sound System"" to see if it might be better, and the difference was like night and day. The original version sounds much, much better. No extreme compression. No pumping and wheezing effect. Very good dynamics, with crisp highs and rich lows. Plus I was surprised to see that the bitrate of the original version mp3 was higher than the remastered version... 292 kbps for the original 2009 version as opposed to only 280 kbps for the 2010 remastered version.

Listening to them side by side, you can definitely hear a big difference. The remastered version sounds muddy and squished. The original sounds clear and dynamic. So definitely get the original 2009 version. It is a higher bitrate file, and just plain sounds better. It is 39 seconds shorter than the remastered version, but you hardly miss 39 seconds in a 10 minute song. DO NOT get the ""remastered"" version if you care about audio quality!",0,0.0

633,"I first encountered Richard Campbell's work through the Rock Band video game, where his ""A Christmas Rock Medley"" was sold as an addon song for the game.  I loved the track and went looking for more.  I found Orpheus, listened to a few samples, and bought the album.

This has joined my list of favorite albums in just the few weeks I've had it.  It's a progressive rock concept album, like Rush's 2112 or Dream Theater's Metropolis Part 2.  It tells the story of Orpheus and Eurydice, a Greek myth about Orpheus, a legendary musician who marries a beautiful woman.  She is killed in an accident, and Orpheus goes to the underworld to beg the gods to return her to life.  Hades takes pity on him and agrees that he can have Eurydice back on the condition that he walk out of the underworld without looking behind him to see her face.  Orpheus leaves the underworld but looks back before Eurydice manages to join him, and she is condemned to the underworld.  A short snippet of another myth is brought in--Orpheus is killed by Thracians--and the chorus closes the tale.

The instrumentals are all performed by Campbell, who is veritable polymath of music: he plays drums, guitar, keyboard, and bass on this album.  He also wrote the arrangements, as well, and his enjoyment of Dream Theater shines through here; this album may not be as complicated as a typical DT track, but it could easily be mistaken for a side project from any of the members of DT.

This is the pleasing mix of the New Seekers material that those who rememebr them will expect to find but it doesn't show the wider range of their music or vocal dexterity.  The recordings cover the prime 1970 to 1974 period and feature the Marty, Eve, Paul, Peter [Doyle]and Lyn line up. A few tracks recorded in 1973 and 1974 have Peter [Oliver] replacing his name sake who quit the band in 1973.
The mix of Circles is a horrible rehersal style mix where music and vocals simply don't blend and I can only think Polydor must have lost the excellent verson that was originally released.
Beg, Steal or Borrow was hardly the New Seeker's greatest hit although it brought them internaational recognition as the UK 1972 Eurovision Song Contest entry.  The excellent B side to that original single One by One features on this CD as do a few lesser known album tracks Brother Loves Travelling Salvation Show with lead vocal by Peter Oliver and the enjoyable frothy Dance Dance Dance - the first NS album track I ever heard nearly thirty years ago.
All together a happy journey down memory lane but the New Seekers music deserves a more ambitious compilation next time.

They never toured or performed live as such, so these names were simply a foil to release their own material directly, rather than through other artists they were producing. Despite their generous output as writers, the biggest hit they had was ""New York is Lonely Town"" which only reached #33 on the Billboard charts. Kama Sutra records went bankrupt in the late '60s, the remnants of which morphed into Buddhah Records. The Tradewinds original vinyl LP, ""Excursions"" was very short in playing time, just over 12"" a side. In order to extend it to a more acceptable length for CD release, it now includes two tracks by The Good Times. Still, it only clocks in at just over 28"", which is very short for a CD.  Although produced by Anders and Poncia, The Good Times are a different group entirely from the Tradewinds.  (I should know, my brother, Tim, was the lead guitarist.) They had two singles on Kama Sutra and an unreleased album that was largely produced by the Anders-Poncia team.  On this Tradewinds CD, Pete and Vinnie wrote each track, including ""The Hard Life,"" but not ""That's When Your Heartaches Begin"", an old Elvis tune.  Although they produced this track, and Vinnie played piano on it, they neither wrote this song nor sang on it. These two tracks, along with ""New York's a Lonely Town"", are in mono, not stereo.  They may have been taken from the vinyl records, rather than the original masters. In my opinion, it would have been better to release the Tradewinds album and Innocence album together as a ""two for one"" combination for those interested in the Anders-Poncia writing team. That would have been a better value, and more honest.  In any case, The Good Times album, originally scheduled for release as KLPS 8052, remains in the vaults.",0,0.0

725,"This CD is an introductory CD to a whole series of some 25 produced by Michael Haas and recorded and released by Decca.  I think it's one of the most important things that's happened in classical music recording in the past 20 years.  That's because Haas is a real scholar, and he has gone to great lengths to make this series as thorough as his Decca budget would allow, and to record music by a wide variety of composers  -- some who made it and some who didn't.  In fact, if you become interested in this topic, as I did, Haas has recently released an excellent book on this topic, published by Yale, I think.

The performances are all strong. This CD gives you short cuts by lots of composers, not complete works.  But it gives you an idea of the incredible richness of the (mostly Jewish) musical scene in Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia in the 1920's and early 1930's.",1,1.0

731,"This is an hour-long story about an improbable partnership between General Motors and Toyota to jointly run an auto plant in Fremont, California. The JV was formed in 1984 and ran the plant until its closing in April 2010.  It was called New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., but everyone called it ""NUMMI."" It's a fascinating narrative, with interviews of workers, labor leaders, management from the plant and business school faculty.  This is one of the best radio pieces you'll ever hear.  Although the two companies were fierce competitors, each needed the other at the time.  GM needed to learn how to build high-quality small cars efficiently.  Toyota had never made a car in America and wanted a local partner for its first plant here.  Toyota chose GM's Fremont assembly plant, which had been closed down as one of the worst-performing factories in the country.  Interviews with workers recounted incidents of drugs, sex, intentional sabotaging of cars, absenteeism so massive that managers would run down to the local bar to round up day workers, and constant labor-management fights.  Contrary to almost everyone's advice, Toyota re-hired the vast majority of what was reputed to be one of the worst work forces in the auto industry.  These blue-collar, hard-drinking American workers were sent to Japan to train alongside Japanese workers in Toyota City to learn the Toyota Way.  Tape from those trips revealed a remarkable transformation.  Almost from the day it opened, the NUMMI plant had the highest quality of any auto plant in the U.S.  Its operations were radically different from any auto plant in America.  During its lifetime, the plant produced 8 million high-quality cars, mostly Toyota Corollas.  This program tells how this transformation was accomplished, why GM failed to learn from it and why Toyota knew GM could not copy the Toyota Way (ultimately leading to GM's bankruptcy).  The story is told by Frank Langfit in a joint production by NPR and WBEZ/This American Life.",1,1.0

746,"As one of Michael W. Smith's biggest fans, and also a bluegrass affectionado, when I saw this in the store the other day I was genuinely excited.  However, I have been pretty disappointed in what I've heard. Overall, the album is lackluster and has an ""easy-listening"" feel to it.  Secondly, there are no vocals, and MWS' music really isn't his without them.  Thirdly, there are at least five tracks on the album that aren't even MWS songs.  Sure, MWS recorded ""Awesome God,"" but if I were Rich Mullins, I'd be offended that one of his most famous songs is on an MWS tribute album, since it was him that made it famous and not Smith.  The same goes for ""Breathe"" and ""Above All"", which MWS recorded, but are not necessarily ""associated"" with him.  All it would have taken was to poll some fans before hitting the studio and this would have been avoided.

On the plus side, the music is extremely meditative, as I alluded to with my ""easy listening"" comment.  Therefore, it makes for good calming ambiance music. If that's what you're looking for, you'll not be disappointed, but for authentic MWS and authentic bluegrass, look elsewhere.",0,1.0

And Philidor was no slouch at composing either (mostly opera-comique) during the era of Gluck, Monsigny, and Gretry in Paris. ""Le Sorcier""is a two-act work, a kind of Singspiel in French (no recitative, just spoken dialogue) somewhat in the folk-opera style of Rousseau's ""La devin du village"" from a decade earlier. The premiere of ""Le Sorcier"" in Paris in 1764 was moderately successful, and the very young Mozart was in town at the time; it's possible that ""Le Sorcier"" could have influenced Mozart in his own young Singspiel composing.

The problem here is the performance.  It's.....awful. (It pains me to say that.)  The singing is the main culprit:  sopranos wobble all over the place, and tenors sometimes can't even reach up to hit the notes they're supposed to.  The orchestral work, while not as bad, is nothing memorable. The excuse that this is a provincial group (the Orchestre de Rennes) doesn't fly; in classical-performer-rich Europe, even local groups can often turn in excellent performances, and there might even be a few U.S. university groups that could do better than this.  The one minor positive here is that, since all the performers are French, pronunciation during the spoken dialogue is excellent.  Indeed, one occasionally gets the impression that the performers believed they were putting on a play with music segments.

But ""Le Sorcier"" is a fun, saucy work that is worthy of a better recording.  This is the ideal kind of work for Ryan Brown and his Opera Lafayette, who've turned in several excellent performances of works from this period.",0,0.0

Walking Far from Home is a brilliant track that finally seems to give Sam a voice instead of the whisper we all know and love.  And what a voice!  Even though the song is amazing, this track seems to be a little over mastered.  And sadly that continues to the other two.
Summer in Savannah when played live has such depth to its sound.  Over-mastered and flat sound on the recording.
Hearing Biting your Tail this way scares me.

I've tried a stand-alone white noise machine, but that particular one wasn't loud enough to mask anything, even on its highest volume.  So I looked for a CD of white noise or box fan sound effect.  Until I started looking, I didn't realize there were other ""colors"" of noise.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  It has a deeper or lower tone than white noise, so it doesn't sound as harsh, IMO.  I just wish I'd've found this cheap solution before I bought a box fan and a white noise machine!

Man-Permer brood of conductors (Rattle, Dudamel and Ticciati) - do your worst! But beyond good and evil and whatever bell curves you care to nominate, there lies the domain of Maximiano Cobra, the Sauron of his profession and breaker of nations. Exposition and developmental repeats, invariably observed, are his Nazgl. Who has the wherewithal to withstand his onslaughts? There are reports that Saddam Hussein loaded up on his discography as WMDs - and indeed, the Scuds that were fired off at Israel in the First Gulf War had their warheads removed and replaced with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/J-S-Bach-Die-Kunst-Der-Fuge-The-Art-of-Fugue-Bwv/dp/B003O9I0YM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">J.S. Bach-Die Kunst Der Fuge-The Art of Fugue Bwv</a>. Should Cobra wear the blame for Operation Iraqi Freedom and the subsequent barbarism that ensued? Could be.

Here, he annihilates K 550. Not one stone is left upon another. Brace yourself. As Selina says in The Dark Knight Rises, ""There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits, you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us.""

First movement - 13'56""
Second Movement - 25'07"" (verily, this is ground zero).
Minuet 9'38""
Finale - 19'46""

I think that Cobra is using the second version. With steam coming out of my ears, I cannot say for sure. The development in the finale of K 550 is reputed to represent someone going mad. Evidence is now at hand - just look in the mirror!

I was once a member of the Old Firm. It's not about moral judgments or existential bets anymore. Jesus and the Blessed Virgin can only do so much. I'm beyond that. My old allegiances have been burnt away. Bear Grylls is now my god - praised be his holy name!

Insofar as I'm still capable of thought, here's Uncle Karl B&ouml;hm at his funereal worst (Vienna Philharmonic):

First Movement - 8'55""
Second Movement - 8'07""
Minuet - 5'11""
Finale - 4'58""

There have been some suggestions that MC's orchestra is computer generated. I do not believe that for one second. An investigative journalist (Bob Woodward) once told me that its constituents spent time in the Soviet Gulag - indeed, most of them broke bread with Alexander Solzhenitsyn in the camps beyond the Arctic Circle. Trust me: they should have stayed there.

To add to the terror, one ""George Schatzkamer"" (remember his name when the wolves howl at night) routinely claims on Amazon that Cobra is the equal of ""Furtw&auml;ngler, Knappertsbusch, Klemperer, Mengelberg (and) Golovanov."" Under normal circumstances, I'm not a conspiracy buff but I wonder whether this Seinfeld-inspired figure is hardwired to Cobra himself.

930,"For those of you old enough to remember the Rumiko Takahashi anime Maison Ikkoku, this song will sound spooky familiar. That's because this is a ""21st Century Version"" of the show's original opening title theme, titled ""Hello! Sadness"" in the United States. Both the original version and this new recording are performed by Saito Yuki.

The original song was released in 1986, with this version being released in 2007. That's a 21 year gap, guys and girls. Ignoring for a moment how old that makes me feel, I have to confess that I wasn't initially very keen on the new version. There's definitely a lot of nostalgia tied to the original recording, but that's not the only problem. 1980s J-pop has a very particular kind of sound, one that I grew fond of over my many viewings of Japanese anime from the era. There are some great synth elements to the original recording of ""Hello! Sadness"" that are simply missing from the new arrangement, with new elements being added in for flourish (such as the occasional touch of electric guitar). I suppose this was done to give it a more modern feeling.

After getting over the initial nostalgia shock, I really grew to appreciate the new recording. Saito's performance is still relaxed and beautiful, and the new arrangement is  just as moving now as the original was then. I sort of wish the album would have included the original cut as well -- you can't currently find it for sale on Amazon -- but that aside, the song is well worth it if you like melodic J-pop or were a fan of Maison Ikkoku.",1,1.0

933,"Rick Cutler's latest collection of piano instrumentals is a moody and evocative affair worthy of the album's equally atmospheric title and cover.

The 18 tracks contained on the CD are very cinematic in feel, which should come as no surprise since Cutler writes and performs music for film and television. He also served as Gregory Hines's keyboardist and musical director for 18 years and currently tours as Liza Minnelli's drummer, and has also worked with scores of other notable artists in between, giving Cutler an edge as a brilliant composer and a seasoned musician.

Cutler is a crafty tunesmith, always drawing you in with captivating hooks, sometimes giving you what you anticipate, and other times taking you in unexpected directions, yet leaving you musically satisfied. The compositions, which include tips of the hat to such classical and jazz influences as Debussy and McCoy Tyner, are subtle and understated and function as a sort of tonic for the psyche.

Interspersed throughout the album are three ""Alien Landscapes"" that exemplify Cutler's simultaneously adventurous and eerie sensibilities. With the CD as a whole, Cutler has definitely cultivated an artistically and intellectually stimulating sonic landscape for inner reflection and deep reverie.",1,1.0

961,"Gail's voice has been beautiful in song for many years. Her unique ability to capture in lyrics the highs and lows of life and love in a deeply spiritual way are proven true in her first CD, ""Prayers from the Heartland."" Her lyrics are included in the CD, and are poetry to read. Her partner in singing, David Chaidez, blends in his rich tonal's with Gail's lilting, floating grace notes. Grace in the deeper sense of the word. The 8th track, ""One Woman's Song for Love"", is especially beautiful to me.

973,"I had heard the opening fragment of the first track 'Red House' somewhere and thought this promises to be an interesting, modern, arrangement of an eighteenth-century country dance. Buying the CD proved to be a big disappointment.  It is as though they do not think the melodies are able to stand on their own; from the very start of each track the tunes are decorated in, to my mind, a rather sickly fashion, where all the musicians must play something, however fragmented, all the time.  The pianist comes in for most of the blame here, vigorously scaling, arpeggiating and trilling all over the place so that the humbler wind and string players are relegated to the background even if they have the principal theme : not that the principal theme stays constant for very long as previously mentioned.  There is an overall impression of improvisation which, praiseworthy when done well, often results here in strange harmonies and overlaps which undermine the shape and feeling of the piece so that major or minor tonality has barely any effect.  Incessant decorative twiddles and runs of the piano in a higher register than the main theme trivialise all the pieces and become very tiresome thoughout.  The pianist is obviously a dominant member of the group and quite skilled, but should have been toned down in the recording for overall balance.  String and wind players play tiny irrelevant fragments when the piano has what should be a solo.  It seems as though they reach a consensus about a chord and as long as each plays something vaguely belonging to that chord it will be OK.  Inevitably, the rhythms suffer, indeed, are sometimes lost in this jumble.  As a country dancer of nearly 40 years experience I have survived many dances where live music has failed to live up to its expectation: this is the first commercially produced CD of country dance music I have bought which leaves me with the same feelings.",0,1.0
974,"Michael Milton
Through the Open Door (Music For Missions)
Released January 2011
Robert Ham
Style: Acoustic folk/country; compare to Neil Young, Steven Curtis Chapman, Dan Fogelberg

Top tracks: ""Eclogue for the Church Triumphant,"" ""Mississippi-Louisiana Line,"" ""The Gadarene""

Is there anything Michael Milton can't do? He's written numerous books, leads the Reformed Theological Seminary, and hosts a Bible study program on DIRECTV. And he has now released three CDs of plaintive spiritual folk that are musically opulent and emotionally stirring. Milton and his collaborators--including singer/songwriter Michael Card--have crafted an uncommonly varied set of songs, ably tackling bluegrass, lite rock, and country. It skews too heavily on the side of mellow, leisurely paced material, but still pulls off some unexpected moments like the arresting strings and piano that mark the closing track, ""Eclogue for the Church Triumphant,"" which, heard free of Milton's reading from Revelations 21:5, reminded me of no less than the Lou Reed/John Cale collaboration Songs for Drella.

Virtues are characteristic of Leitner: good tempi and orchestral balance, forward winds,, good brass and tympani. #102/4 is played with elan. The military music in 100/2
is moderate where excess sometimes works.  Leitner's more recent Haydn was more successful (#6-8, 5,54, 92,98). But so too were his priceless Mozart performances
with the Bavarian RS0: the Posthorn Serenade and the Linz and Paris Symphonies. I find this coupling worthwhile but not imperative. Leitner remains undervalued by many critics.  He was anything but a Kapellmeister.

Sensualistic beauty combined with thunderous cascading bass, vocals, guitar solos,harmonicas, (YES! a harmonica in a Boston song? and it captivates!) keeps you always at the edge of expectation which this song DEFINEATELY delivers ! Like a well tuned sports car, the exhaust note wants to make you accelerate past all limits with the comfort of knowing the ride is better and better the faster you go.

1143,"Just a little bit about me, so that you can fully understand why I gave the review of this wonderful ""Meditating With Angels"" CD by Danielle Dove 5 stars.

I am very connected to Nature, and Believe that nature holds the power to heal us if we can connect with it's healing energies. I am also very connected to Angels, and I believe that through meditation, visualization, listening, praying and envoking the Archangels and Guardian Angels, that they can be with us at all times, under all circumstances, and helping us with every aspect of our lives. I believe we can heal Physically and Emotionally by communicating with our angels on a daily basis from a place of love and gratitude.

I Do a lot of Angel Work, Crystal Therapy, Color Therapy, Chakra Clearing and Centering,, meditation, Visualization, Guided Imagery, Yoga etc..and they are all connected. I also spend as much time in Nature as possible, spending time in nature with the living breathing spirit of Mother Earth and her wisdom, with trees, fresh air, flowers, water, sunshine, moon, grass, rock formation etc.. is just another way to reinforce the healing energies that are available to us if we can just tap into them.

I have a lot of Audio CD's of guided meditations, imagery and visualizations that I adore that mostly encorporate Angels and/or nature into them since that is what resonates with me personally.

The reason I am so impressed with Danielle Dove's ""Meditating with Angels"" and gave it 5 stars, is because she encorporated  the aspects of healing with BOTH Angels AND Nature. She manages to sooth and relax you with her beautiful Angelic calming voice, while explaining why nature and Angels are so important to our health and well being, and how they can heal us.  Danielle leads you through beautiful, peaceful meditations focusing on each Chakra,one at a time, to help you Clear and open your Chakras energies for more love, light and healing.

Another thing that I really liked about Danielle's Chakra meditations, is that she does focus on each one seperately for a nice amount of time, yet, they all seamlessly transition into one another. Danielle starts with the Root Chakra, and then as she progresses upward to each additional Chakra, incorporates the new clearing and openess from the previous one you just worked on, into the next one, then those two into the next one, and so forth, so you can really feel how they are not just all seperate energy centers within us, but are in fact all connected on a very fundamental level.

I have heard some CD's where you feel almost 'rushed' to move from one thought to another, or one feeling to another, having to transition and visualize quickly in order to keep up with the speaker... which in my opinion, no matter how good the content is, is not relaxing or effective, because without being able to fully relax and open, you cannot get to the place of inner work you need to get to. I have several CD's that I love the content of, but listen to during the day while working or so forth instead, because they cannot relax me for a meditation sessiion do to the fast pace of the content.
Danielle does a wonderful job of not talking, or 'moving' through her explanations or guided meditations too quickly, thus allowing you time to fully relax, ""sink"" into the comfort of her voice. and become still in mind and body, to be able to focus completely on what she is saying, and visualize it, and literally feel it.

Danielle's CD ""Meditating with Angel's"" also has the most glorious backround water sounds that plays at just the right volume. It doesn't overpower her voice, or distract you from the meditations, however, you can hear it softly in the backround which is just perfect, and adds the extra element of relaxation and connection with nature.

I highly recommend this CD! Thank you Danielle, for a wonderfully enlightening CD that I will treasure as one of the very best in my entire collectiion. I hope to see much more related content from you in the months and years to come!

1168,Wonderful ep.  U2 rules.,1,0.0
1169,"Way back in 1986,  U2 released an album (CD) called; ""Wide Awake in America"". This album arrived in between their two monster releases, ""The Unforgettable Fire"" (1985) & ""The Joshua Tree"" (1987).  Their intent was to give the small independent record shop owners in the USA something unique and limited with which to sell. The record contained 4 songs in all, 2 live and 2 unreleased studio recordings. While interesting, it wasn't anything to write home about. Eventually over time this album (CD) became available everywhere.
I mention this bit of vinyl history because that Irish band that everyone knows and loves is at it again with the latest release, Wide Awake in Europe. This time around U2 is only selling this EP (its not a full album by any stretch of the imagination) to the independent music stores of greater Europe. What is curious with this release is that U2 chose to release it only in vinyl. Seeings how the Compact Disc has been the music media of choice for the past 30 years, I find the band's choice of medium perplexing at best. All songs on the release are ""live"" recordings. Only the first song ""Misery"" is generating much fanfare as U2 has been playing in in concert on the current European leg of their tour. The 3 other songs are of unknown quality in terms of popularity. I say this because with these other unknown songs its pot luck at best, meaning they may be great or far from it. Only you will be able to decide which after listening to them.
In conclusion, unless you count yourself as a U2 ""completeist"", then you might want to skip this album at least for the time being. One song does not a record purchase make. So unless you're able to pick this up at or near the original asking price, I'd pass on this. This is the reason behind the rather high priced gouging  your experiencing here on Amazon & elsewhere on the web. This album is ONLY being sold in Europe and ONLY to independent record sellers that sell records, no ""big box stores"".  If history serves as any indicator, within the next several years or so U2's ""Wide Awake in Europe"" will eventually and quietly find its way on to CD at a more reasonable price to boot.

1175,"OK, everybody knows the deal with Charlie Hunter.  He plays either a 7 or 8 string custom guitar (mostly 7 these days) with some bass strings and some regular guitar strings, and fanned frets.  The set-up allows him to play the bass line and the guitar line simultaneously like some freak of nature.  Usually, though, he plays with a band and if you didn't know what was going on, you wouldn't realize that the guitarist and the bassist are the same guy, playing without overdubs.  On Public Domain, he plays unaccompanied, so there is nobody else to distract from the shear genius of his instrumental work.  The title of the album refers to the contents-- all of the tracks are old pieces that exist in the ""public domain,"" meaning that nobody holds the copyrights, so anyone can record them.  If you are a fan of traditional blues, jazz and folk, you will know most of the songs.  The cool thing is, though, that if you don't look at the track list, you will still have to think hard about what some of the songs are while listening to them because Hunter updates and personalizes the pieces so well.  The mood is fun, and the guitar work is as good as anything Hunter has ever recorded.  If you are looking for the more funk-influenced stuff he has done lately on albums like Mistico and Copperopolis, you won't find as much of that here.  This is more like his Duo album with Leon Parker, both in the stripped-down nature and the more straight jazz aesthetic.  Hunter is channeling his Joe Pass/Lenny Breau influences more than his John Scofield influences.  I wish Hunter would record more like this.  His only other unaccompanied album (Solo Eight-String Guitar) isn't exactly a widely available cd.  That puts Public Domain up there with the Leon Parker Duo album as one of my favorite Hunter recordings.

Further listening: Phil DeGruy.  DeGruy plays a 17-string guitar.  No, that's not a typo.  He plays unaccompanied, and frequently records wildly re-imagined old gems, kind of like Hunter does on this album.",1,1.0

1342,"""Take Your Time (Do It Right)"" became SOS Band's biggest hit prior to this album and they wouldn't score another big hit single until 1983, which means that R&B fans have overlooked the marvelous work that was done on the band's 1982 release. This album was not Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis' first produced work (Klymaxx's Girls Will Be Girls album came out several months earlier was their first) because they didn't have a hand in producing any tracks on III, however they did write ""High Hopes"" for the band of which is the duo's first song under their name that was a hit single (#25 R&B hit in early 1983). That song solidified them as cutting their teeth with producing for the band as them being the most in demand producers in the music business within the next 3 decades to come.  All the songs was produced by Sylvers' member, Ricky Sylvers (Leon Sylvers' younger brother) and veteran songwriter, Gene Dozier, explaining why the album sounds a little bit like a Shalamar album, but with major differences with how the instrumental arrangements was made (in which in part were done by Leon Sylvers himself). ""High Hopes,"" ""Good & Plenty,"" ""You Shake Me Up,"" and ""Have It Your Way"" were outstanding examples on why the album should have gotten the recognition it was deprived of. ""Looking For You"" was a bouncy track yet funkier version of ""Take Your Time."" Although this wasn't the best SOS Band album (in my opinion); it was the best before they reached superstardom when black music made a major shift in 1982-83. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis would be the near exclusive producers for SOS Band by the next album, thus changing the sound and standards of black music with the heavy use of the 808 drum machines and synthesizers of which would also make them stars overseas as well. That is why I call this album the best before their best.",1,1.0

Since the MP3 standard requires a (very brief) moment of silence at the beginning and end of every song, joining the eight songs requires a lot of manual work.

Sadly, you do not get as many tracks for your money that way, but quality is something the record labels could care less about these days.

1359,"Like so many other MP3 collections recently issued by K-Tel, this one is populated almost entirely by remakes. This is particularly egregious in the case of ""one hit wonders,"" as the artist's one brief moment of fame is hidden from unsuspecting listeners by these soundalikes. In a few cases, such as the Spiral Starecase's ""More Today Than Yesterday,"" truth in advertising wins out by relabeling the artist ""Pat Upton Formerly of Spiral Starecase,"" but for most of the cuts the artist is listed by their original name, and no notation is made that these are modern re-recordings. As with all such compilations, some of the new versions are truer to the originals than others; a few may even be the originals, but without clearer documentation, it's hard to know what's what.

The version of ""Liar, Liar"" that opens the set sounds like the original, in wide stereo, and Ian Whitcomb's ""You Turn Me On"" also sounds like the real deal. But it's quickly downhill from there. ""Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah"" doesn't approach the grandiosity of the Phil Spector-produced Wall of Sound, and ""Incense and Peppermints"" sounds more like a MIDI-arrangement with worn vocals than a psych-pop masterpiece. ""Rhythm of the Rain"" is sung as a folk song rather than latter-day doo-wop, and it's missing the signature celeste; several other tracks, despite good performances and solid vocals, shade the tempos a hair fast or slow, and have modern production that's too clean to reproduce the feel of the hit singles.

No doubt many of these recreations offer artists a chance to reconnect with royalties signed away in a flush of youthful innocence; they also offer die-hard fans an opportunity to hear an alternate to the well-known hits.

1374,"This is the 1950 Furtwangler/La Scala RING with Flagstad in a new remastering.  The sound is spectacular and we now have a new remastering that truly reveals the genius of Furtwangler in all its myriad orchestral colors.  The sound stage for both singers and orchestra is unprecedented for this 1950 Historic RING.  Never before have we heard such clear orchestra detail in such well balanced clean sound between the singers and pit.  Any other mastering of this RING, including Gebhardt, is left in the so called ""starting gate"" to use a horse race term.  It is truly SPECTACULAR!  It's as if, like AUDITE with their RIAS new radio master tapes of both Furtwangler and now Knappertsbusch live concerts of the 50's ARCHIPEL has been given new first generation excellent radio broadcast tapes; and with many of these broadcasts now being legal to distribute (public domain), that could be the case.  Whatever the case, this new transfer or remastering is a huge audio advance.  I don't need to repeat all the raves about this historic performance; except to say, NOW IT SONICALLY LIVES UP TO ITS REPUTATION.  The sound is now almost like excellent studio MONO of the first tier.  Furtwangler is the true star of this RING. You hear things in the orchestra that no other conductor finds; yet, everything seems so natural and just right.  All the motives are so clear and all the climaxes just overwhelming.  Flagstad is magnificent.  Lorenz is great just at the end of a great career.  HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1,0.0

1391,"Actually John O'Banion's best album is the Japanese release ""Close Up"" which is an excellent example of how sometimes less is more.  That album had a different arrangement of some of the tracks listed on this album and some of the tracks here are not on that album and yet it still had a very nice flow and sounded a much more cohesive and hence much more enjoyable to listen to album.  Until we get a similar release of that album then ""Danger"" will hold the mantle as The Great Voice's best album.

My introduction to The Great Voice was years ago as a child watching a program on tv called ""Solid Gold"" which was a big hit at the time. I was blown away when this unassuming chap came on and belted out in an unbelievable display of vocal range, tone and powerful delivery an extremely well written song called ""Love You Like I Never Loved Before."" I just loved the way the song combined powerful rock power chords with tender balladic lyrics which wasn't very common at the time but which was quickly imitated ever since. I remember ever since that night I spent many days trying to find that track somewhere on cassette but with no success. I finally found it on a bootleg copy of a various hits compilation (there were many of these in those days).  What my brother managed to find in the meantime though was an original, legal version of ""Close-Up"" or the Japanese version of ""Danger"" on cassette which between ourselves we listened to until all the oxide fell off the tape.  It was just that enjoyable an album and although ""Danger"" is no ""Close-Up"" I guess it'll have to do until we also get a mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version of ""Close-Up"" too.

Pleasant results usually follow the collaboration of great songwriters and great singers and we get no exception here. The Joey Carbone/Richie Zito/Kathi Pinto partnership on one side and The Great Voice on the other has resulted in a very strong release of love song crooning in one of its better incarnations.  Unlike the debut album which had one cover all the tracks here are originals.  There are many standout tracks here that show a vast improvement over the debut album release.  Tracks like my favourite ""Our Love"", ""I'm The One"", ""Deep In the Night"", ""I Don't Want To Love Your Love"", ""Through the Eyes of Love"", ""Take Me Back"" and the bonus track ""Inside This Heart of Mine"" are just very well written songs and the other 3 bonus tracks of live material add to the overall enjoyment of the main course.

The mlps release itself is not much to shout about not being one of the better designs and assembly that I have ever seen but the sound quality is very good. Also included is a foldout containing all the lyrics in English.

1433,"Vivacity, warmth and lyricism will take you a long way in Mozart - a long, long way - but not to the end of the line. That's the terminal of artists who contest his kerygma in their marrow.

For all her merits - and dammit, I enjoy this venture - Annerose Schmidtt (ARS) is not in that class. She's too Via Media for her own good. Ornamentation is feeble and contrived. More rubato would go astray - why be so literal and so often at that? Metaphysics is a rarity in this cycle - and ever so worryingly, one could extend this comment to introspection per se. Nevertheless, ARS is so much fun, if you're prepared to accept her limitations (and the not uncommon let's-sight-read-the-score moments from Uncle Kurt Masur on the podium), this survey from the mid-Seventies is compulsive. The full-blooded symphonic contribution of the Dresden Philharmonic is reparatory.

K 175 - The Pocket Rocket derives much of its mojo from timpani. Here it is obscured by the (silky) strings. In summary, this is a thumper in its outer movements whereas the Andante is unimaginative. This is Three Stars at best.

K 238 - This is a well-proportioned reading. Nevertheless, the slow movement is under-characterised - and who would have thought that such a thing was possible? This is a Three Stars job.

K 246 - This is how to play the Ltnow! Indeed, it's the most symphonic version I've ever heard. While the slow movement could be more reflective, it does not detract from the wider affair. This is Five Stars easily. Great stuff!

K 271 - This is the first real test (as some would say). Again, the recording is superb even if the piano prevails over the orchestra. The first movement is vibrancy itself but not much more than that (the same comment is applicable of the finale). While it might appeal to the Taliban, the slow movement is too fast and unreflective for my liking. This is Three Stars where the recording is solid analogue and nothing more.

K 413 - Big bold and brassy - this is a performance of the F major Concerto like none other. It's almost a sinfonia concertante. That being said, the poetic elements are not lost. Five Stars in a canter. Great recording too

K 414 - This masterpiece is played with ardour and delight with a piano-centric recording to match. I cannot fault this. What expectancy is on offer in the slow movement! How the orchestra sings in its prelude! It's enough to melt the sun. This could be the highlight of the set. Five Stars!

K 415 - Oh for a more prominent timpani and brass - but man, everyone is betting the house here so who cares? Five Stars for sure!

K 449 - Here is another massive test. Some - yours truly included - regard it as Mozart's greatest piano concerto. The Dresden Philharmonic offers a symphonic and yet-lithe-on-its-feet contribution. ARS could be more insightful but she's still great fun. This is Four Stars and enjoyable enough.

K 450 - Lively, vivacious and perceptive, what's there not to love? What a graceful opening to the Andante! Again, a virile bass-line underwrites this venture. This is a Five Stars job.

K 451 - Again, timpani could be more prominent. Nevertheless, this unproblematic work is aligned with ARS's skill-set and she does not fail. Five Stars!

K 453 - This is another Olympian test. To a certain extent, the vivacity of the music-making masks the lack of interpretative depth (for instance, the episode-in-the-minor of the Andante is feigned). This is a solid Three Stars job. There are no complaints re the recording.

K 456 - This side of the Pearly Gates, no-one owns this concerto. Anda comes damn close. Again, I cannot fault the outer movements - and I adore the beefy involvement of the Dresden Philharmonic. The slow movement, played literally, is not the last word in tragedy. This is a Three Stars job even if it held my attention. The recording is OK.

K 459 - Again, I love the symphonic opening with strong bass line - and much the same could be said of the finale wherein double basses and cellos bestride like colossi. This arrangement is not to the detriment of woodwind. The opening of the slow movement could be more nuanced (blame Big Kurt as ARS seems to follow his literalism). This is a Four Stars recommendation (just), underwritten by a fine recording.

K 466 - Notwithstanding its musicality, there's no sense of menace here. ARS is far too literal. The Romance is on the fast side. Three Stars and I`m being generous.

K 467 - I can appreciate Mozart as Bruckner - that's what we get in the opening prelude of the first movement from the strings which are vividly recorded - but reportedly there's a timpani and brass in the score and one would like to hear them in this masterpiece.  The slow movement is enjoyable at its breezy pace. This is a solid, musical Three Stars job. Its outer movements in particular held my attention.

K 482 - this performance is Plain Jane on a bad hair-day with zits. Come the big moments, nothing further eventuates - this could have been the genesis of Masur's reputation as a serial-deflator of tyres. The soloist does little to deepen the affair; the Greek Tragedy of the Andante is more like a satyr play. One Star is warranted.

K 488 - the mojo is back in the outer movements which are great fun. Notwithstanding ARS's musicality, the Adagio is devoid of tragedy. This is a Three Star recommendation, underwritten by a fine recording.

K 491 - a great recording and full blooded orchestral response are not going to redeem this semi-tough reckoning with the kerygma of the C Minor Concerto where Uncle Kurt sight-read the score on the day. Being devoid of introspection, this is a Two Stars job.

K 503 - From the perspective of strings and woodwind, this is a great recording even if the poor timpanist down the back gets little airtime. If the symphonic response of the Dresden Philharmonic was ever going to resonate, it would be in K 503 - and it does so imperiously. ARS is a delight. Five stars all the way.

K 537 - This performance features a great recording - for strings. Calling all timpani and brass - can you please make your way to the microphone! Enjoyable as this is, this performance accepts the Coronation's gallant credentials at face-value and does little with them; experience tells us that there's greater richness to be mined. Three Stars at best!

K 595, as I undertook this survey, I became more and more worried for K 595 as it approached: at their worst, ARS and Big Kurt can be as brainless as headless chickens.  While I love the recording and symphonic response of the Dresden Philharmonic, this K 595 is as elegiac as a McHappy Meal. A solitary star is warranted.

To summarise, this is a middling endeavour. It has a place in the scheme of things. I can understand the viewpoint of the five-star reviewers: one cannot impugn its baseline musicality even if operates in a restricted sphere and its longevity is open to debate. This is damming in its own way, but if you're about to undertake an exacting road-trip, buddy up ARS and Uncle Kurt.

1440,"As Jennifer blasted it out, it truly is a new dawn and a new light for this song.  Jennifer adds a sass to this song that prior versions do not seem to have.  If you take Michael Bubl's version for instance, it has a great rat pack sort of feel to it.  His voice is all honey but it feels like we have heard it before.  Yet again if we do another comparison with a version like Nina Simone's, her version was sultry and bluesy.  But compared to these great renditions, the song has a whole new set of legs to it thanks to Jennifer.

Within the song whenever Jennifer's voice rises up, she still maintains composure and gives the track a flawless clean feel.  Even the instrumental in the background seems to take this same approach too.  I feel we can say at last that this millennium finally possesses the definitive version of this song.  Its amazing to see the kind of evolution it has gone through, and I can certainly say that Jennifer helped make it possible.  Bravo!",1,1.0

1500,"""Black Crow Blue,"" the title track from Nathan Bell's most recent album on Stone Barn Records, opens with the question: ""Have you ever seen a sky so wide/That you could fit the whole world inside. I have."" He then inquires, ""Baby, can you see me now?"" Here in this tender ballad, inspired by writer Glen Hirshberg's Book of Bunk, Nathan displays his sensitive and attuned eye for poetic metaphors that are sparse yet accurate descriptors of love, hardship, and what is, at times, the inexplicable journey we're all on in our lives.

He captures what it means to be alone and, particularly, what it means to put love at the forefront of anything else that we think matters.

It is in this, with Nathan's sharp gaze at life, that his songs illuminate how we all are taken in and either worn smooth or left ragged by this journey. Nathan credits much of his inspiration for songs from the works of well-established writers: Hirshberg, Sebastian Matthews, and his father: poet, Marvin Bell, amongst others.
Yet, his songs stand as unique creative works in their own right as well. One doesn't need to know all of the literary references to still get his music.

In ""American Crow,"" Nathan describes his character Crow as a man who never stays put, symbolized by "" . . . tattooed wings beneath [his] skin."" In this opening line, I hear echoes of the ""Crow's"" who have passed through my life. I acknowledge my own impulse to take flight at various junctures. When he sings, ""Black feathers/Hollow bones/Nowhere left/For the light to go/ Sitting on a fence post at the side of the road, American Crow,"" I'm reminded of Paul D in Toni Morrison's Beloved who "" . . . didn't believe he could live with a woman---any woman---for over two out of three months. That was as long as he could abide in one place.""  I suspect that Crow, like Paul D, leaves because it's the only way he feels free, and it's a liberation that dodges heartache.

Nathan's songs lay bare the inclination to wrap ourselves in deceits so that we might avoid facing our own mortality and flaws. In ""Me and Larry,"" Nathan reminisces on his connection with the late-writer, Larry Brown. He sings, ""Somehow always in the end/We become the tales we tell.""  Later, he reflects, ""It was twenty years ago my friend/When I thought that we weren't mortal men.""  He traces the trajectory of believing in time eternal just where it fades as we approach middle age, an age when we begin to experience the loss of others, once young with us.

Black Crow Blue, however, isn't a bleak album.

Yes, Nathan writes about tough times, exploitation, and unfair treatment. But he never neglects the thread of love or shard of hope that holds us together. We hear this in ""A Stone's Throw"" when he sings of a man barely getting by, reeling from a bad economy and poverty. While others want to turn their heads in shame, the singer tells us, ""But I look them in the eyes/Say man, it's me, don't you realize/We're all we've got if we're going to survive."" Ultimately, the song stresses that type of survival: through community, even in the face of unjustness.

(A notable mention here: ""Stone's Throw Away"" was picked up by singer Lizanne Knott for her upcoming 2013 release Standing in the English Rain. She does a kick-ass rendition and arrangement, worthy of checking out.)

On the album's closing track, ""We All Get Gone,"" Nathan digs into a strict blues groove, his wailing harmonica getting as much play time as his vocals.  He moans, "" . . . I'm just traveling/Watch me traveling away/Cause get it right or get wrong, sooner or later/We all get gone."" Despite the resolute attitude of the singer, Nathan conveys a candor that is welcoming and intimate. I'm feeling as though I'm sitting at a coffeehouse table one dusky evening while Nathan strums, picks, toots his harmonica, and lights up the stage with his voice.

Throughout Black Crow Blue, Nathan's vocals, measured and at times with a grittiness reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen, deliver the lyrics with clear-headed certainty of the stories he tells. His descriptive guitar playing, forceful when necessary, provides the clean well-structured melodies that turn his poems to song. In Nathan's writing are songs that encourage the listeners to claim the poetry of our own lives and to find the songs in others'. It's a good way to think about being in this world.",1,0.0

May the mind of Christ my Savior
Live in me from day to day,
By His love and pow'r controlling all I do and say.

So when I was back home I searched for a CD with this hymn and came across ""Everything Is Sacred.""

I have never found the original recording on cassette or cd (I borrowed the lps from Library and recorded them onto cassette, but this recording by Gerard Plunkett is very good indeed, and it tells, as dramatic performance, the Life and Works of Oscar Wilde.  Wilde is, perhaps, better known today for the story of his life, and there are many fine biographies that tell the tale, as does Peter Ackroyd's debut novel of 1983, THE LAST TESTAMENT OF OSCAR WILDE.  Fascinating as Oscar's life is, it is good to see that his writings are now being taken seriously as works of literary worth (especially with the beautiful hardcover editions from Oxford University Press).  This recording pays as much attention to the writings of Wilde as it does with the story of his life, and the readings from poems, stories, plays and epistles are delightfully performed.

1602,"In many ways I tend to view Klaus Doldinger in a similar way that I do Miles Davis. During his years with the fusion rhythm section Passport Klaus not only played saxaphone and composed all of the music but he also played the other melodic instruments as well such as the electric piano and meletron. Associated with the European music scene to such a degree they never got the type of international audience they probably deserved,Passport began their fifth album on the note of their creatively defining&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hand-Made/dp/B001DJ7QC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hand Made</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Looking-Thru/dp/B00005RZX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Looking Thru</a>&nbsp;albums. The majority of those recordings were journeys to find what they came across here. A lot of people who have managed to discover Passport's wonderful and imaginative type of electric jazz  often describe this as their finest album. Don't know how I feel about that. But I can certainly see why someone might think so.

  For one this album embodies just about all the qualities that make Passport special. There's the dreamy and often abstract nature of the arrangements in these compositions. Also the instrumental choices. The title song is the first example. Clocking in at over thirteen minutes it's an exciting journey from progressive rock type theatrics,into blues and than out and out funk. When Klaus comes in on sax,the sound he produces is rather soft and melodic compared to the phased electric keyboards,synthesizers providing the harmony. It's a beautiful contrast of melody and rhythm. ""Homunculus"" is very rhythmically flamboyant but again never loses that center of instrumental control either. ""Jadoo"" and ""Will-O-Whisp"" on the other hand,perhaps anticipating Doldinger's interest in film scores provide us with blacksploitation influence cinematic funk with a heavy dance orientation as well.

  ""Albatross Song"",with it's breezier rhythm and the spare ballad ""Damals"" showcase the band itself playing in a somewhat more understated manner more in the league of how Klaus himself is playing here. Doldinger is a very moody player/composer. Capble of being brooding and low key one moment and flamboyant to the point of being highly aggressive the next.  The rhythm section of keyboardist Kristian Schultze,bassist/guitarist Wolfgang Schmid and drummer Curt Cress are perfectly attuned to these shifting musical passions he tends to have. Even though they are European and tend to be localized in that area of the world,I still have trouble understanding why their sound never caught on. Maybe it was more that electric jazz/fusion/funk-jazz anywhere had a bit of trouble catching in,on many levels. On the other hand if one is interested in this type of music this definitely stands as an important part of that genre as well as being a strong and important release for Passport as a group.",1,0.0

And on a more personal note a man who treated me as an equal, and as a woman, someone with intelligence. He was a fine mentor.
So I learned a lot about music and songs putting folios together, and if you google me, you will find my name lised alongside others for various music folios.
Album starts off with Dave's speaking about joining the 1957 The Greyhound Bus Tour (60 days) and he finds himself sitting with Chuck Berry. The opening track is a Chuck Berry Medley.  And Dave does them justice.
As he does with all the other great songs he recorded including Summetime Blues, The Everyly Brothers' medley, Buddy Holly medley, The Drifters, a conversation with Buddy Holly, Fats Domino and other stars also on the bus.
Dave adds dialogue throughout the album and it's interesting to share in the history of a remarkable tour, with so many stars on a bus together.
If you want a history lesson of a time in music when much changed, this is an album you should have in your collection.

It's just pathetic.

Really trite, predictable stuff. Plus the titles are terrible. Who names a song Ape School? I guess it's all subjective though.

After some research, I found out that it is indeed Christopher on vocals, but the ones performing the music has no ties with the band, Stabbing Westward. I even contacted Cleopatra Records, who informed me that it is Chris but not the remaining members.

I'm sorry I purchased just the one song. The worst song purchase I have ever made.

Cleopatra Records has a history of releasing stuff like this. They just recently released a ""Trapt"" album titled ""Headstrong."" Again, the vocalist, but doesn't sound like the band.

problems, the reason is usually that the material is pretty thin. Indeed, there are about 5-6 songs worth listening to on the three albums combined, and none of them come close to Hudson and Ford's compositions on the Strawbs' 'Bursting' and 'Grave

What would be an absolutely wonderful thing for this label to do is the first performance of Sheherazade by the conductor Issay Dobrowen.  It is 58 minutes of unmatcheable interpretation including a 20 minute second movement which because of its total spontaniety doesn't sound slow at all.  In fact its the best movement of a fabulously natural performance.  What EMI reissued a couple of years ago is the more politically correct 47 minute performance which still is very good indeed.  But, if you want the ultimate by a conductor steeped in this music . . . . . . . ?

And then, there are the Glazounov 2nd, 3rd and 5th symphonies conducted by the vastly underrated Boris Khaikin.  the 2nd and 3rd, for sure, are superior to anything done since. Released in the 70s by EMI records in excellent stereo.

And for more, the first recordings ever of the Prokofiev 2nd and 3rd symphonies with Charles Bruck conducting a razor edged French Orchestra seemingly made to order for this overwhelmingly powerful music which has since been tamed by many conductors but never presented as excitingly as this! A French Columbia recording c1960.

1793,"Having attempted to listen to this CD twice, I wish I could say something positive about this CD. Thirty years ago I first heard this recreation on an LP by Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra. That was a tour-de-force! This effort is decidedly 2nd class. The orchestra certainly tries hard, but is not up to the challenge. The recording itself sounds like something that came out of Russian during the 60's. It's very tinny and closely miked. As for the conductor, it's either Alberto Lizzio or Alfred Scholtz (Both are shown on different labels of the same work).

If you want to hear this unique work, the recording of it by Neeme Jarvi and the London Philharmonic is fairly rewarding. That recording, on the Chandos label, is coupled with Tchaikovsky's 3rd piano concerto. But, for my money, try to find the LP of Ormandy and the Philadelphians.",0,0.0

The playing is impeccable, and it is really a matter of opinion whether you consider this or Dennis Russell Davies' version definitive. It is a little faster paced in spots, and a little more clean, but the Davies version is interpreted differently. As for the Copland Organ Symphony, there is no doubt about it.

In ""I pini di Villa Borghese"" many notes in the famous horn part were either inaudible or omitted. It just plain doesn't sound right. The recording also ended on a bad note, with a trumpet hanging over on the final release of ""I pini della Via Appia"".

The suggestive script is split onto the 2nd and 3rd tracks.

The title track is the cover of a Bert Kaempfert composition from 1966.

1918,"Many have written here that this is not the best collection of Bruce Cockburn's work. I'm not a mind reader or a seer, so I'm thinking those are evaluations made by people who have always had easy access to his recorded music. I, and I'd guess many others, have not had that easy access. My work life has always kept me in places where his music was not available. I don't have all of Mr Cockburn's albums in my collection. So, what does this all mean? Simply that I am absolutely satisfied with this collection of Bruce Cockburn's music. There are many songs in this collection that I've never heard. They are as good as all the music I've become familiar with in years previous. If you're a person who has collected most, if not all, of Mr Cockburn's music, you may be disappointed with this anthology. If you're someone like me, without that all encompassing collection, I'll bet that you'd enjoy this compilation immensely. I'll be listening to this one until it's no longer playable.

1920,"Five stars for the music.  One star for the absence of consideration to avid fans that went into this box set.  There are many rarities that are still ""out there"" that could have been included, and which would have brought something fresh to this collection. Instead, you get 6 CD's of music that has been available for years on the official releases; one disc of ""rarities"", although many of these supposed rarities are available on other compilations that are readily available; and a single DVD of an acoustic tour that Bruce did a few years ago.  Talk about a missed opportunity!  How difficult would it have been to include missing B sides that never made it to CD?  Or rarities that are only available on hard-to-find and out-of-print CD's?  And why not include a DVD of the movie ""Rumours of Glory"" that came out in the 80's, or any number of other live performances that would have made fantastic DVD's?  Bruce is a significant artist with some very devoted fans.  They deserve more than this wasted opportunity to produce a meaningful box set.  Thumbs up for the music.  Thumbs down for the absence of imagination that went into this once in a career box set.

NOTE: After receiving in the mail the AMAZING Wilco box set that was just released this week, I have had to lower my review of Bruce's box set.  Wilco shows what it is like to approach fans with imagination and integrity.  Bruce's team rather shrewdly was able to convince a fan like me to spend over $100 for a single CD of music of ""rarities"" -- many of which I already own -- and a DVD.  They didn't do a fraction of the work that Wilco's team did.  Wilco's box set is NOTHING BUT RARITIES.  It is amazing.  Bruce's songs and guitar playing and voice are also amazing, but his team has put together a box set that is not worth the support of fans who deserve more.",0,1.0

1922,"This being an import I am assuming it's either going to be the German or the French 12"". Either way the tracks are all identical to the U.S. release. There is nothing worth getting on this 12"" vinyl you can't get on the original album unless you are a remix freak. Trust me. The remix (or dance version) isn't worth it. You get three tracks:

- Owner Of A Lonely Heart (Special ""Red & Blue"" Remix Dance Version)

This is considered a very rare track, but it's a mess. It's has a strong vibe on it similar to Dazz Band's Let it Whip along with various pacing breaks, sample clips (including a popular Art of Noise voice sample), and other distractions put in between normal spots of the song. It's an irritating club mix that runs a little over seven minutes.

- Owner Of A Lonely Heart (Edited Version)

Just a single mix of the album version. It's about a minute shorter than the album version and feels a bit stunted because of it. Although I admit it does hit all the important marks, but you miss some cool instrumentation.

- Our Song

This is the exact same version as what's found on the 90125 album.

1929,"A homage is a tribute a fan pays to a certain person or thing in respects to the original work without profiteering from the work. It is free. It is available to all. And it is easily accessible. Even Voices of the Lifestream is free. This is not free. This is a fallacy. It should be reported to Square-Enix and to Uematsu for Copyright infringment.

Beyond that, lets look at this from a Musical Critic's perspective:

It doesn't even seem like it took these guys longer than a day to make this. All the songs' raps sound exactly the same. Just listen to the demo. They didn't even remix the background songs they used to rap over. It's laughable really. It's like a few guys in their basement using a re-mixing program to produce, well, crap.

This is isn't rapping. It's crapping. And I am not saying that to get on anyone's nerves. It's true. It's easily ascertainable. ""Oh man, so many tribute albums, this is the best one!"" No. It's not. Not even for the Rap genre. But what bothers me the most is that the people who made this had the audacity to put up for sale on Amazon. It's not worth 9 dollars. No tribute is. No homage is. Why? Because the true fan doesn't wish to see a profit from their fandom. They do it as fans.

And these fans aren't good rappers. And I know good rap. I enjoy rap. So Final Fantasy/Rap lovers, understand I am judging this based on my opinion of rap. This is just... bad. Hell, Will Smith can make better raps than this.

By stripping out the distortion on the vocals, Grendel reveals not only a puny, strangulated, wanna-be tough/emo voice, but also lyrics that are so childish and silly, I was embarrassed to be listening.  Even worse, the songs consist of nothing but choruses- the same three lines repeated over and over, and then the choruses themselves are repeated over and over.  In other words, each song has about three lines, total, each of which is repeated three times within a chorus, and the chorus is repeated about six times within the song...and lines themselves are utterly cheesy and stupid.

Furthermore, this idiot has done what so many other Goth/Industrial losers have-- given his girlfriend way too much space on the album-- her monotone ""robo-girl"" interjections are particularly annoying.

I suspected that Grendel's last album, Harsh Generation, was a little too cheesy and commercialized, but I chose to ignore those aspects.  Unfortunately, every silly and ridiculous aspect of Harsh Generation has only been enhanced and expanded upon with this new single.  This release is just pure garbage that is a disgrace to the genre.

Road Ratt's sound is kin to what the Electric Boys were doing at the time. Some people call this funk rock, but there really aren't too many traces of funk on this record in my own opinion. The production is typical Swedish, with over-the-top sounds and choruses, and the songs are just as catchy as ever. How the Swedes continue to pump out such quality hard rock, even till this day, is far beyond me. While I wouldn't call this essential, or even five-star, it does have some really cool melodic rock songs. I liked ""Use The Lighter,"" ""Ragman City,"" ""Beggars Day"" and ""Turn Me On;"" the rest was decent, but there was also some filler that crept in as well.

If nothing else, its eccentric rock the sort of rock with impeccable style, that wears a fedora, bursts unexpectedly through the haze of a smoky club and sways its hips with a swinging, boozy groove, sometimes foul-mouthed but always charming.  It both compliments and intrudes upon your melancholy thoughts with gratifying irreverence.

The lyrics can be absurd and surreal--but even at their extremes, they are too poetic to be entirely gratuitous.  They are dream-like, driving in pace along with the music, and you could just enjoy the sound of them and the clever turns of phrase, if you like.  But if you really listen you might get the sense that youve fallen down a rabbit hole of some punkish film noir series, with mysterious characters and strange story-telling.  The lead singers voice is both wild and precise, with such a daring stylistic range that you nearly imagine it to be more than one person.

For a debut album this is an incredible offering -- every song is solid and the album is tight in production and coherent in tone.  Excellent guitar, bass, drums along with whimsical piano riffs, the occasional horn, and various effects that all add to the mood at just the right times.  It would be impossible to pick one favorite or standout among so many strong tracks.  Not a single weak song to be skipped.  In fact, its still, many years after its initial release, one of my all-time favorite albums to play all the way through.  Its darkly theatrical and a lot of fun to move to.

To sum up... Holy sh** this band is awesome!  Buy this album and you will have a hidden gem of musical mischief with which to while away the dull hours and impress your friends with!  The Spider Hole stands alone -- there is no other band quite like them.

2040,"In the heyday of the so-called ""Garage Bands"" one emerged from Lansing, Michigan to make a minor dent on the Billboard Pop Hot 100 in March 1967 with a surprisingly good rendition of the Bo Diddley-penned (in 1956) Who Do You Love? Led by vocalist Stormy Rice, the other members were harpist/keyboardist ""Boogie"" Bob Baldori, guitarist Jeff Baldori, bassist Ron English and drummer Bee Metros, their first time on record was 1965's Black Crow Blues b/w Morning Dew as TTP-156 which quickly went nowhere.

Late in 1966 they got Dunhill/ABC sufficiently interested to release Who Do You Love? b/w Hey Girl as Dunhill/ABC 4052 and by the following March they had made their one minor mark on U.S. Pop single history. However, when the follow-up Duncan And Brady b/w Love Words bombed as Dunhill/ABC 4088 later in 1967 they were dropped. Hits collectors can find a decent copy of their lone charting side in the CD Michigan Nuggets but I have never run across the B-side in any such compilation, so at the moment completist collectors will have to settle for a good vinyl source such the 45-rpm covered here.

Despite their lack of commercial success, the talents displayed by the band were recognized by no less than two R&R legends (and Hall of Fame inductees) Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley and starting in 1967 they often appeared as the back-up band for both artists (in fact, Berry's 1970 album Back Home features their contributions). Sometime in 1968 Rice embarked upon a solo career with his replacement being multiple instrumentalist Zocko Groendahl.

In 1970 they released the album ""Basic Rock"" at Bob Baldori's Spirit Records containing: A1. Who Do You Love?; A2. Two Way Wishin'; A3. Let's Not Use Each Other; A4. Bye Bye Johnny; A5. San Francisco Bay Blues; A6. Hear The Music; B1. You're My Angel; B2. Back For More; B3. Vandegraff's Blues; B4. Truckin'; B5. Wish You Would. From the LP emerged the 1970 singles Vandergraf's Blues (or I Get A Charge Out Of You) b/w Vandergraf's Blahs as Spirit 0007 and Back For More b/w the non-LP side Super Ball - label number not clear. Two years later they compiled their second album, ""Live At Lizard's"" - recorded at Lizard's in East Lansing - containing: A1. Shake The Boogie (3:38); A2. Stormy Monday (4:38); A3. Berry Medley (6:42); A4. Mojo (9:14); B1. Dust My Blues (3:44); B2. I Wanna Boogie (9:10); B3. Hot Tamales (1:46); B4. Comin' Round The Mountain (1:39); B5. Bye Bye Boogie (10:00).

A CD collection of their music recorded from 1965 to 1975 has been produced by Bob Baldori titled Ride, Ride, Ride containing: 1. Super Ball (3.16); 2. Ride Ride Ride (3.06); 3. Black Crow Blues (1.41); 4. Love Words (2.47); 5. Bring It With You When You Come (1.57); 6. Morning Dew (2.45); 7. Chuck's Chunk (2.17); 8. Who Do You Love? (2.02); 9. Feelin' Good (3.01); 10. Can't Get Stuff (3.28); 11. Hootchie Cootchie Man Is Back (2.44); 12. Back for More (2.45); 13. Duncan And Brady (2.24); Vandegraf's Blues (2.54); 15. Two Way Wishin' (2.24); 16.

2051,"Sure, there is a recognizable theme from the second movement of the Pathetique, and it explains another reviewer's reaction: ""who ripped this off Beethoven?""

In fact, that's the proper way to describe this make-believe 10th. Cooper took themes (mostly incomplete themes) belonging Beethoven, and he wrote a piece that's not in any recognizable Beethoven style. He wrote it in the style of Schumann, Mendelssohn and, mildly in places of counterpoint, Brahms.

It contains more melodies crammed together than Beethoven incorporates in his symphonies. The ketches used in this symphony were written during different times in Beethoven's life and they may well have been intended for uses other than a 10th symphony. They were pasted together with crazy glue.

Cooper's Symphony #10 is no more than a piece of conversation.

I doubt you'll want to listen to it more than 2 or 3 times, out of curiosity for cooper's understanding of Beethoven. Cooper may be a scholar who has studied how Beethoven wrote music. He may cognitively understand Beethoven's method of composition, but Beethoven has not penetrated his creative heart.",0,0.0

2068,"Of the many shelved Death Row-associated projects, this one represents probably the most regrettable what-if, how-much-of-a-classic-it-would-have-been-had-it-been-released-on-time, situation,

Rap groups tend to behave a bit like radioactive nuclei, i.e., they have a decay half-life. It's quite short and it's especially brief when they are put together sort of randomly and loosely as a promotion vehicle for their members, which was the case with the LBC Crew. This album was recorded around 1995, but it had to wait for Dogg Food to come out first, as Daz and Kurupt had already been introduced on previous Death Row releases and it was their turn to put out an album. But Dogg Food was delayed for legal reasons and only came out in late 1995, just when 2Pac came in and instantly became the massive star around which everything in the label gravitated. Meanwhile there were issues with how exactly the album was to be released. Bottom line, they were given enough time to fall out with each other, and they duly did it, right around the time when the label itself began falling apart too.

And the album never came out, which is real shame.

There are a couple forgettable tracks, but overall this is at least on the same level as Dogg Food, and it should have ranked right there with it and other Death Row releases in the pantheon of G-Funk classics. Unfortunately, at this point in time it's not really possible to appreciate how good the album is as after it got shelved, several of the tracks were reused for other projects and much of the rest leaked on the internet. So few people will be hearing all of it for the first time. And that's also a shame because the tracks that came out on other projects around 1997 ended up lost in the shuffle of the Death Row collapse -- for example, Out The Moon was on the Gridlock'd soundtrack, which went gold, but it nevertheless remains a relatively obscure track because no video was ever made for it and it was never given any serious promotion, Really sad.

Anyway, if you have never heard any of these tracks before, consider yourself lucky and listen to it as a new album from start to finish, you will not be disappointed.",1,0.0

Amazing, considering there are 42 additional bits of music, the shortest at 49 seconds and the longest at more than 5 minutes, most all of them unrecognizable to fans of this classic late-'60's TV show, including myself -- and I've got both seasons of the show on DVD.

The CD is nicely packaged, with the insert booklet fronting a great photo of the show's four main cast members, and contains some interesting text about the making of the show and Dominic Frontiere's remarks on creating the soundtrack.  As with any re-recorded compilation of soundtrack music from a television show performed by  musicians other than the originals (in this case the Graunke Symphony Orchestra, although per the CD's text notes, supposedly conducted by Frontiere), the main theme pieces I mentioned above sound just a tad different from the music on the TV episodes.

Overall, a disappointment, due to the inexplicable omission of some memorable secondary themes and music from the show.  I'm glad I got a used copy, and didn't pay too much  for this item.",0,1.0
2080,"This is an excellent quality CD with the original theme and background music I remember from the 'Rat Patrol' series.

2090,"Gareth Davis and Rutger Zuydervelt have first met around 2009, when the duo recorded their first piece, Soundlines. After the limited edition EP was self-released by Machinefabriek, the duo didn't waste any time, and put out another 3 CDr, titled Ghost Lanes [which later got picked up by Dekorder with an additional track]. A year later, Davis and Zuydervelt got together again, this time for an album for Home Normal, titled Drape. And now the two appear on Sonic Pieces, with a two-part, Grower. Those familiar with Davis, can instantly imagine the brooding darkness this clarinetist can contribute to Zuydervelt's shuffling treatments. At times barely audible, woodwind breathes over low rumbling drones, creating a stilled atmosphere where even a pin drop gets picked up by the mic. The tender poise of each wave is slowly cultivated through a unique language among the two musicians, allowing the sound to unfold on its own, in environment free of grievance.  Focusing on the music, or just letting it seep, is something a mind must decide on its own. In either case, the meditative piece will reward those with patience. No wonder Grower was featured on Headphone Commute's Best of 2011, Music For Sonic Installations In the Cavern Of Your Skull.

I understand bands have to switch their style up, but they are hardly anything like The Supervillains. I don't know what happened to the actual band, but this is nothing like the last album.

Some people will be able to relate when I say that this album makes me feel dirty, and depressed. If thats your style, and something you think you'd enjoy then by all means definitely get this album.

2134,"With the discovery of the recording of the 1942-1945 OTHELLO, by Paul Robeson, the numbers of the albums prove that this recording was not only from 1939, but that it was during the ""Playwrites Company"". A witness saw the production at Jones Beach Theatre.

The partners of Amazon.com have totally falsified the recording of the tour of the 1938 Stadium Concert of Show Boat. In fact it means that this is the FIRST time that ""YOU ARE LOVE"" was written and THAT is the reason that there have been so many lies about the production. Even the EMI collection cited below, I have checked. The 1939 recordings were done in AMERICA, but EMI can transfer as they see fit. HOWEVER, one done in ENGLAND still has a different appearance than one transferred to ENGLAND. Before speaking of why I was buying the records I obtained them. They were from America.

In order to try to fake this as 1946, and long, long after anyone could remember, the BLUE SEAL, or government albums were secretly transferred out of America. Records BEFORE these, and AFTER these were combined into ONE, something Columbia never does, and it was claimed that they were from 1942 and 1945. Well, now that I have Othello, which covers that period, I am going to the National Archives and correcting this, and claiming the rights to the blue seal records that MY GRANDFATHER GAVE ME. In Addition, everyone should know, that one was allowed AD-on's in those days. The person who sang the immediate record added to this was EZIO PINZA, singing the Robison Spirituals that had been used in the original Ziegfeld Show Boat.

Mr. Robison came to AMERICA in early to spring 1938. He brought with him a recording from the Polish Resistence Army, of artists who were in the Jewish Ghettos. Robison had been there. This album is and they were supposed to be part of his recordings of Songs of Free Men. I had thought them lost, but they are now real and in my possession, just as directed by Joseph Toner, who told me of them. Joseph Toner wrote Polinaise, out of the great respect for Mr. Robison who had gone to the Jewish Ghetto's and come out of them with his own song, in the songs of Free Men, missing the songs OF THOSE MEN. Polinaise was produced in 1945 and sung by JOHN CHARLES THOMAS, but only the original test production was ever released, the first time the name of Wrightson was used, and no person yet found to fit the face.

Mr. Robeson, he was able to perform in Othello in 1943 to rave reviews. He also sang a piece by JOHN LATOUCHE about FREEDOM in AMERICA, and was outspoken in his opinions as to how persons of color were then being treated in the US. That was originally Columbia C-49 the Ballad for Americans, Feb. 9 1940. The so called 1932 reconstruction was C-55, approx 1943, and Mr. Robison had only to sing one piece, the rest could be done alone. It was to falsify that the song YOU ARE LOVE had existed. But nobody knew the devious intentions of Mr. Hammerstein. Mr. Melton certainly did. AKA Jimmy Carroll.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Show-Boat-1932-Studio-Cast/dp/B000002Y1H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Show Boat (1932 Studio Cast)</a>

 Ah, a new pseudonym for Joseph Toner, RICHARD TORIGI. There were other TORIGI's such as in My Fair Lady, and some very funny singing others I call the ""lounge lizard"" Torigi but I can only have 10 links so watch out for that.

It took them a long time to get the ""Strativari Strings"" rights. It was the 1943 production by the Met and Kostelanetz. We found the original.

So who sang in 1946?

Everyone was told it was the Met Opera Star Brian Sullivan, whom, after Bernstein left the Met, was tossed out by Richard Rodgers. He killed himself in Geneva, a totally forgotten man.

NYTimes, June 10 1969,""Brian Sullivan, Tenor, 49 is Dead"". NOTE: ""At one point he rehearsed in Italian in 12 days the part of Count Almaviva in Rossini's Barber of Seville: in order to appear with John Charles Thomas ""The Figaro"".

Brian Sullivan was with the MET from 1948-1964. When did Rodgers take control of the met? 1965.

""After the war he (Brian Sullivan) appeared as Gaylord Ravenal in Show Boat, and later in Street Sceen opening on Jan 9th 1947."" His review of Lohgengrin is ""Music: Native Artists""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner-Lohengrin-New-York-April-13-1953-Eleanor-Steber-Margaret-Harshaw-Brian-Sullivan-Sigurd-Bjorling-Dezso-Ernster-Fritz-Stiedry-AND-Excerpts-from-January-25-1945-with-Helen-Traubel-Margaret-Harshaw-Osie-Hawkins-and-Fritz-Busch/dp/B001EV39RA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner: Lohengrin [New York -- April 13, 1953: Eleanor Steber, Margaret Harshaw, Brian Sullivan, Sigurd Bjorling, Dezso Ernster; Fritz Stiedry] AND Excerpts from January 25, 1945 with Helen Traubel, Margaret Harshaw, Osie Hawkins, and Fritz Busch</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weill-Street-Scene/dp/B0000026OM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weill:Street Scene</a>&nbsp;There are dozens and dozens.

Well, you all get the picture huh?

It was John Charles Thomas, IE JOSEPH TONER, who Victor claims in 1932 sang OLD MAN RIVER, BUT a different version was put on the radio in 1926, now on YouTube. We have almost completed the reconstruction of the original 1926 Show Boat. An outside expert puts the date of the 1000 series of John Charles Thomas at 1912. But recently even those that stole this rightfully copywritten american work say it is 1910. JOHN CHARLES THOMAS, the MAJOR OPERA star never appears on any historic Show Boat album by Victor.

This would make JOHN CHARLES THOMAS THE only man to have sung the piece on this side of the Atlantic, not to mention that it was not written by Hammerstein II! This is good reason to supress a person.

Ziegfeld would roll over in his grave.

Recall what SHOW BOAT was all about, civil rights: equality, tolerance, the trouble that came from a two class society, alcoholism, gambling addiction, abandonment, the terrible plight of people of color and prejudice--I cannot give, even JOSEPH TONER AND PAUL ROBESON SINGING SIDE BY SIDE, more than one star for a product that continues what Ziegfeld was trying to END.

EMI put out products that tell part of Robison's story. and definitavely document that he was not in the 1932 Show Boat. One is the EMI Sessions: The Complete EMI Sessions, 1928-1939 [Box Set] Joseph Toner and Robeson both had to sing SHOW BOAT AGAIN to let Robeson go home on the following: Showboat (Stereo LP)Show Boat I await the Shubert/Williamson Corp.

What you have here is an amazing amount of folk music for a cheap price--you can listen for free over at the ""Folk Song A Day"" website, but Boden should be encouraged with cash on the barrelhead--where the 365 songs total in the twelve monthly albums is some enormous part of the British folksong tradition. The heart of his endeavor is traditional English folksong, but he has healthy amounts of Irish and Scottish folksong, modern songs (folk, pop, musicals, humorous, etc.), and a fair dollop of songs composed by and/or sung by Boden's idol, Peter Bellamy. A fair sprinkling of the songs sung in the ""Folk Song A Day"" project appear later in Boden's solo or joint albums--he was trying them out here first, I think. Boden's great strength is interpretation--he makes you listen to the songs' words and think about what they mean, makes coherent stories out of them. To that he adds a fine voice--better than Bellamy's, for a not so random example. I cannot recommend these highly enough.

-----

I tripped and fell, and laughed after hiding the sky I was drawing
I bowed my head and while pretending to be oblivious, stood under the umbrella alone

The future feels like it's about to disappear everytime I wish for something
Everytime I cling, I become dyed in black

Solve it and don't touch me, even when I'm dyed in sadness
The color of you hand that I grabbed while laughing
Is forgotten - The day I close my eyes
The colorful world will surely turn into black and white

I repeat ""goodbye"" and traced ""see you again""
I decided to cry.
Saying since bowing my head hurts, that I don't need warmth

The future feels like it's about to disappear everytime I wish for something
Everytime I cling, I'm painted in white

If, if in the hollow world,
I can live only by embracing
Your fading sound that echoes and smears
Do I need any other songs?

In the touch that I longed for,
The color blue was hurt and buried
I reach out my hand and cut off the connection
Until everything rots away

Even when I touch, connect, and dye in sadness,
Our hands echo and smear
The world that I drew while embracing and overlapping
Paints me in vivid colors countless times",1,1.0

Hours later, it came to me: it was the development, for lack of a better word, in the first movement of Moments Musicaux. Fearsome in the reaping, it brought the nihilism of the Tempest to mind:

""Our revels now are ended. These our actors, as I foretold you, were all spirits and are melted into air, into thin air:  And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,  the cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples, the great globe itself, ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve and, like this insubstantial pageant faded,  leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.""

What then, of castles in the air?

I normally avoid D 780  and the first two movements in particular  like Red Spot-itis. Theyre scarier, IMO, than Death and the Maiden or Winterreise. Is it not amazing that Schubert could be so brave, with so little happiness in the bank and beleaguered by dissolution as he was? Think too, that somehow or other melody parries darkness in a sphere beyond the temporal. On this occasion, I thought it best to heed the omen so I sought out a new recording. Aunty Mitsuko came into frame and went just as quickly. It was news to me that Gilels had recorded it  he was a tad too fast for my liking. I don't know who Shino Moroto is. I daresay shell attract the attention of the worst elements of the Australian Knappertsbusch Association - animals one and all! In any event, this lass can play. Imagination, touch, depth of tone and ease with the space between notes  she has it all. Moroto is also cognisant that Schuberts piano-works are more penses than fodder for the concert hall: intimacy is always apparent. Insofar as one can enjoy D 780, she delivers the goods. Unblinkingly, the anguish and desolation of MM 1 & 2 are vented. She could possibly go harder in MM 5. Moroto also guns D 899. Just listen to her in the famous G-Flat Impromptus: one could float away in the breeze! Thats perfection!

Recording-wise, this is phenomenal. As she weaves her magic, all one say is ""Bravo Shino!""",1,0.0

2253,"I've been monitoring my sleep with a Zeo sleep monitor system that measures your actual brainwave patterns while sleeping.  Unaided, I typically get 5-20 minutes of delta wave (aka deep sleep) sleep.

My Zeo measured a whopping 13 mins of delta wave sleep; no statistical improvement over unaided sleep for me.

I'm a believer in the effectiveness of binaural beats and therefore disappointed that so many of these MP3s like this don't produce results.  I suspect the process of making an audio track into an MP3 actually destroys the binaural beats (MP3 conversion strips out frequencies the converter thinks you won't notice as missing as part of the compression scheme); however, if you listen carefully I think you can hear the tones behind the water noises.  Perhaps the CD version of this would work better.

The water sounds aren't unpleasant, and they seem to be fairly consistent in volume, so I gave an extra star, but in the end, if you advertise as a product that produces deep sleep and you don't, I can't recommend it.",0,0.0

2261,"Born in New York City in 1917, orchestra arranger/conductor Robert ""Bob"" Mersey began his long career in the late 1930s with the Big Bands of Abe Lyman and Woody Herman before joining NBC radio after WW II as their staff arranger. Following a stint in Europe in the late 1940s where he scored several film soundtracks, he returned to the U.S. in the 1950s, joining the Gordon Jenkins orchestra as their arranger. He followed that with the same work at Big Top Records, a label launched in 1958 by Johnny Bienstock, where he also released one single under the pseudonym Spencer Ross,  Bobby's Blues/Theme Of A Lonely Evening  (Big Top 3035) in 1960. It did not chart nationally.

He then moved over to Columbia and CBS TV, and their subsidiary Colpix where, mostly under his real name Robert Mersey, he did arranging/conducting for artists like Andy Williams (some 17 of Andy's hits were backed by Mersey), as well as Barbra Streisand, Johnny Mathis, Nina Simone, James Darren, Aretha Franklin, Johnny Nash, Dion (DiMucci), Frankie Avalon and many more. He also found time to release three more singles of his own and one LP as Spencer Ross, with the first being his only claim to national fame in terms of a hit record. That was Tracy's Theme, written by Robert Archer for the female character in the December 7, 1959  CBS TV production The Philadelphia Story, originally a 1940 film and, in 1956, re-made as the musical High Society. Featuring the great saxophone work of Jimmy Abalo, and released as Columbia 4-41532 under the billing Spencer Ross, it peaked at # 13 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in January/February 1960 b/w Thanksgiving Day Parade, from the TV production Miracle On 34th Street. Why it never made any impact on the Adult Contemporary (Easy Listening) charts at the time is a mystery since it was a perfect fit for those listings.

That success led to the 1960 album covered here, titled simply Spencer Ross & His Orchestra (Columbia CL-1525/CS 8325) containing:  La Montana (If She Should Come To You); Carolina Moon; I Go; Dreamy Melody; Theme From ""I Am A Camera"" (Why Do I?); Hop, Skip, Jump; Tracy's Theme; Song For A Summer Night; Solitaire; Play Some Music For Broken Hearts; What's It Like In Paree?; Your Continental Touch. Two of the tracks - Song For A Summer Night/Dreamy Melody then came out as the single Columbia 4-41644, and a bit later in 1960 he had Theme From ""My Three Sons""/Heaven Can Wait r4eleased as Columbia 4-41877. Neither could get him back on the charts, nor did his interpretation of Song Of India which, billed as The Bob Mersey Orchestra, came out as one side of Colpix 152 (the flip, Strangers When We Meet by the Stu Phillips orchestra, didn't chart either).

In 1962 he apparently released an acclaimed - and yet obscure - album on Gallant Records titled Great Jazz From Great TV which, although showing on the label that it was composed, arranged and conducted by Bob Mersey, was credited to yet another pseudonym - ""Det Moore & His Orchestra."" This contains: Jazz Dramatic; Club Cool; Forever Frantic; Call Girl; and Flutesville, among others from shows like Ben Casey, Route 66, The New Breed, Manhunt, My Three Sons, Window On Main Street, Armstrong Circle Theater, Kraft Mystery Theater, and Play Of The Week.

I'm surprised some outfit like Collectables or Collector's Choice hasn't yet remastered both albums for CD format. If they do, one would hope they'd include those non-album sides mentioned as ""bonus"" tracks. If all you want is Tracy's Theme an excellent copy can be found in Eric Records wonderful volume Hard To Find Orchestral Instrumentals.",1,1.0

2271,"Hailing from upstate NY, the Spring Standards wowed a small crowd this summer (2010) at a WXPN-sponsored show in Haddon Lake Park in South Jersey.  Except for an occasional assist by the band's manager on second guitar, the band was a self-contained trio of multi-taskers.  Heather Robb, James Cleave and James Smith sang lead and harmony and simultaneously covered either bass and bass drum, acoustic guitar and high-hat, or piano/organ and snare/tom.  The drum parts were lockstep - you'd have sworn there was a drummer hidden behind a speaker column.  All but track two (due to language) made it to the live show.  So what does the disc sound like?  Pretty much the same as the infectious live show.  Scattershot blues (""Here I Am"").  Cabaret piano (""Queen of the Lot"").  Scrappy Appalachian backbeats (""The Hush"").  Fingerstyle ballads (""Frozen"").  Decemberists-style rock (""Not Again"").  And lots of layered vocals in unusually close harmonies (""Skyline,"" ""Bells and Whistles,"" ""Trouble"").  If you crossed Paul Simon, Lady Antebellum, and the Pretenders, would things be different?  It's likely -- the Spring Standards have set a new one.",1,0.0

It was my first exposure to Nguyn L's guitar, which can mimic the Vietnamese zither, the dan tranh. Suddenly, it was the late 1960's and the Vietnam War was a clear and present danger. Moreover, the interlude suggested the Grateful Dead's soundtrack to Apocalypse Now. This album covers tunes of my youth, and although they are not as powerful in effect as the mentioned track, and are somewhat uneven in arrangement with undistinguished vocals, they are fun to hear with their modern and global intepretation, with flavors of India, Vietnam, and the Middle East. L is mainly a jazz musician but this album is more rock in style, and it suffers by it. [How can I put aside the deeply etched original Beatles, Joplin, Stevie Wonder, Bob Marley issues? A pure instrumental album would have been better.] L has over a dozen other musicians and vocalists involved in this 70-minute long album. The album is probably L's venture into the popular market, and I hope that the cross-over is just a visit. For his truly world jazz album, see Saiyuki.",1,1.0

The last time he was heard was in 2001 with his sequel to The Chronic. Yet, he has awaited a long time to come out with something new. With rap fans eagerly anxious over his Detox release, he has shown his age, and his loss with I Need A Doctor, the lead single from that album. The song really isn't very strong in his collaboration with Enimem, and instead lets Eminem take the spotlight over him. I really felt that they did lose a lot of chemistry. He really did let the rhymes slide. I think Dr. Dre really does need a doctor right now. Hopefully, he'll get better with Detox coming out, if it does come alive soon.

To see how much they've grown into their own unique sound with Have You Seen My Prefrontal Cortex? and their best effort so far, You're Always On My Mind. When compared to those two, it's just mediocre albums. The sound isn't that tight and the vocals are really raw. The Fiery Works II is probably my least favorite of the two. The songs aren't as good as the previous one, in my opinion. If you're new to the band, skip these for now, but if you've listened to the new albums and you've become a fan, then it's nice to check these out and see how much they've grown.",0,0.0

Strange to say, Cobra has one signal triumph to his name.

I would have thought that Bruckner could have survived his onslaught and indeed, flourished in doing so given that his time-space continuum does not differ greatly from the Master of Bayreuth. How wrong I was.

This is eternity, Jim, but not as we know it.

Consider, if you dare, the timings of his Bruckner Ninth: 47'21"" for the first movement, followed by 18'35"" for the Scherzo and a mind-shredding, soul-destroying 39'08"" for the finale. It's an invitation to go mad or befriend the Kardashians. The subtext was clear: there is no god. In desperation, I rang Hell's hotline in the hope of selling my soul to the Devil for a few shillings. It too, was unmanned. We are alone - alone with the Cobra!

I agree with Klaus Heid. Either this orchestra is computer-generated or Tempus reused the DG's recording equipment from Karajan's 1980 performance of the Alpine Symphony.

Well, with Hogjaw, they have around 15 songs that are lasting way past anything I've experienced in the past and I see no end to jamming them everywhere I go.

2362,"The Ironwood is an extraordinary plant that lives in the Arizona desert in extreme climatic and environmental conditions, a towering plant capable of living up to 1500 years, thus a symbol of unmatched tenacity and power, that we find in Hogjaw's brand new CD, titled Ironwood, from Phoenix (Ariz) and of which I spoke at their debut in 2008.

With their debut album, Devil in the Details they already made it clear what they were made of, but with this new CD they stormed by force in the Olympus of the renovated and seething Southern Rock movement.

Immediately at first hearing the charge and bullying style of the band strikes hard, with incisive and powerful guitars of Craig Self and Jonboat Jones and melancholy voice and biting of the same Jones, combined with the incessant rhythm of Kwall's drums and Elvis DD on bass, with whom I had a pleasant exchange of emails and I learned him to be of Italian origin as well as a Gulf War veteran.

As soon as Rollin' Thunder opens you cannot fail to turn up the volume, its charge is a perfect and overwhelming starter to the subsequent Backtop and Three Fifty Seven, which has absolutely breathtaking riffs and scorching solos.

We find a little pause around the fifth track, County Line with typical old southern melodies and a long and beautiful final solo with an atmosphere reminiscent of the Skynyrd sound, and then resume to the initial power with Ain't ever gonna win until the final Hornsnowgglin that brings us back with our feet on the ground, throwing us in the deep south made of slide guitars and whiskey burnt voices.

A CD that is a real shot of adrenaline with really inspired songs, powerful riffs and fiery solos, but at the same time takes us away in the deep and dusty southwest rediscovering the old melodies of 70' Southern Rock, enriched with a powerful and aggressive sound I like to call Heavy Southern Rock.

A CD not to miss in your Southern record library, but I am convinced that lovers of good music and of the most powerful rock will like this too, a job which I believe is already among the best Southern Rock albums of this 2010.",1,1.0

2426,"Urban Myth Club's second release, I'm relieved to say, is most certainly not a letdown!

The songs are fresh yet the quality of the first album (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Helium/dp/B000EFTENA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Helium</a>) is preserved, and, dare I say, surpassed!?
The virtual worlds these songs create are richer, more alive than the previous go-around, but each track is just as engaging as Helium's were, and have just as much staying power, if not more. Put one of these songs on repeat for as long as you want, you won't be playing these tunes out any time soon! ;)

I say play this album in the background while spending some quality time with your lover...this one sets a particular mood. *wink, wink*

I'm a bigger fan of the 1st half of this album than the second. For some reason, I find that the 1st set of tracks seem to be catchier and more memorable than the rest. None of the songs are ""bad"" but let's just say I wouldn't be able to identify the title of a track from the second half of the album, if I was given only the first few seconds to listen to. They're still good, but they just never ""stuck"".

My lineup of favorites are as follows (in chronological order):

1 - Wake Up
2 - Surrender
3 - Don't Need To Say It
4 - Everything's All Right
5 - Coming Home
7 - We Have Landed

Of these, We Have Landed is the most provocative. It's a haunting, brooding track that stays with you for a while after hearing it.
Creepy and sad in all the best ways. I can see this being the opening title track to another James Bond adventure flick. Nice counterpart to So Beautiful.

I would describe Coming Home as a sort of ""sequel"" to Helium's Calling. Likewise, Everything's All Right seems like Open Up's answer to Spacewalk from Helium. That's not to say these are just different arrangements of the same songs. Not at all! They just have a similar kind of tone & tempo...set a similar mood. Another reviewer, writing about the Helium album, PERFECTLY stated how I feel about Everything's All Right when they said it's ""Great to play in the morning when you're just getting into the grind."" [K. Bowden]

Woke up with a hangover? Throw on that Wake Up track (on low volume, of course). You'll laugh your butt off! (Or you would if it didn't hurt so much to laugh) The guy's voice asserting ""It's a wonderful day!"" - you'll be rolling your eyes thinking ""Yeah ----ing right!!"" XD -- Good stuff!

Surrender is slightly more up-tempo than most of the other songs, with a couple exceptions (more on that later), and is a JOY to listen to!
The girl's voice is so PERFECT! I would compare it to The Cardigans' lead in My Favorite Game. Maybe even Ellie Goulding.
Either way, her voice just has a great tone to it. Hard to describe, but sort of...smoky?...dollish? Anyway, it's awesome! (EDIT: I just realized Bjork's voice most closely matches the girl in Surrender's voice)

But Don't Need To Say It is by FAAAAAAR my favorite! It's such a cool sound! Lyrically, this song is an extension - if not a carbon copy - of I Feel It; but this is forgivable in my eyes given the amazing quality of the music itself: evocative of the orgy scene music from Eyes Wide Shut, only better, of course! ;) The vocal engineering is stellar! CRAZY-good!!! And not just on the ""twisted"" bits, I mean all throughout. Just a killer sound with some sweet lyrics that'll make you feel all ooey-gooey inside (or warm 'n fuzzy for the old-schoolers)! Gotta love it!! Can't praise that track enough!

---

Now, despite their exclusion from my list, the remaining tracks on this album are most definitely worth a listen! (Heck, I didn't like Spacewalk at all until the day I decided to play the whole Helium album through for a change. Now it goes into every playlist I create!)

I'd say Fragile is the greatest deviation from anything UMC's done. VERY up-tempo! I almost thought my media player had switched to another album when I first heard it! Took me a few listens to warm up to it, as it's more of a Pop song than all the other UMC songs, in this album or the last.
Friday Night is also quite different, but not as Pop-ish as Fragile. Has sort of a ""YouTube compilation video"" feel to it. But it works, I guess... (again, not a particular fave of mine)

[Note]: There are actually 14 tracks on this album. I'm not sure if an Amazon purchase grants you the 14th (I can't see why it wouldn't, but there's no guarantee), but buying the album (CD or mp3) directly from the UMC site will get you a special download link! :) The last song's pretty high tempo as well, but it's all electronica, zero pop.

I know I've made a lot of comparisons between this and the previous album - that this one should really stand on its own, and it does. I just wanted to reassure fans of the original that this is not simply a collection of the same music, nor is it a set of new songs of lesser quality. This is sure to appeal to new and old fans alike!

All things said, Open Up is a more-than-worthy follow-up to Urban Myth Club's monumental debut. If this trend continues, what comes next is gonna be magic!!",1,0.0

2430,"I always fast-forward past this song when it appears on the Divine Office. ORG Liturgy of the Hours podcast. I cannot stand the sappy-sweet breathy lovey-dovey cutie pie singing or the treacly instrumentation. The worst part is when the music swells (seemingly in time with the swells of the singer's head) and she sings the bridge. All in all, this is a mere erotic love song that does not once mention God or LORD or Jesus. It is not even thinly-veiled. It is a sorry excuse for a liturgical hymn. This song should not only be removed from the repertoire, it should be destroyed with great prejudice and violence to the master tapes.",0,0.0

2451,"The title of this listing is [somewhat] misleading; the actual title of this cd is:

ENGLAND - NEW ENGLAND
Romantic Clarinet Sonatas

It would be nice if the listing would reflect this; instead of just saying Romantic Clarinet Sonatas. Had I known this I would not have purchased this cd.

The two star rating is based on two things:
1. I was disappointed when I received this disc because it wasn't what I was expecting.
2. I am not much of a fan of this genre of music.

That being said, if you like this genre of music you may very well give this cd five stars; the quality of the performances and the recording seem very good.

The works on this cd are:

1-3 David Tovey (1875 - 1940): Sonata for Clarinet and Piano Op. 16

4-6 Daniel Mason (1873 - 1953): Sonata for Clarinet and Piano Op. 14

7-9 York Bowen (1884 - 1969): Sonata for Clarinet and Piano Op. 109

The performers are:

John Denman: Clarinet

Paula Fan: Piano

The record label is:

British Music Label

Recorded in 1986; released in 1992

2457,"To be blunt - this simply isn't Raintime anymore. While on Flies and Lies they put together a masterful album, for this release, they flopped. The growls and sublime aggression in Flies and Lies is history. For Psychochromatic they opted for not just all clean vocals, but weak clean vocals with none of the passion carried in the clean vocals of Flies and Lies.

I've tried to give this album a chance, but it's just horrible. I mean there is still a few good moments musically, but with all the growls, aggression and passion that made Flies and Lies so amazing and unique (not easy in an genre full of carbon copies!), Psychochromatic is but a shell of what Raintime used to be. It has the fingerprints of sellout all over it and the CD is better used as a drink coaster than music entertainment.

They also pull the ""cut down on guitar solos"" thing on this album. That is one of my biggest pet peeves that a band could pull. The guitarist in this band is fantastic, and i find it annoying that he is now only soloing on 2 or 3 songs on their new album. Raintime sound completely different, and im not happy with the change.

This is one of the reasons why people pirate music.  The previous reviewer is too kind on them.  This is not good.  Not in any shape or form.  Plus this is completely boring.  They have turned into an old school metal outfit with modern rock choruses that you hear on MTV and the radio.  They really don't pull it off well.  Growls???..what growls.

""Big Money Sonny"" slams BP's response to its mammoth oil spill.

Liberty's ""The Trial of Perry Redd"" weaves a common portrait of criminal justice cahoots and the pro se representation that leads to judicial victory. This ""Land of Mine,"" a collaboration with Dirty Redd, rails against gentrification in USA cities, as well as overseas in Palestine. It's on time.

In fact I feel they are such a talented band it's almost a shame they are a Christian band. And by that I mean the simple fact that we all know there are a lot of people who listen to this type of music who are turned off at the mere mention of the words ""Christian rock"", which is a shame, a real shame.

Both their playing abilities and compositional skills are top-notch and I have NO doubt what-so-ever that, if not for the lyrics and label, this band would be playing the mid-level club circuit and have major label backing. Maybe even bigger.

But respect to them for sticking to their beliefs and not selling out and conforming to what the mainstream wants, simply for more exposure.  I can only hope that more people wake up to their talent and they get the recognition they deserve.

2571,"Alexi Murdoch's ""Towards the Sun"" is a spare, melancholy song that might be about a lost love, a lost connection with God, a feeling of invisibility, the changing of the seasons, or all of the above -- who can be sure? In any event, the song is unmistakeably evocative of and influenced by Nick Drake, the brilliant but troubled British singer-songwriter who died in 1974. (Drake is probably best known today for the song ""Pink Moon"", used a few years ago in a Volkswagen ad.) Everything about ""Towards the Sun"" recalls Drake: the sleepy, oddly accented vocals, the delicate tune, the deceptively simple lyrics, the rhythmically strummed guitar, and the judicious use of background instrumentals that never threaten to overwhelm Murdoch's voice or guitar. If you've never heard Drake, you may find Murdoch's sound to be a stunning revelation ... or not. If you're a Drake fan, you will probably either be wowed by Murdoch's fidelity to the original or offended by Murdoch's imitation of your idol. Maybe both. Regardless, ""Towards the Sun"" is a good song, and well worth a listen.",1,1.0

2573,"I am a big fan of what I call 'vibe' music. I am not such an afficianado that I can talk about lounge vs. chill vs. ambient and actually know what I am talking about. I defer to the 'expert' reviewers for that. However, I enjoy buying CDs that you can set a mood to. I have my La Perla CDs for chilling out and relaxing. I have my W Hotel CDs for entertaining and errr ... making out to. ha ha It has been my experience that these CDs really do set a good mood for when you are entertaining a member of the fairer sex. Not too romantic that it is sappy, not too slow to put her to sleep and not too fast to make her want to dance.

There are several great tracks on this CD, but it is all over the place. It starts off with a song that belongs on the runway of a fashion show (or in a strip club) with Goldfrap's 'Lovely to See You'. This song alone is a hot tune, but it sets a pace that the CD cannot keep up with. There is a hard thumping beat song next which is more typical W Hotel Lounge. This is the one you want to put on before you slide next to her on the couch. Or if you are starring in a James Bond style movie trailer. 'I'm a Fire' by Donna Summer comes next, which is too upbeat after the mellow song before it and sounds too much like something you'd hear in an Abercrombie and Fitch store. I worked there for 3 years, I should know. Next comes 'Yangin' by Zarena, which is straight out of a Turkish Bizzare. It almost sounds like a cross between Bollywood and Afghanistan. Doesn't belong on this CD. The worst song, a terrible remix of 'Angel' by Natasha Bettingfield comes next ... this belongs more on a 'High School Graduation '07' CD mix than it does on a W Hotels CD. Skip this. Another miss comes next with 'Wow' by Kylie Menogue. This belongs on a 'Middle School Graduation '07 Mix' CD. Soooo bad.

'Tell me why' is a sexy song with a hard pulsing beat that belongs in the hippest of lounges. Followed by another teenie bopper type of song that will take anyone out of the mood for romance. It sounds like something that belongs in a commercial for a Canadian department store or a low budget generic 'High School Musical' type tv show. ""Shot You Down' by Audio Bully is an interesting and very sexy song that really would be at home in a New Jersey dance club. While I wonder why this was put on the CD, I can't help but think at some point I might have a use for this song. Just when you think the CD couldn't get any more ecclectic and flow any worse 'Dream Catch Me' comes along which is an upbeat EMO style guitar song that could be used as the music in a commercial for Dawson's Creek on the WB. 'As Serious as Your Life' is an odd song comprised mostly of looped beats and a guitar riff. Very Volkswagon Car commercial. Finally, just to prove they could ... they put the remix of the James Bond theme 'You Only Live Twice' by Shirly Bassy. With a heavy bass guitar in the background the classic 70s James Bond song was done wrong and placed at the end of the CD. The lounge and the 70s glitz just don't go together. Its like watching a James Bond movie while having a Jazz Brunch on Sunday.

This CD is a bit like obscure performance art. It makes you think and ask yourself 'Why would anyone do that?' This is such a mish mash of songs ... most of them bad. I will be taking Track 1, 2, maybe 3, 7, 9 (dont ask me why), and maybe 11 to my IPod. Really though, there are around 3 good songs on here unless your job is to pick the music for car commercials and commercials promoting television shows. In which case this CD would be a goldmine for you. For creating a loungy vibe such as you would find in a W Hotel lobby or bar it doesn't even come close to being decent. It is scitzophrenically bad compared to the usual W Hotel CDs. In fact, I might bring this and leave it in the room instead of taking a CD the next time I stay at a W.",0,0.0

2591,"One of the most rewarding aspects of writing about music in general and jazz in particular is to discover that Independent diamond in the rough. I love going in cold on a new artist and with the exception of the appearance of guitarist Ron Jackson, I had no clue on Bartlett, Jr. but can now say with confidence that he is easily one of the most talented young players to drop a debut release at for what may considered to be the slightly advanced age of 28.

Hopeful is a somewhat conceptualized riff on where Bartlett Jr. views his place in life and the possibilities that lay ahead for his career. An apt title if ever there was one as Hopeful finds a energetic balance between the straight ahead and the modern contemporary without sacrificing either. What is even more impressive is the six of the eight tunes are solid originals and the two covers are the standard ""It Could Happen To You"" and the theme from ""I Love Lucy."" Granted a television show theme caused a raised eyebrow but the tune has wonderful changes and Bartlett, Jr. turns a shop worn TV theme into a swing tune with surprising energy. ""Quantum Leaps (And Bounds)"" is a blistering romp featuring one of New York's finest if not most under-rated guitarists in Ron Jackson. The high octane tune is an exhilarating romp between Jackson and Bartlett, Jr. as though they have played together for years. The solos and trades are well executed and avoid the potential self indulgent pitfalls that tend to plague some debut recordings. An ability to change dynamics and dial it down is executed with perfection on another Bartlett, Jr. original ""Julia B."" The thoughtful ballad opens with bassist Eric Lemon who brings another layer of musical flavor and intense lyrical purpose to this finely crafted tune. Emanuel Harold rounds on the rhythm section on drums along with pianist Sharp Radway to keep the ensemble on the straight but swinging path. Charles Bartlett is on trumpet and turns in a solid performance on the standard ""It Could Happen To You.""

Carl Bartlett, Jr. is the real deal. An instrumentalist with full command of his weapon of choice that being the alto saxophone and showing off mad skills as both a producer and composer, Bartlett Jr. is a legitimate jazz triple threat and a name to keep an eye on. The future of modern jazz is now!

2592,"SUPERB is right!  I have rarely, if ever, heard Sonny Stitt sound like this.  Everybody knows about his instrumental prowess, so let's talk about his sound for a moment.  On this particular album, Stitt's sound is so rich, so full, so visceral, it sounds as if he's gonna pop right out of the speakers and play in your living room right next to you.  I have NEVER heard Sonny play with such a full, enveloping tone as he does here. At first, I thought he might have quit smoking or something, but there he is with holding a cigarette on the cover.  But he must have done something to obtain the lavish, sumptuous timbre he plays with on With the New Yorkers.

And speaking of which, the New Yorkers in question (Hank Jones on piano, Wendell Marshall on bass, and Shadow Wilson on drums) support Stitt with aplomb here, never getting in the way, but playing more than we are accustomed to from rhythm sections on Sonny's Roost albums).  Hank Jones plays several fine solos throughout, and comps well behind Stitt's solos.  And what solos they are!  Sonny, in addition to sounding better than usual tonally, is very much inspired throughout this disc.  Maybe he ate his Wheaties the morning of this session.  I mean, he usually sounds good, but he has never, to my knowledge, sounded THIS good. I'm talking in terms of tone, power and timbre. What a transparent, beautiful sound!

When I noticed that there were no reviews for this album, I knew I had to review it!  There are well over one hundred Stitt albums recorded and some of them are bound to get lost in the shuffle.  So I considered it my civic duty to turn people on to this album, so I could tell the  world (assuming that Amazon RR readers represent the world) the this is an astonishing record that you shouldn't miss.  Please note that I am reviewed the Fresh Sounds vinyl reissue here, and the pressing is excellent.  If you only need one Stitt album in your jazz collection, you can't possibly do better than choosing Sonny Stitt and the New Yorkers (uh, doesn't he play with ""New Yorkers"" on all his albums?).

Anyway, BUY IT!",1,1.0

True, he did produce several classic singles for the Ronettes, Crystals and Righteous Brothers that are some of the most beloved Oldies from the 60s, but he was not on par with someone like Paul McCartney or John Lennon who could craft entire concept albums that remain classics 50-plus years later.

I am not bashing Phil nor his music, just using my above statement to back up my two-star review for this CD that is only worth getting for HES A REBEL, DA DOO RON RON and THEN HE KISSED ME. The other songs on here are nowhere near as good as the three hits. Its too bad that the Crystals didn't have better material, but I feel a little of Phils sound went a long wayit only worked with the right melodies and lyrics, and the rest of whats here is lacking. I fell in love with the Crystals hits back in the early 80s and actually liked them better than the Shirelles or the Chiffons back then. But Ive heard a few of the Shirelles albums recorded in the 60s and even the deep album cuts are much better than the second-string hits found here by The Crystals.

It lacks Julie's exquisite intimacy, sensualism and sophisticated arrangements of her earlier albums. There is honestly not one memorable cut on this album. In fact by the horribly hokey rendition of Never On Sunday.. I was actually slightly insulted.

I'm the author of the book Lady Liberty: The Definitive Julie London Handbook available on Amazon.  As a jazz pianist and vocalist myself who had met Julie London and Bobby Troup as well as performed with several Julie's musicians including Al Viola. Julie called this album herself ""shlock"".  She was forced by contract to mold to current bubble gum pop tastes and started to move further away from the winning concept formula of her earlier cool jazz and bluesy albums.  Also terribly disappointing was the horrific album cover that pencil sketched and not Julie's usually gorgeous photo, there were no liner notes for this album too. It was horrible package haphazardly thrown together. Though she does convincingly give a little tongue in cheek on ""Come On a My House"" ...... but not if this mediocre album is playing. UGG

Amazon, I realize that this is a play by the artist's label (RCA) to uphold Ms. Lavigne's ""Bad Girl"" reputation.  However, everything I've ever purchased on Amazon upholds your brand of honesty and integrity.  I recently switched to Amazon to purchase all of my music because I got fed up with The Apple Store.

Please find a way to exchange the ""radio version"" you sold me for the ""radio version"" that is really played on the radio.  You have the pull.

2707,"As a long time lover of Delius' music, I was keen on hearing this new disc, particularly as it contains the first recording of ""A Poem of Life and Love"", parts of which were later recast (with the help of Eric Fenby) into ""A Song of Summer"". I approached this recording with some trepidation, however, as I've found David Lloyd-Jones to be a problematic conductor, whose interpretations are often characterized by a lack of clear focus as well as rhythmic slackness. Unfortunately, my fears were  justified in this instance.

At 17 minutes, ""A Poem of Life and Love"" is quite a substantial work. It provides fascinating listening, although the sections which were to be later salvaged are all the more conspicuous for their superior musical quality. Much of the rest of the work is second rate at best, with a principal theme sounding like something from Delius' student years. Fenby was entirely accurate in his negative estimation of it (as tellingly recreated in Ken Russell's film), and hearing the original conception makes one appreciate and admire ""A Song of Summer"" all the more.

The ""Irmelin"" Suite (as arranged by Beecham from Delius' early opera) is pleasant enough, although Delius'/Fenby's later ""Irmelin"" Prelude has more genuine musical quality and interest in its five minutes than in this fifteen-minute compilation.

I've always found ""Life's Dance"" to be a problematic work. It predates ""Paris"" (1899) by a year (though it was revised later), and indulges in some of the same Straussian orchestral virtuosity. However, after an impressively energetic opening and a  gloriously lyrical secondary theme, the piece degenerates into a short-breathed and often rhythmically monotonous central section, which cannot be rescued by a return to the opening and a final climax. To barrel through the tedious central portion, as Lloyd-Jones does here, doesn't help matters either, as instrumental detail gets muddied and/or lost in the shuffle. I don't find that any of the earlier recordings by Groves(EMI) Del Mar(Unicorn) or Holten(Danacord) are successful either, though Del Mar comes closest to making this piece work.

The suite from ""A Village Romeo and Juliet"" is David Matthews' revision of his own earlier(1987) version, written at the request of, and recorded by Carl Davis with the London Philharmonic(Virgin). In this revision, the concluding ""Walk to the Paradise Garden"" is replaced with the actual final music of the opera. Given the comparative familiarity of ""Paradise Garden"" I can see the reason for the revision, although I found the original version of this suite to be musically more convincing, as the ""Paradise Garden actually follows the Berghald  Fair scene in the opera, and the transition is Delius' own. Carl Davis' recording of the original version is also much more musically alive as well as better played and recorded. Matthews' new transition to the final scene is a bit awkward in my opinion, as are all of his other transitions, but the idea of a symphonic synthesis from VRJ is a good one. I could imagine a more extended (30-35 minute) suite including both the ""Paradise Garden"" and the wonderful dream music from scene 4.

As I said at the outset, I often find Lloyd-Jones' conducting to be problematic, and this disc is no exception. Granted, the RSNO is not a first class ensemble, but under conductors such as Jarvi or Gibson the orchestra can sound more than respectable. On this recording, however, balances are uniformly bad, with coarse, strident brass and weak upper-register strings, problems which are not helped by the garish quality of the recording itself. Overall ensemble is ragged to the point that this whole recording sounds like an under-rehearsed rush job. The only real reason for acquiring this disc is for the ""Poem"". The asking price by these Amazon sellers is outrageous; I would direct anyone interested in acquiring this recording to prestoclassical.co.uk, where I obtained it for $15.

2718,"From the cover, one would assume that John Gatti's ""Destinations"" is a solo album, but is it? Each track sounds like a band made up of piano, keyboards, percussion, and a wide variety of other instruments and voices, but no other artist credits are given. That only leaves one explanation - that John Gatti is a one-man band. Further exploration of the liner reveals that this is the case. Wow! How does one jazz musician keep the music so loose and free yet completely in synch? The only answer to that question is pure artistry, and it's truly amazing. ""Destinations"" is comprised of thirteen original compositions inspired by places Gatti and his wife have visited over the years, and the music spins a mood of joy and unbridled fun. From funky jazz to steel drums to Latin stylings and more, the album provides more than an hour of great music. I listened to it four times in succession while driving from the SF Bay Area to the Oregon Coast the other day and absolutely loved it with the volume cranked up and my sunroof wide open.

""Destinations"" begins with ""Cotton Candy,"" a funky piece with a great beat and laid-back style. Inspired by a vendor at Yankee Stadium, piano, percussion, voices, and guitar provide the perfect groove to get this set started. ""Watermelon Summer"" conveys the easy spirit of getting away for some time by the ocean. If you can keep still while listening to ""Old San Juan,"" you'd better check your pulse! A high-energy piece with a spicy Latin flavor, I love this one!  ""Cast Away"" takes us to the Caribbean and the joyful sound of steel drums. ""Jet-Glider"" has a more synthesized sound and ambient feeling, suggesting the wonder of falling water, air, sky, and freedom. ""Saltimboca"" is a lively piano and percussion tribute to New Orleans - another piece that makes it impossible to sit still - also a favorite. ""Struttin' Around Pines Lake"" brings back some easy funk and synth scat singing (how'd he do that?) backed by a strong drum beat, organ, and bass guitar. ""Tomorrow's Showers,"" for Seattle, WA, is a slow groove for piano, percussion, and synth - very soothing and relaxed. ""Cooling Down"" (San Francisco) is the epitome of West Coast Cool (although it was composed for Joyce Cooling and her husband). Piano, percussion, bass, and synth washes make this an easy-going and addictive gem. ""Pepe's Dancing Feet"" (Atlanta, GA) brings the album to a close with a celebration of good friends, good food, and fun. It just doesn't get any better than this!

""Destinations"" is a fantastic album to lift the spirit and to celebrate life. I expect it to be one of my favorites for the year. Very highly recommended!",1,0.0

I am surprised that these are in the set, when there are so many other classic songs to pick from. I was particularly looking forward to Overload. While Mick's guitar work in this is spot on, it lacks punch. A lot of the backing and harmony vocal is pretty average. There are sections where some of the instruments seem to fade out. There is a desperate need for some mixing here. Overall Burnies vocal work is very good, however, he does have the occassional flat spot. I am probably a little critical. I am sure if this were re-mixed it would come out sounding great. For a bootleg it's not bad but I would probably recommend saving your money and spending it on the other live recordings.",0,0.0

2731,"The music of Ib Nrholm (b. 1931) is quite well represented on disc, and Kontrapunkt seems to have championed it with some enthusiasm. The disc at hand appeared to me to be a representative samples; maybe it is, maybe it isn't, but at least it provides no impetus to explore his output further. Nrholm's style is a little hard to pin down; whereas the symphonic fantasy Hearing Andersen and the suite The Shadow are dissonant, expressionist but essentially (neo-)romantic and accessible the fifth symphony is rather forbiddingly dense and uncompromising.

Hearing Andersen is derived from music from a Danish TV production of H.C. Andersen's The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep. It is at least variegated, combining Tchaikovsky-like rhapsodizing with modern-sounding effects. It is also completely without any discernible structure or any redeeming qualities - music hardly comes less inspired or interesting than this, and it adds up to a rather painfully boring 27 minutes. Shadow sounds like a surreal take on late romanticism and impressionism, and although that may sound prima facie appealing I can assure you that there is nothing appealing about the results. In short, these two works are as dreary, hollow and uninspired as music comes.

Things improve somewhat with the symphony, which is a darkly pugnacious fantasy of flittering shadows. It is far less accessible than the other works - in fact, it adopts an uncompromisingly dodecaphonic idiom, but at least there are some modestly interesting ideas in it. Overall, however, it is about as inspired as its inspiration (the four elements - air, earth, fire, water) would suggest. I have no objections to the performances, which are technically adept and full-blooded (although one sometimes gets the impression that the players and conductors are thinking ""why on earth am I playing this"" just as much as the listener is wondering ""why on earth am I listening to this""). The sound is generally fine if sometimes a little constricted. In sum, the symphony may be of some interest to the specialist; the rest is drivel.",0,0.0

Firstly the rating I have given does not, in anyway, reflect on Leonard Cohen or the Songs themselves. the major issue I have are with some of the artists chosen.

I doubt very much that Leonard has had any input to the artists chosen.

Another problem is in the quality of the pressing of the CD, which is atrocious, with inconsistencies throughout. To be quite honest it sounded very much like an old Vinyl LP, with 'scratches' and interference in most of the songs.

I will not provide any feedback on the artists who have given a wonderful performance, suffice to say they were all excellent.

I had to play ""Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye"", sung by Claudine Longet, a number of times, to appreciate her voice and the sensitive and subtle way she sings. In the end I felt she gave an excellent rendition of the song.

I have no idea why the following artists were chosen, as there are other artists who would have provided a more enjoyable experience:
1. Linda Thompson did nothing for the ""Story Of Isaac"" and produced a very lacklustre rendition.
2. Eyeless In Gaza (sang ""Priests"") who I have not heard of were, to say the least, grating on my ears. Think of the sound you make when you scratch a blackboard with your nails; that pretty much says it all.
3. Susanna And The Magical Orchestra (sang ""Hallelujah""); refer to my comments for ""2."" above, plus I see no magic in the singing at all!!!
4. Phil Campbell (song ""Take This Longing"") gave a somewhat lacklustre performance.
5. I will provide feedback on The Handsome Family and Mr. David Viner as there is only two words for both, absolute rubbish.

Unfortunately, the brilliance and assertiveness of this piece is lost in this performance.  It is played too fast, with too little emphasis on the commanding passages of the music.  It reminded me of a lackluster recital piece, rather than something you would expect from a grand pipe organ in a Cathedral.

I would like to see Nut and Guillie the Kid get the props that they due. So all in all this is a pretty good album from a formerly unsigned NOLA rap Vet. Big ups Kidd 9th ward Rida Gang Ha nicca! Its a shame that the true talent does not get exposed and insteand you associate most of his hottest songs with garbage lil Weezy. Like Ms Officer was a KID thang, and Neck of the Woods was a Guille joint.

I remember when a rap style was like a finger print. When you opend your mouth to spit from the first bar you could tell yea thats a Pac verse or you tryin to sound to much like 2Pac or Spice 1. Kinda like when everybody said BG stole his style from Magnolia Slim. Even BG had to mention it in one of his older songs. Point is Nut does not sound like nobody else except the few instances where he sounds like Lil Wayne, but I guess so because he wrote a lot of lil Wayne verses. Rap has been murdered and drowned in hype, but at least Nut is staying real ya dig. Big ups. Bring Rap Back like the Eddie Bow.",1,0.0

2759,"Mailley-Smith specializes in Romantic repertoire, which he plays most deliciously, sometimes a little flamboyantly, always Romantically. It's hard not to like his pianistic technique, although some listeners may find it too fanciful, too dramatic, too ostentatious; too much playing to the audience, if you will. Certainly, no one can accuse him of not being virtuosic, though. He is a most-skilled practitioner of the art, with the kind of poetic style that may seem old fashioned in an age of clarifying, analyzing, and elucidating every note. It seems to me that the best pianists--Pollini, Ashkenazy, Perahia, Argerich, Brendel, Kovacevich, Rubinstein, Gilels, Richter, Michelangeli, Janis, et al--generally combine the two approaches. We'll see how Mailley-Smith proceeds in his career, and whether he can equal what only a handful of pianists have already accomplished.

That said, there's a lot to like here.

Mailley-Smith opens the program with the Fantasie Impromptu No. 4, Op. 66, an excerpt from which you can hear below. The track pretty much exemplifies everything the man does on the disc. It's lush and it's plush, and it will blow your house down. Not that it's slow or lackadaisical, however; indeed, it is fleet and surefooted. It's just that Mailley-Smith so caresses each note, it sounds as though he's making love to the instrument (a Steinway model D). This is not only Romantic piano playing, this is a romance between the performer and the music. It's quite hypnotic, actually.

And so it goes through fourteen items on the disc, each one played in a smooth, flowing, polished, yet thoroughly engaging manner. Mailley-Smith performs with flourish and sensitivity, pointing up every ornate contrast the composer has to offer.

With the exception of just a few items, the numbers on the album duplicate the program presented on pianist Idil Biret's very fine collection of favorites for Naxos. So, I had a good comparison there without having to dive into five or six different CD collections of nocturnes, waltzes, etudes, etc. And what I can say is that Mailley-Smith acquits himself very well next to his older compatriot, matching Ms. Biret in virtuosity and sensitivity and surpassing Naxos's slightly clearer but edgier sound. While it is still open to question whether Mailley-Smith will ever match Pollini or Rubinstein in Chopin, we shall see, but he's off to a promising start.

The Nocturne No. 2 in D flat, Op. 27 is as creamy and dreamy as anyone could wish for. The Etude No. 8 in F major, Op. 10, nicknamed ""Sunshine,"" is all bright light and sunny skies. The famous Prelude No. 15, Op. 28, ""Raindrop,"" exudes the sort of beauty you want, with a wholly appropriate gentleness of touch. The ""Minute Waltz"" comes through with flying colors, and sounds less breathless by the end than we sometimes hear it. Then, there's a degree of melancholic dignity in the Waltz No. 2 in C sharp minor, Op. 64 that's refreshing.

Interestingly, both Mailley-Smith and Biret open and close their programs with the same two selections, the aforementioned ""Fantasie"" Impromptu and the Ballade No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23. Just as interesting is Mailley-Smith's inclusion of the Souvenir de Paganini, a delightful little set of variations one doesn't often encounter. It rounds out a program that quite won me over. Mailley-Smith provides the kind of Romantic expressiveness that makes him a crowd pleaser.

If I have any minor argument with the disc, it's that it provides less than an hour (55'05) of content. Surely, the pianist has other favorites he could have included, or was it a matter of cost considerations in recording? I don't know, and it's a small matter in any case.

Good, realistic piano sound, too.

2770,"Some artists fall into a rut; they find a niche and stick with it. Megan Slankard is not that type of artist. With ""A Token of the Wreckage"", Megan's four release and third full-length production, she has evolved and is finally hitting her stride. From a young girl with a guitar, she developed the ability to fully orchestrate a song with nothing but her own hands and voice, but even that was too limiting for this artist. Now with a stable backing band of Danny Blau on rhythm guitar and keyboards, Kyle Caprista on percussion and backing vocals, James Deprato on lead guitar and bay area stalwart Jeff Symonds laying down solid bass lines Megan has the ability to fully realize the orchestration she hears in her head.

Many songs found on ""Token"" have been part of her live repertoire for three or more years, making them sound effortless even when wrapped in lilting guitars, complex harmonies and solid percussion while Megan's voice floats above. The overall effect is well engineered, if slightly restrained in comparison to a live performance.

2802,"Don't get me wrong: the musicians are of prime quality, the repertoire is well chosen and I'd really whished to enjoy this CD. The single star goes entirely for the musicians, and I hope I can get the original CD someday. However, there are too many problems with this product.

1. This is a recorded CD-R, which is less durable than an pressed CD. Yes, Amazon warns about that. What they don't tell you is that what you get is nothing more then a CD with a tracklist. No booklet, no texts, no artist photos -- nothing. In the MP3 version (available at amazon.de as well as the original pressed CD) you can at least have some extra information from the tags in the files. Here you get nothing: if you don't search the internet for a picture of the back cover, you can't even know who composed each piece. What you get here, for the price of a full CD, is only a wax color low resolution single sheet with the track names on it, as if you printed it from a directory listing. The least expected was a high-res reproduction of the original CD covers, front and back, as weel as the booklet. Instead, you can't even figure out who composed each piece and which tracks constitute the pieces. If you do not get a booklet, what is the purpose of buying the CD instead of the digital version?

2. The artists in this recording are or prime grandeur, so I cannot imagine the distortions I hear all over the tracks are the product of a bad sound engineering. This must have something to do with this new recorded-on-demand process. Track 24 is a complete messs, with the high frequency of the violins and harpsichord screaming over the solo and ruining the otherwise great performance. This is not worth the 16 USD I payed for the CD. I'd rather pay the 22 EUR they charge at amazon.de than have a crippled copy comparable only to a low quality pirate CD.

If all the CDs produced on demand are like this one, Amazon is in trouble. Since I only listened to this CD after returning to Brazil, I will not bother returning this item, but I hope this review serves as a warning to other buyers. Buy the original CD, not this crippled fake. The performance is very good, and the musicians deserve their praise.

I originally thought the band members originated out of the states, I was gonna be kind, say it's a language gap... but no, they're from Maine. Inexcusable drivel. I now dislike this album more knowing that.

This compilation has Medieval music (eg. Cantigas, Oswald von Wolkenstein, Landini) and early Baroque (eg. Monteverdi).  More surprisingly, I found many unfamiliar pieces.  I had never heard of these pieces such as Georg Bhm, Melchior Borchgrevinck ...  It is a good chance to know these pieces. However, be careful.  I don't think these are the essential Renaissance masterpieces.  This album lacks early Renaissance music especially early English (eg. Dunstable, Eton choirbook, Tallis), Burgundian school (eg, Dufay) , many important Flemish school compmosers and pieces (too many!), and Iberian composers (Tomas Luis de Victoria, Milan).

Overall, it has lots of fan, but not a good overview of so-called ""Renaissance music"", particularly for beginners.",1,1.0

2858,"Like many people, my first encounter with the 'music' of this young man followed a conviction for violence against a woman. Little surprise then, that this album if packed full of explicit references and veiled pornographic imagery - yet aimed squarely at kids and teenagers. The song 'wet the bed' is downright appalling.  A sad indictment of the current state of the music industry that the worlds most famous record label RCA, allowed this to be released.

In June 2010, Chris Brown's application for a visa to enter the UK was refused on the grounds of him ""being guilty of a serious criminal offence"". This followed criminal convictions that included a violent assault on a female pop star. Brown got lucky and was sentenced to five years of probation, one year of domestic violence counselling, and six months of community service; the judge retained a five-year restraining order on Brown, which requires him to remain 50 yards away from [the victim] Rihanna, 10 yards at public events.

It is with the above publicity that I learn about this 'singer' and I spend several hours sampling the album - trying to find out what the fascination is.

This individual sounds like a third rate karaoke version of a young Michael Jackson. This is 'painting by numbers' music. The tracks sound like they are straight off a studio factory assembly line. Unimaginative and repetitive references to 'make you love me' and 'i'm gonna do x,y,z to you' this is not music I would allow children to come within a mile of.

More mature artists perform this genre with a level of authenticity. This just sounds very young & amateurish.

The track 'Next To You' proves that Brown has some singing ability. How edited the track is, I do not know, but he can clearly sing. It only proves how utterly murky the whole situation is. Underneath the anger, the violence, the bad influences, there is probably a talented young man. Possibly, but I doubt there is enough talent to save this sorry character from a further life of crime.",0,1.0

2878,"I have been listening to Curtis Fuller since first hearing him on the legendary John Coltrane album Blue Train. He has always been an innovator and a trombonist's trombone player. He is also a wonderful composer and arranger. This recording lacks everything I have grown accustomed to when hearing Mr. Fuller and I am astounded it was even released. The piano is out of tune, the sound quality and mixing are amateurish and the playing is substandard throughout. The heads are misplayed and so are many of the chord changes. It makes me ask, did they actually have the charts or were they playing from memory? I cannot believe Curtis Fuller had anything to do with this recording and I doubt he knew they were recording his stories for release. I adore his 2010 release, ""I Will Tell Her"" which was also dedicated to his late wife Cathy. Before buying this CD or MP3s, please find a way to hear it first. A lot of music critiques are a matter of opinion and some listeners may like this recording. Anyone with an ear for jazz will (or should) run shrieking from the room upon hearing this horrible CD.

(look it up.  if you listen to this song, you'll probably have to look that word up.)  and the chord sequence is just about as sophisticated as the lyrics are (and her voice is very nasal - not fair to all those amazing vocalists out there).  how does such crap (i started to say mediocrity, but that would be 2-3 stars) get promoted?
This is why it's so funny in The Newsroom.  love that show!  Five stars for that one.

This is quite possibly the worst thing ever made by man. Rebecca Black cannot sing. She opens her mouth and out comes noise. This is a tune that will haunt your sleeping hours...and your waking ones. The music video is equally abysmal, showing all the artistic talent of a young, hyperactive teen's first foray into television.

This song should come with a disclaimer. Listen to it in public and you invite yourself to heroic bystanders coming to the aid of the general public and tackling you to the ground. Listen to it in private and you subject yourself to seizures, headaches, and temporary memory loss.

How can I lack or e'er have need?

In pastures green He makes me lie.
My soul He satisfies always,
The restful water leads me by,
In fellowship and perfect peace.

I often stray; He seeketh me
To yield my heart to His control.
For His name's sake He leadeth me
And shepherds my oft-shaken soul.

Incredible the thought beside--
Pursuing Thee all care is stilled.
Thy rod and staff support and guide;
My way is with Thy presence filled.

Emboldened in Thy victory,
I feast surrounded by my foes,
My head anointed bountifully,
My cup with blessings overflows.

I don't know the various relatives of the Carters, but this was recorded in stereo, thus had to be at least late fifties, sounds like the seventies (electric guitars and a Bobby Goldsboro tune). There are no liner notes, just song titles and no song writers. It was made in the Czech Republic, so maybe they have no idea who these people are (is this the family that lived in the White House in the seventies?). The music's not bad, but I'd sure like to know which generation of the Carters is singing (third removed nephews and nieces?).

3049,"I am a fan of subliminal programs although not of brainwave binaural beat programs, and I bought this one to motivate me to try a French language course. However, I must say I am tired of subliminal CD's and MP3's that do not let the buyer know what messages they will be receiving in their music, nature sound, or ""silent"" programs. Silent? Does that mean homeopathic subliminal, ie-nothing in it?
A list of the suggestions would be especially nice on the subliminals that cannot be heard over music, nature sounds, etc.. This is one of those programs-ocean sounds to learn french. But it does not say crave french language studies,  learn/adapt to French more easily, or actually learn the language, ok, clearly the last one-not. Should one listen during studies,at night, before study, after study, what is the purpose? Also, if this is a brainwave or binaural it should be labled as such.
Now here is the truth, the most one can hope for in subliminal language learning programs is to heighten the desire to learn the language, take a class in the language, or heighten the ability of the listener to learn or develop linguistic skills when they are in classes, working the speech lab, or using a language course/album. This album lacks a description of which type of message you are getting.
Although this is a pleasant sounding program, nice ocean sounds, etc., I prefer the types of programs where one can audibly hear the suggestions even if only as a whisper in the background. Also, whether I can hear the message audibly or not, I cannot see why the makers of these programs are unwilling to provide a description on the site of the messages used in the programs. Some of the programs I purchased for weight loss were nicely effective after a couple of weeks. They had audible messages in the programs and lots of reviews.
I have not yet gone 2 weeks with this program, but a similar program I purchased for another issue with ocean waves and no audible message has not been effective. My husband said at this price just try it. I gave it two stars for having really soothing sounds. If if works I will update the review. I will try it but it is time to get message descriptions on these subliminal MP3's &CD's. If you listen to the previews, some of them are great, some are not informative of content other than a title, some include binaural programs but don't say that on the covers/titles, some are simple meditation programs, some appear to be scientology subliminals,& others are downright weird.

Vital's voice reminds me of Kid Cudi, though his lyric work is simplified, mellow. He ""ooh""s and ""ahh""s quite a bit, and I can hear his voice over a Telepopmusik track. Neither bad things, mind you.

The five songs travel from relaxed and atmospheric (Saying) to bubbly (Going Back) to radio-friendly, rock-ish songs (Read It and Airport).

3107,"The first time I heard ""Ring of Fire"" it was a version by June Carter Cash.  I hated it.  Hated everything about it, from the country twang and plodding beat to the cryptic yet sappy lyrics to Carter's painful-to-listen-to singing voice.  Johnny Cash's interpretation wasn't much better with mariachi band overtones, but at least his voice was easy on the ears (as is the original release by Anita Carter, June's younger sister).

When I first heard Adam Lambert's cover, I had no idea it was even the same song.  Pitched in a minor key with middle eastern overtones, Lambert's musical phraseology breathes new life into the previously incomprehensible lyrics.  In fact, they are so sensual that I took some time to research the song to see if he changed any of them.  While I didn't discover any significant changes by Lambert, it seems there is an urban legend that Cash actually wrote the song but gave Carter credit for it so it wouldn't get tied up in his upcoming divorce from his first wife, and that the phrase ""ring of fire"" is a reference to female genitalia.

If you love the Adventures of Ford Fairlane it a must have
I came across the cd soundtrack around 1996 in a used cd, vhs, video games Store
I know at the time i over payed $9.99 give or take but, it was just very cool to find this cd
Since i loved the film I mostly got it for
Cradle of Love but, this soundtrack is really good top to bottom
It's a strong album to a film that came and went due to various special interest groups, etc,
(See my Love letter to the Adventure of Ford Fairlane Blu Ray)

Track Run down listing is as follows:
1.  Cradle of Love (Performed by Billy Idol) you can know gets this song on Billy Idol's Greatest Hits Album
2.  Sea Cruise (Performed by Dion it's a so/so cover.  now it's sounds a bit dated Not the worst cover though!
3. Funky Attitude (Performed by Shelia E.) Still a very good sounding pop song it makes me wonder where Shelia E really went the chick can sing!
4. Glad to be Alive  (Performed by Teddy Pendergrass & Lisa Fisher)  Awesome SOng!!!!!  this track alone should make any music fan pick up this cd not sure if you can get this on mp3.... Great simple song but, it's so good perfect song! I'd love to know if Electra Records ever tried to push this song as a Radio Single it's really good
5. Can't Get Enough  (Performed by Tone Loc)  this is the track on the cd that dates this entire cd doesn't hold up terrible song
6. Rock 'N Roll Junkie  (Performed by Motley Crue) Great Rock song I'm pretty sure you can find this song on other BO Albums too though
7.  I Ain't Got You (Performed by Andrew Dice Clay) Not terrible but, it's a novelty song
was there smoke and mirrors during the studio time while he did his vocals??? maybe? maybe not??? people forget The Dice man use to be able to Mimic people like Sylvester Stallone,  and John Travolta
8. Last Time In Paris  (Performed by Queensryche)
9. Unbelievable (Theme from ""Ford Fairlane""  performed by Yellow
10.  The Wind Cries Mary  (Performed by Richie Sambora)  another cover but, a HQ cover this is another song that makes this cd a must have

You can still snatch this for a pretty cheap price
It's without a doubt worth it

C.C. DeVille was thrown-out of the band publicly and grunge rock was becoming the flavor of the week

They went from Glam rock band to a stripped down blues rock band
Not nearly as cringe inducing as when Staind's Aaron Lewis went from heavy metal to country
The album itself is average but, has four very amazing tracks on it non the less
""Stand""
""Body Talk""
""Theatre of the Soul""
""Until You Suffer Some (Fire and Ice)""

""Theatre of the Soul"" is  a break-up song about former guitarist C.C. DeVille  and it's down right sad and beautiful at the same time
It's on the same level as the likes of ""Every Rose has It's Thorn"" and ""Give me Something to Believe In""
 You wouldn't know this was Poison in 1993 it's amazing and was never pushed as a single wish makes no sense

I'm sure most rock/ hair metal fans missed Native Tongue due to the likes of Temple of the Dog, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Alice In Chains,
Soundgarden taking over the music scene but, the four tracks i brought up should be discovered and cherished

3168,"I've been a fan of Thursday for years. They can't do wrong in my eyes. I love all their albums. Ever since I got this album I've played it non-stop daily. That's how amazing it is.

The instrumental on Turnpike Divides is awesome. Hearing them play this song live is even better. I just saw them along with Taking Back Sunday in concert and Geoff is an insanely good singer/performer live.

I love how Thursday changes it up on every album. They're unique that way. I don't get why some people seem to want them to make albums similar to Full Collapse or something. I just don't get how anyone hates Common Existence or ACBTLD. Both awesome in my opinion. I listen to both of those albums a lot.

3169,"I've been a fan of Thursday since I bought `Full Collapse' in 2002; I've since acquired all of their albums with my favorites being `Full Collapse' and `City by the Light Divided' and my least favorite being `Common Existence' (which still  wasn't really a bad album, just uneven).  I will say that, after 15 to 20 listens, this is their most accomplished and impressive work to date.  It really didn't hit me initially; the first couple spins didn't form any kind of opinion one way or the other and, while there wasn't anything that seemed `bad' about the music, it was just too dense to soak in right away.  But I highly recommend giving it a chance to grow on you as I guarantee you'll be just as rewarded as I was.  First, I think the production on this is by far their greatest; it's incredibly dense, multi-layered, and strikes the perfect balance of what I believe they were trying to do (and failed, in my opinion) with `Common Existence', in maintaining a dynamic of lo-fi, gritty, noisy texture with extremely technical and varied arrangements and instrumentation.  Next, one of the major surprises I'm sure many fans are going to encounter is that there really isn't much screaming on the album - maybe 30 seconds to a minute combined (and only present on 3 or 4 songs).  However, it would be incorrect to assume this is a `soft' album.  The aggression presented here is more subliminal and abstract then their prior work, which makes complete sense and is a perfect move for a band that is continuously evolving (and which is why they are still musically-relevant today even with being (unfortunately) roped into a genre that has long since died).  Take, for instance, the bridge in `A Darker Forest'; while there isn't any screaming, the music picks up after each verse with a thick riff, pounding snare and synth-bell accents, bringing to mind a passage the Swans might write, which is a fitting example of another band that understands how to create true heaviness with dynamics in more creative and minimal ways than what's usually expected.  And in regards to the drumming, this is clearly the drummer's best work.  In fact, from a musical perspective, this really is everyone's best work and it's more evident the more the CD is digested.  I wouldn't even know how to rate the songs individually as I always listen to the album in full as sequenced, which, I may add, could not be possibly arranged any better.  Overall, Thursday pushed forward again with an album that far exceeded personal expectations, especially after fearing a potential `Common Existence 2'.  It's their best work so far and has potential to go down as one of the best albums of the year, regardless of genre.",1,1.0

About the music and the performance-- Vivaldi's concertos are often fairly light music but beautiful if performed appropriately. Unfortunately, some conductors and instrumental groups like to put their own highly individual stamp upon the music they perform, and the original composers are usually dead, so are not present to protest.

These performances are melodramatic and unpleasant. The audio is artificially constrained and too soft for long passages, and then suddenly, overwhelmingly too loud. The violins and other strings, which can sound so sweet, are instead used to imbue a maximum amount of annoying, fingernails-on-the-chalkboard, screechy and grating tonality to the music, as though the conductor were trying to force Vivaldi into the mold of angst-filled German ""sturm und drang"" music, making Vivaldi into high drama, or rather, inappropriate and almost dissonant melodrama.

The musicians are superb, which makes me angry that the interpretation of this music is so idiosyncratic and in a style that I regard as inappropriate for the music and musical period. Although others may disagree, the earnest, aggressive but ill-conceived performance ruins the music, in my view.",0,0.0
3188,"I have three other Carmina Burana CDs pretty much memorized to compare this to, and have seen it performed twice in different cities.

This CD is a DDD recording of Kurt Prestel conducting the Salzbur Choir and Orchestra...

The vocalists are mostly very good performers. They enunciate. They hit the right notes. Most of them are just about perfect. But the baritone is HORRIBLE. He has no strength or focus. There are two important parts during which HE CANNOT EVEN HOLD A NOTE!! He actually takes a breath where NO one else ever needs to.

And the orchestra is small. There is no Gong during the last few seconds of O Fortuna, for example. And they sometimes sound like a High School Band. The musicians almost always hit the right notes, but they are clumsy at times, and the conductor just doesn't seem to get the feel for any of the music, or the work as a whole. The timing is way off. It's staccato too often, and way too deliberate, like a literal reading of music. It's just Not Magical OR Professional.

Technical Quality of Masters Classic CD from Holland
This DDD recording sounds hissy if you don't turn the treble down to -1, where most CDs sound best at +3 (on my car sound system). Plus some loud parts are very distorted. It actually gets much worse in the second half, which never happens on DDD recordings.

* * *

Now, if you'd like to know about the other two in my collection...

* * *

Carl Orff TRIONFI - Rundfunk Sinfonie Orcheter Leipzig

This is a 2 CD set of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana Trilogy.

After Carmina Burana, the Catulli Carmina and Trionfo di Afrodite are quite disappointing performed by anyone, but worth hearing at least once. It's just that I cannot recommend this box set for the performance of Carmina Burana.

The vocalists and orchestra perform accurately, but...

1. Several parts are sung much too fast.
2. In a few parts there is so much R rolling that it is distracting.
3. Too many parts are sung deliberately instead of joyfully.
4. It sometimes sounds angry instead of magical.

The Technical Quality is OK. The highs are bright and clear, but there is hardly any bass, and really MUCH MORE DYNAMIC RANGE ON THIS CD THAN MOST CLASSICAL CDs. This CD goes from so quiet that you cannot hear it, to so loud that it hurts the ears much too often. And again, it does this Much More than Most Classical CDs!!

The Philadelphia Orchestra, Eugene Ormandy ****

My favorite so far is not as bright and clean as the Ozawa, but is the best performance I have heard on CD. It is an older recording with The Philadelphia Orchestra led by Eugene Ormandy, and The Rutgers University Choir. Harve Presnell is the featured soloist in this performance, which is a claim to fame for my area since he went to Modesto High School. Also, if you watched The Pretender (1996-2000), he was Miss Parker's ""Daddy.""

This was the best performance over all that I have heard on CD, but if you want the best sounding CD of Carmina Burana...

* * *

The Berliner Philharmoniker, Seiji Ozawa ***

Seiji Ozawa conducting the Berliner Philharmoniker is not the very best performance, but definitely the best sounding CD of Carmina Burana that I have heard. It's bright, deep, clean, and clear with full range and no distortion. It also doesn't get too quiet in the quiet parts, and then too loud in the loud parts. That never happens on this one. It just sounds fantastic.

3190,"Nowadays I rarely hear new Mozart but here is an occurrence: this is my first encounter with K 293, the unfinished Concerto for Oboe in F. Resident in the Fitzwilliam Museum, the autograph consists of 61 measures of its opening movement. The entire ritornello and first two bars of the soloist's entrance are fully instrumented. Thence, the oboe presses on alone for the remaining eleven bars before petering into silence. The instrumentation stipulates Violins, Violas, Bass, 2 Clarinets, 2 Bassoons, 2 Horns. Chronology-wise, here is one instance where K1 was right on the money.  Einstein's attempt to reclassify the fragment as K 416f was discredited by Tyson.

The music itself is a delight. It is less perky and more pastoral than K 314. Robert Levin - the defiler of K 297b - undertook this reconstruction. If one did not know better, one would assume that Mozart had completed the work. The cadenza itself is highly inventive. Bobby, if you're reading, the Australian Knappertsbusch Association has reduced the dollar figure on your Wanted Poster from ten to five bucks and a couple of Mars Bars.

Ingo Goritzki, the soloist, has a beautiful reedy tone. I invariably find Polish ensembles to be musical to their bootstraps: the Polish Chamber Philharmonic is no exception. To fill out the program, the Flute Concerto (K 313) & the Andante for the same instrument (K 315) are transcribed for oboe and successfully so. When added to K 314, this is a generous program, stylishy and vivaciously played. The Claves recording is excellent.

From the first seconds, I was irritated. Jacques Parrenin, the violinist and leader of this ensemble, was associated a while ago with some decent recordings of Faure's chamber music. It seems he hasn't recorded anything else besides this Lalo, and it seems like justice. I now have terrific recordings of Lalo's first and third trios (by the Caecilian and Jean Martin trios)<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/French-Trios-Quartets-Debussy-Lalo-Faure-Ravel-Saint-Saens/dp/B000001K6P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">French Trios & Quartets: Debussy, Lalo, Faure, Ravel, Saint-Saens</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lalo-Sonate-Op-12-Et-Trio-Op-26/dp/B0000AKOI7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lalo: Sonate Op. 12 Et Trio Op. 26</a>, so now the Parrenin goes back to the universe, where perhaps it will find a home more receptive than mine.

3216,"What a disappointment!  I had so looked forward to having a clean version of the 1955 recording, and I thought that it would be worth the $32 splurge.  But this record, although it looks like the original Columbia 6 eye, sure doesn't sound like it.  It is mushy and lacks definition, just not right, just not beautiful.  I tried three different cartridges and 4 different styli.  I played it against the cassette I made 45 years ago from a friend's 1955 record; the cassette was noisy but far superior (and it was made with a mediocre turntable cartridge and stylus and a cheap cassette player).  I played it against the CD from A State of Wonder, that I never liked much; the CD was also far superior.  I don't know what they did wrong is engineering this record, but do not be deceived into thinking that it accurately portrays the 1955 recording.  It is in fact the worst version of the 1955 recording that I have heard.",0,0.0

3223,"When I first heard this instrumental in my teens, I thought it was a new release by my favorites, The Shadows. A cousin who was the lead guitarist of an instrumental band and who played the tune note for note told me that it was by another English band called The Fentones. After getting the 45, I tried hard to learn how to play it but didn't nail the chorus until I can slow it down with my Vox JamVox four decades later! Always been a lousy guitar player, anyway! But I love this tune and always enjoy myself listening to it. I just wish it was recorded in stereo and that would have been great. It was released as a single in my country with ""Lover's Guitar"" on the B side. This tune was in turn covered and released as a single in a much, much better version that the original sounded amateurish. I've always wondered if the songwriter(Elleen Davies)ever heard this version. She would have been delighted as legions of Filipino players made the recording the standard of their guitar playing capabilities. The band that released that recording will forever be recognized as one of the best Filipino rock bands ever, if not the best. They were The Electromaniacs, led by Mr. Ernie Delgado who is widely looked up to as the best Filipino guitar player of his generation.

It's not hard to imagine why when you consider the Swedish pop group has 29 members and quite a mix of instruments. If you want to listen to something a little bit different that makes you feel good, give 'I'm From Barcelona' a chance.

We're on a way back to our tent to ride the storm out...and in the distance, on the blues stage, this guy is just rippin' it up...soaked already, we take the detour...<lightening overhead>...

It is just us and about 25 other drenched fools and this band...this bass player, dancing like it is the end of days as he plays, a stern drummer keepin' it together and a keyboard player who knows his role and excels at it. Jarekus tapping his foot in a rain puddle on the stage next to a 4-socket extension cord. Rain steams off of his body in the heat of the stage lights. <lightening overhead>

This CD is great despite the shortcomings of the mix. Reflects the rise of the New Urban Blues (as I call it) also in view in Gary Clark Jr. and Eric Gales, and puts Jarekus Singleton squarely in that company of fine new blues talent.

Our live show had no horn section and Jarekus carried the show in an impressive electric fashion. A fine player, song writer, singer, and someone to expect great things of in the future. <crash of thunder>

3260,"Swiss melodic hard rock band ""Sahara Rain"" return in 2011 with their brand new second album ""Eternity"". The line up once again features lead singer Ricci Domenico, guitarist David Silhanek and Adrian Honegger, bassist Boet Haas and key-player Bo Rebsamen.

In comparison to its predecessor, ""Eternity"" retains the hard rock edge of the debut album while taking a considerable AOR turn. While their debut ""Sand in your hands"" drew upon German melodic hard rock, the new album comes close to the sound of Swiss melodic pioneers ""Gotthard"". For that matter, the production of the album as well as Ricci's vocals are the main points of reference for ""Gotthard""s influence on their sound; in fact, ""Sahara rain"" will definitely bring ""Gotthard"" to the experienced fan's mind once they play ""Eternity"".

Focusing onto the performances, it has to be said that `Sahara Rain's style had become substantially sophisticated; Yes, you once again get the thick riffs, the melodic guitar lines, the flawless rhythm section, and the harmonious shredding, only this time adding more keyboards into the mix. In fact, most songs are supported by piano that contributed both melodies and rhythm parts, becoming a large part of ""Sahara Rain""s sound. Songs like ""Shout it out"", ""Miss you"", ""Will I ever be"", ""Live Earth"" and ""Starlight"" uncover the musical class of ""Sahara Rain"" hence making perfectly clear that the group have effectively raised their game with this second effort.

Having played the album a good number of times, I would go as far as saying that ""Sahara Rain"" are creatively in the same league as ""Gotthard"" on account of the music found on this second effort ""Eternity"". For fans of the Swiss/German/Danish hard rock scene, ""Sahara Rain-Eternity"" is one of the best albums out there, at them moment.",1,1.0

This album takes these inventions and plays them on some weak midi program, with a disco beat backing. So, it is like ""Hooked on Classics."" Except not even as good. The sound is almost ""8bit,"" the sound that comes out of pccket video games.

They use the name ""Bachbuster,"" but do not get confused with Don Dorsey's awesome Bach-on-synth album, ""Bachbusters."" That is awesome. Dorsey throws a backing beat in there at a point or two, but his whole album is not ""Hooked On..."" Dorsey was or is an electronic music composer and arranger for Disney, and got really good  at electronic music scoring and production. So, he went and put out his own album, Bachbusters. He has probably been te only artist since Wendy Carlos and Isao Tomita to get broad attention for an album of classical music played on synthesizers. I think Bachbusters may have won a grammy. Dorsey had 2 more, as far as I know - 1 with Beethoven, and one a melange.

3418,"""Mason Records"", the label on this release, is a bootleg label. Quoting from Discogs: ""BOOTLEGS Cd reissues label. Please list the CDs as Unofficial releases. This label name is plain fantasy, there is no company behind them. Information ""Made in Geramany"", ""Digitally remastered"", Barcodes are plain tricks or gimmicks.""

The packaging on this release is poor, as is the sound quality.

In other words, if you buy this, you're buying someone's low grade attempt to copy music from legitimate releases and sell it as their own. The source of the recordings is questionable, and not a penny goes to the artists, or their label.

Since both of the recordings on this release are available, legitimately, as reissues on Collectors Choice Records, see:

3419,"Ive been a fan of Mist of Avalon since 1998 after I accidentally stumbled over the song Lost In Feelings on their self-titled Mist of Avalon CD. They had a haunting distinctive sound with influences from The Sisters of Mercy and slight touches of the Ramones here and there. I live in the USA and at that time their music wasn't available in the States so I contacted them in the year 2000 and Erik Sjlander, the guitarist, contacted me immediately. He helped me out big time, thank you Erik, and I ordered the 3 CDs they had out at the time (Mist of Avalon, Sleepless, and Here And After). In 2001 they released the CD titled Tears. It is after this that things in the band changed drastically. It wasn't until 2007 that another CD was put out titled The Mist of Avalon Limited. They no longer sounded like they did back in 2001 and earlier. Instead of the haunting vibe they morphed into a euro-pop rock sound.

The Dinya CD released in 2010 has all of the songs from The Mist of Avalon Limited CD plus 6 more songs. The CD isn't bad, but the sound is so different from their previous work I personally feel they shouldnt have used the Mist of Avalon band name when they released these last two CDs. The best song on the Dinya CD is Negri. That is the only song I like on this CD, whereas on all the previous CDs from 1998 to 2001 I like all of the songs. I attempted to contact Aram Yildiz the singer, but he did not respond. Im guessing he no longer looks at their Mist of Avalon web page anymore and has moved on to other musical interests.

In any case Dinya is a good CD if you're looking for a Euro-pop rock vibe, but if you're looking for the classic Mist of Avalon sound Id pass.",0,1.0

""Winning Hand,"" Sheri Miller's new CD, packs an emotional wallop to go along with its tuneful, impeccably produced music. I liken Sheri to my favorite female singer/songwriter, Karla Bonoff, in her fearless ability to range from the precincts of despair (""Guarded, so brokenhearted/I kept the world at bay"") to the pinnacle of joy (""Love, Love, Love, Love""). It isn't easy to channel your inner self this forthrightly, and this nakedness adds depth to ""Winning Hand's"" hit-potential pop-rock (""Spoons,"" ""Everybody Feels This Way Sometimes""). With this lovely, assured CD, Sheri Miller is pushing all her chips in on the river card. I wouldn't bet against her, if I were you!",1,1.0
3465,"This is a great, catchy song, that came from a popular YouTube video.  It's a Miley Cyrus take-off (pre-twerking, but very much post-Disney Miley) that also used video footage from Snoop Dogg (pre-Snoop Lion, I think).  The lyrics are less interesting than some of BLR's other work, but otherwise very much inline with what BLR usually does:  goofy, crass, but catchy.  However, the beat is one of BLR's best and the weird impression of Snoop is pretty great in its own way.

If you're not familiar with Bad Lip Readings (""BLR""), the idea is that the author, who can read lips, used to joke with friends that people looked like they were saying ridiculous things if you were only mediocre at reading lips (or if you were joking around and trying to misread what they were actually saying).

The BLR author took that concept and ran with it, making various political, movie, and music videos where he used actual footage from politicians, movie scenes, and music videos.  For music videos, the BLR author would also make a new musical track and do his own impressions of the artist (or maybe he has friends do the impressions, I don't know).  However, in place of the real words of the song, the BLR author added goofy words that either made little to no sense but were amusing (like this song's lyric ""Tiny Timmy Tokyo"" or the song ""Shoot a Russian Unicorn"") or were otherwise just ridiculous (like the line ""Let's buy two industrial windmills"" from this song, or ""You slapped a fiiiiish"" from a Twilight BLR).  The BLR replacement words are generally very entertaining, and the impressions sound pretty good but still have their own interesting style.

However, a funny thing happened when he was making the goofy music videos:  they turned out to be really good songs on their own.  The beats are impressive, the tunes are fun, and the tracks overall are very catchy.  So while you would probably be fairly confused if you heard this song without knowing what it was, you might still find yourself singing it later.

I highly recommend BLR's songs to others.  They're fun, catchy, and worth a listen.  I can only hope that, like Weird Al's stuff, BLR can work with authors and create more great BLR music videos.  (At least some artists, like Michael Bubl, think what he did with their songs is hiliariousBubl has a YouTube response praising the BLR ""Shoot a Russian Unicorn."")",1,1.0

3469,"Like so many offbeat or experimental bands, each successive release by Gang Gang Dance finds them sporting a progressively accessible sound. ""Eye Contact,"" GGD's fourth proper album, is not only accessible, it's ""pleasant."" Compared to their past work--even immediate predecessor ""Saint Dymphna""--this is practically Easy Listening music for them; spacey synths undulating through leanly arranged melodic numbers, each track flowing perfectly into the next as if it were a Paul Oakenfold mix.

Is this cause for panic amongst the GGD fan base? Hopefully not. While this one certainly is as smooth as a whale's tail, the spacey feel is closer to Cocteau Twins than Enya or Moby. And it's still inimitably, unabashedly, a Gang Gang Dance creation. As with past albums, percussion still takes precedence here, so ""Eye Contact"" is not some dippy trance mix; it has some great rhythms, from the crashing dubstep of ""MindKilla"" to the skittering ""Sacer"" to the thunderous stomp of ""Thru and Thru."" And Lizzie Bougastos is as colorful a vocalist as ever, turning ""Adult Goth"" into a stoner-friendly Bollywood anthem. That may sound silly, but the song's beauty and emotional heft totally transcend any campy trappings such a reference might hold. Such is the power of Gang Gang Dance.

The seamless synthetic approach to the album's production does give ""Eye Contact"" a deceptive feeling of sameness, not to mention of fluffy superficiality. Subsequent listens, however, reveal the character behind each song. Admittedly, I was initially underwhelmed, but now I can't get enough. Similar to Stereolab's ""Dot and Loops,"" an impressive and ambitious album eventually comes out of hiding. Just give it a chance, let it get to know you.",1,1.0

Thundering percussion, screaming power metal riffage and soaring solos meld the Ghibli tracks into an altogether unforgettable modern metal experience. They lose none of their melody and even keep a great deal of their original charm, helped in no small part by the dual male/female vocal combination. The male vocals are low and gutteral but perfectly listenable, we're not talking nu-metal or screamo and the female vocals, lead on most tracks, are still very sweet, girlish and deliciously kawaii ^^ , riding beautifully over the metal roar.

Adolescent is the only song on the entire album that anywhere near resembles Incubus. Where's the unique turn tables mixed against hard charging guitar? This CD sounds like something my Mom would listen to (shes in her late 50s). It's boring, ambiguous and nothing Incubus. People say ""well they've matured! Their sound is different."" There's a difference between maturing and changing who you are completely. Eminem has come into his own and ""matured"" his sound.....meaning he made it a better more confident rendition of who he is/was. He didn't turn to Opera and claim it's him ""maturing.""

There's no maturing to this album, if anything it's just a transition into a bad Coldplay/U2 ballad cover band. They took five years off and forgot who they were.

3561,"When it has came down to Glee, they've done some really bad covers since they've begun the T.V. last season. But what really has made it clear to me, is that when the cast does a cover song, it feels like they've taken the magic out of great songs that've been strong for others, and turned them into disgraces. That is the case with Misery, their latest song from Glee. Taking the upbeat delight from Maroon 5, and not really making it their own, hasn't been anything new to my ears. If you really want to be put out of misery, stick with the one from Maroon 5 instead. Adam Levine has a better drive with his music, than Glee does in a single note on the music scale.

3564,"Paul Lewis' Beethoven Diabelli Variations is the follow-up to Lewis' supremely acclaimed Beethoven sonata cycle. It has been as heavily hyped as the sonata set itself. I own the sonata box set, and was disappointed with much of it. Here, I hoped for better from Lewis, but came away I am even more disappointed.

The Diabelli Variations are among the most difficult piano marathon/obstacle courses in music, taxing and trying to performers and audiences alike, and capable of exposing many a pianists technical weaknesses as well as the deficiencies in interpretation and range of expression. Sadly, I don't think Lewis fared well.

On both this recording and the sonata cycle, I hear from Lewis:

-Plushly upholstered, dull-edged Beethoven.
-A big, thick, dark, heavy piano sound, that you will either like or not. I don't care for it. Lewis piano tuning (on a Steinway) and technique add to the effect.
-An approach that uses a lot of rubato and extensive use of piano effects (and I think more pedal) than most, which adds to the sludgy thickness and heaviness.
-Dull-edged centrist/middle of the road interpretation and performance. Thoughtful to the point of being overthought, and at many times lost and meandering. Often boring. Better on lyrical and hushed passages, awkward on the rest. Lacking variety in character and expression.
-Soft, rounded off legato phrasing. This is my main issue with Lewis. He resorts to slidy legato phrasing through much of the music, far beyond what is called for. Edges are blunted, rounded, and smoothed over---no chiseling, no pinpoint articulation. Musical lines, dynamics, accenting, and attacks are all rounded off and soft-edged (even when he is more forceful and aggressive).
- Closely miked acoustic that is on the boomy side, further accentuating thickness, fuzziness, and heaviness.

Some of Lewis playing is more boisterous on the Diabellis than on the sonatas, but this is not necessarily for the better. Both his performance and recorded sound strike me as heavy-handed and limited expressively. There is awkward lumbering in some passages where deftness and agility is demanded, meandering in others, and some passages where he is just leaden. Midrange and mushy, and at worst, almost unctuous.

Im a fan of the approach that in theme and variations, the opening theme is usually something quaint, therefore it should either be performed relatively straight or tongue in cheek, to set the stage. Or it must be done with flair and attitude. Lewis does neither. He starts by bullrushing through it, and with legato, charmlessly. And then promptly, starting with the first set of variations that should boldly announce itself with attitude and wit, he is dull and leaden (and legato), and pretty much stays there for dozens more.

I took issue with Lewis phrasing and rubato on the sonatas, and how too many of the movements seemed to be too similar in character, and here on the Diabellis, I hear much of the same again. Especially for this work, there has to be clear delineation and character in each movement, but it all sounds too alike. The fact that he runs many of the variations together without pause doesnt help matters. Things don't improve much as each variation passes by. More legato.

Lewis is better in the most hushed and quiet variations, but still manages to make these sound less than riveting. Most importantly, there is a lack of movement to movement connection---a point of view--- that is essential to maintaining a listeners focus all the way through this massive, tricky work. At times, Lewis seems to go off on tangents, lost in the woods. There are dead spots, including in the all-important final variations, where poignancy is required.

It did not take me long to lose interest in this performance.

It reminded me of Andrei Vieru's version, which was also big and (too) legato-edged.

To be fair, there are many recordings of the Diabellis that, for various reasons, also fall short. It is tough work to pull off. Some interpreters, including big names, also have a bad legato habit. So Lewis' version has a lot of unfortunate company.

Compared to Lewis version, Piotr Anderszewskis 2000 recording of these same Diabelli Variations is a huge breath of fresh air that I turn to for relief. Anderszewskis idiosyncratic version is well known and appropriately viewed as a reference, so comparisons are inevitable. I hear far more fine detail, crispness, wit, depth and insight with Anderszewskis. Every variation is distinct and different, as they should be. More importantly, Anderszewski did a better job holding my attention through the entire work, while Lewis did not.

Besides Anderszewski, there are good number of other performances of the Diabellis that I prefer, each with better energy, expressiveness and clarity. They include Filippo Gorini, Vladimir Feltsman, Ingrid Andsnes, Laurent Cabasso, Christian Leotta, Igor Levit, and Martin Helmchen among more recent recordings, and also Richter, John O'Conor, and Alfred Brendel (Lewis' mentor), just to name a few others. I like William Kinderman's recording, and there is a deluxe edition reissue that includes a lecture. Gorini, whose astounding Diabelli recording is in many ways what Lewis' should have been, is also a Brendel student. (Let's see what happens to him from here.) Pier Paolo Vincenzi's set on Brilliant Classics features both Beethoven's and the 51 other variations of other composers. So there are a lot of interesting alternatives to Lewis'.

Can I recommend Paul Lewis version to anyone? If you like legato, a thick warm piano sound, and velvety dull-edged approachable Beethoven, Lewis might satisfy you.

For more jaded ears, who have heard a lot of the predecessors and expect the very highest and deepest in Beethoven, you may, as I do, find Lewiss Beethoven to be a frustrating mixed bag.",0,0.0
3565,The live recording of the Diabelli Variations by Grigory Sokolov is amazing. It took me a long time to track down a recording of this work that I'm entirely satisfied with.

3619,"How to understand Malcom X? Go to the source!
Each of these speeches needs to be heard and taken alone with enough time for contemplation. Why? Playing these one after another will only stoke anger. Contemplation of MalcomX's and knowing the timeframe he gave these speeches gives one a sense of hope: When Malcom X gave these early speeches Kennedy hadn't set forth the road that would lead to Johnson's Civil Rights Acts. There was no hope. Water fountains were segregated to white and 'colored'. Bathrooms as well. We don't have them (as much) now but department stores such as Woolworth (think Walgreens and Target) had cafes where no 'colored' people were allowed to sit & have a (Starbucks) coffee with a croissant. These were not gang members wearing bandanas of a certain color and having tattoos on their faces scaring little children ->served today with a smile. These were women who might have worked on the NASA program that launched John Glenn into space & they couldn't order let alone sit and drink a cup of coffee let alone have lunch at these department stores in the south. In the north, where Malcom X was in Harlem, it was more subtle - with rents for apartments and pricing differences. Those were the times. Malcom X was aligned with Elijah Mohammed of the Nation of Islam after serving time in jail. He freely admits he was not a good person. It was the Muslim religion that saved him (in the late 50's). When he got out of prison he became the spokesman for the Harlem unit while Elijah Mohammed was out in Los Angeles. Tensions came between them as Malcom X became the more quoted, more sought after face of the Nation of Islam by the Main stream media & when there was a shooting of a Nation of Islam follower by white police, Malcom X wanted escalation where Elijah Mohammed did nothing & According to the Smithsonian special ""The Lost Tapes - Malcom X"" 2018, this was the first crack in the relationship. In 1963 Elijah Mohammed does not want Malcom X involved with the civil rights movement. Too late. Its already happened. Next came the Kennedy assassination & Elijah Mohammed wanted nothing said. Malcom X was stopped by the press and asked about the shooting & whereas he said nothing about that he did speak to the press which got him a 90 day suspension from giving speeches. He tried to comply but again the press came and tried to confirm the 90 day suspension, Malcom X gave a glib answer and Elijiah Mohammed/Nation of Islam extended the 90 days to which Malcom X decided to leave for his turn at Mecca. While there, he noted that many white people were also Muslim & it changed his thinking so that he came back, split up with Elijah Mohammed, started his own foundation and finally reached out to Martin Luther King Jr. who he had previously pilloried relentlessly for being too soft on his Ghandi like approach. In the end, Nation of Islam had had enough and three of their followers shot him at the beginning of one of his speeches. He was rushed to the hospital where he died. If you want to hear his own thoughts (EARLY in his own development of what it means for the human condition as these were prior to his trip to Mecca and his full conversion to Sunni Muslim belief of inclusion) verbalized then this source is 100% optimal and can't be matched by text.",1,1.0

It's kind of a departure from the rest of the album, which doesn't rely as much on dissonance.  Of course, this sort of song symbolizes why Of Montreal is so interesting in the first place.

3662,"Game covers aren't a rarity (just check out OCRemix.org), but high quality, faithful interpretations of game music are few and far between.  So often they go into the realms of badly cheesy and terribly modulated synth, in the expectation that, since it's better than a triangle, two squares and a noise channel, it's ""good"", and since gamers are a goofy bunch, we'll love goofy renditions.

Project X doesn't fall into either of these traps; the challenges posed by the skeletal framework of good instrumental music provided by the Mega Man 2 soundtrack are taken seriously in this album.

One of my favorites, ""Crash Man"", invokes a futuristic funk that was totally not present in the orignal, but is both completely compatible with it, with a crunchiness that helps recall the frustrations of that level in the game.  Even in the most synthy of the tracks, ""Metal Man"", the heavy ""wah"" effect used on the synth melody is carefully orchestrated to match the intonation of the tune.  ""Air Man"", another favorite, is brilliant in its simplicity - it uses synth more or less equivalent to the original, but adds a D&B track that reinvents the whole thing.

I give this a four stars because while I love - LOVE - this album, I recognize that some of that is nostalgia for the game.  There is, however, so much more to it than just being a cover of an awesome game.

Incidentally, this - as well as their earlier cover of Mega Man 3 - used to be available free online.

3667,"I'm a fan of Rihanna. I'm a fan of Britney. A Rihanna song featuring Britney should be amazing, right? Well, something got lost in translation, because this is not what I was expecting. Let's see what went wrong:

-The song: S&M was not built for repetition, and as such was already a bit tired when this remix came out. Without any sort of change in beat, this seems like a loose use of the word 'remix'.

-Britney: I always used to make excuses for Britney, but lately I've given up. She sounds like she has a cold while underwater, and that just doesn't sell this song at all. In fact, it takes all the sexiness (there wasn't a ton to begin with) and sucks it bare.

Here's what went right:

-Rihanna: The 'Na Na Na's don't seem to ever get old, and that growl she adds to certain bits is quite nice.

-Britney: The fact that Britney is on a Rihanna song earns this two stars by default. Her delivery on certain lines is also pleasing, in a way that only Britney can sometimes deliver (see the pronunciation of 'hazy' on 'Hold It Against Me').

It's pretty obvious that this was a ploy to get S&M to number one on Billboard, and it worked. Both the song and this remix will likely fade and not be remembered amongst either of these women's greatest achievements. For now, it's kind of a nice novelty to hear on the radio, but that's it.",0,0.0

3674,"Huge disappointment.  I am able to promote the parent album (""These Hopeful Machines"") to fellow audiophiles but casual listeners are not geared for 10 minute song arcs.  I was anticipating using this as a bridge.  Unfortunately ""Humble"" guts the first three songs.  Their mixes/arrangements are baffling.  As tho someone imported MP3s and spliced them up in Garageband.  The transitions spike all over the place.  The remaining song tweaks are okay but many have the advantage of previous mixes.

To complain more specifically, if the original ""Emergency"" had its final 3 minutes faded out and its first 2 minutes mixed (properly) down to 30 seconds the nature of the song would have been retained.  That would have left it at about 6 minutes.

""The Emergency"" is my favorite song in ... years.  Past 5 at least.  The mix on ""Humble"" fails the song.  I will keep pointing others to the original.",0,0.0

3692,"Amy Schumer's act is completely shock value. There is no getting around that. But she delivers it perfectly so it's hilarious. Her timing is perfect. The way she delivers the hidden punch line softly after the louder set up without pause is just perfect.

It's also REALLY dirty. So if you're an easily offended precious snowflake you might want to skip Amy Schumer. If you have no sense of humor you will not enjoy this at all. Her entire act is built around sex jokes, hardships of being a woman jokes, hating other women jokes, religious jokes, and ethnicity jokes. So pretty much every hot button topic that's liable to make easily offended people angry.

As for this album, one of the best things about it is that it doesn't need the video to make it funny. Some stand ups using facial expressions and body language has huge parts of their act, so the audio only version doesn't work as well. Amy Schumer's act works fine in an audio only version. The only exception is the very last joke on the album. She does something the audience can see that they apparently find hysterical, but the joke is completely lost with this audio only version. That's the only instance though.

When she does her bit about how she's Jewish and a Christian tries to tell her about Jesus.......let me just say it's one of the funniest things I've ever heard in a stand up act. I don't want to spoil the punch line but it's in track 7. If you listen to nothing else....check that track out. It happens near the end of the track.

Next to ""Total Eclipse"" released on Blue Note, this recording is my favorite of the Land - Hutcherson collaborations. The one star is definitely not for the music, but for the sound. Obviously, they had access to master tapes because they found an extra track that wasn't on the original LP. Either the master tapes were in bad shape or the remastering engineer just didn't know what he was doing. I don't mind tape hiss. It's part of the whole analogue domain, but Harold's tenor sounds rather grainy and you can hear wow, flutter and way too much tape hiss. Some of the tracks sound like the transfers were from cassette tapes. I know many of you hard core fans of this group are going to buy the cd because of the extra track (""Dark Mood""). It is a delightful track well worth checking out. Otherwise, buyer beware. I see on Amazon that there's another version of this same cd. I'm not sure if the sound is any better or if it's another knock off of the same thing. Your best bet is to search Ebay or Discogs for a LP copy. It sounds a 100 times better than this cd.",0,0.0

3701,"Along with the Mass in b and the Passions, the Christmas Oratorio deserves to be one of Bach's best works. It demonstrates to me how intelligent he was musically in putting a piece (any piece of any genre) together, using particular instruments to add sensitivity and color. And so, 150 minutes go by with not one of boredom. Moreover, hardly any baroque composer can make you weep as Bach does.
I am writing this because, after reading other reviews (some of which, sorry, are so absurd as to deem them inappropriate -- check the one star with the comment!) I have to strongly disagree with the appreciation of the solo singing. For that, I suppose you have to hear other versions; even the old ones fare better there. Specifically, I could barely stand the 'alto' of Michael Chance. He was not in good voice here. The high notes are dry and the lows cannot be controlled very well (I was screaming for a Janet Baker to appear). And: I DO NOT dislike countertenors, mind you. Pity. Maybe we have been spoiled in the last thirty years with outstanding countertenors?
I did not find much outstanding in the other singers, Kooy (the bass) and Crook (the tenor) are solid and Schlick left me cold (this time). Given the year (1989) they were possibly starting their long Bach career and did better afterwards (as my vast Bach cantata collection shows).
The above notwithstanding, the rest is quite wonderful. Conductor, pacing, baroque orchestra, choir. Plus truly outstanding, state-of-the-art sound. For all that, there goes my 4-star count.",1,1.0

3720,"Some standouts that are well done, but for the most part there aren't many genuine ""alt country"" groups contributing to this album.  I bought this because the track line up is a literal ""best of"" collection for my favorite Stone's tracks, but aside from Sweet Virginia, Dear Doctor, You Got the Silver, Coming Down Again, and a few others, there isn't much of that genuine country blues groove or feel.  My favorite Stones song of all time, Torn and Frayed, sounds painfully awkward and robotic, completely missing that fantastic loose vibe and rich fullness of the original. Streets of Love made me wonder if I should have had a Care Bears backpack and Glow sticks with me before heading into the Rave that the covering artist plays.  Loving Cup sounds like it tried to be some sort of mix between the Exile version and the classic ""Drunk Version"" outtake from the Let It Bleed sessions, but without any semblance of blues or country to be found anywhere.

I appreciate the attempt to put a different spin on these timeless gems, but the name of the album is a bit misleading.  This album is long on Alt, short on Country, and devoid of the blues influence lurking behind all good country music entirely.  The Deadstring Brothers, arguably the best Country Blues ""Stones Influenced"" group since the Black Crowes, are nowhere to be found on this album, which was sorely disappointing.

Long time 'chunk fans point to the lo-fi abandon of No Pocky for Kitty or Foolish as the pinnacle of Superchunk's impressive 15 year (and counting???) arc. However, for my money, this album combines the frenetic pogo hopping style (Hyper Enough comes to mind) of their early albums with the more hypnotic, pensive sound (Eastern Terminal) that will emerge on later albums. This is a strong album from start to finish, one that I return to time and time again. It's a great place to start your collection because the band's past and future are echoed so well.",1,1.0
3729,"I know most Superchunk fans consider their debut or ""No Pocky. . ."" the best in the band's catalog, but I disagree.  While their first two albums are great, they represent Superchunk as nothing more than a great garage/punk band.  And that's not a bad thing.  But ""Here's Where The Strings Come In"" proves that Mac and the band are capable of more than just catchy, three-chord power punk.

""Silver Leaf and Snowy Tears"" starts with a mellow picking pattern and evolves into a driving rocker by the end.  ""Animated Airplanes Over Germany"" is easily one of the most complex songs the band has ever written.  I consider this album to be their peak and it does not get the attention it deserves.

If you want to dig deeper into the Superchunk catalog, beyond the immediately catchy tunes like ""Cool,"" and ""Throwing Things,"" pick up this album.  That's not to imply there aren't catchy tunes on this one, they're just not as obvious on first listen.

If you need an immediate hook, then the first track, ""Hyper Enough"" should do the trick.  But stick with the rest of the album.  These songs will grow on you quickly.",1,1.0

So for me being a major metal fan the big, heavy guitar is an enormous plus! Also, the vocals are amazing! Greg is wailing like old times and the mix is wonderful! This is the Petra I seen in the Ohio Theater in Columbus in 1984 only better...if that's possible! LOL! Also, and more importantly the anointing of God is ALL over this recording! Oil drips from every song as Jesus is lifted high and given glory! This is my new staple album and will be for a long, long time. If you haven't gotten this yet...GET IT! You won't be disappointed!

3840,"First, let me preface this by saying that Sojourn is a great ministry full of talented artists.  Isaac Watts has written some of the most inspiring hymns the church has.  Mixing these two things together can only be good.  My review has nothing whatever to do with the lyrical content of the songs - it is solid and awesome, without exception.  I'm only focusing on music here.

Like the other commenters, I really like Sojourn's music. ""Over the Grave"" was my 'gateway' to Sojourn and I was very eager to see what the second volume of Isaac Watts hymns would sound like.  Unfortunately, not being much of a blues fan, I have a really hard time getting into this album.  Aside from my own preferences, I still gave it several careful listens to write a review.  I have to conclude: this album is also not half as musically diverse as ""Over the Grave.""  It does sound earthy, as other commenters suggested - a little too earthy - and also just plain slow, boring and predictable. With one or two exceptions (""Compel My Heart to Sing""), gone are the creative, unexpected progressions of ""Living Faith"" and ""Refuge.""

Sorry, Sojourn - I deeply love a lot of your music, but where did the fire and energy go? Some of the music also hit my ears as wildly incongruous with the lyrics - ""Let the Seventh Angel Sound"" is a song about the triumph and terror of the last day, but the music sounds like a silly Blues Traveler jam session.",0,0.0

My only complaint about this CD is the conspicuous absence of the haunting 'American Nocturne.' Perhaps Ms. Beuchner will honor us with a performance of this lovely composition on a future CD. Concerning the pieces themselves, it is unfathomable to me that they are not well known. They can be heard repeatedly over time and new things are discovered with each listening. They are indeed exemplar of the times in which Suesse blossomed, nostalgic in a way, but they stand on their own and are elegant, beautiful works of art.",1,0.0

3853,"Note that the official orchestra which will play at Will and Kate's wedding will be the London Chamber Orchestra, not the orchestra featured on this recording.

You should get your first clue on the hurried assembly of this album by looking at No. 56 ""The Marriage of RIGARO.""  Um, what?  Also, after downloading, I found that quite a few of the pieces didn't have the composer's name attached.  This really wouldn't have taken long to do.  If you like to keep your classical collection cleaned up by composer, you'll have to fill them in yourself.

I highly doubt Kate would choose ""Amazing Grace,"" [track 4] complete with banjo backup for either her ceremony or reception. Just my opinion.  ""Dies Irae"" by Benjamin Britten [track 7] means ""Day of Wrath.""  Also can't imagine ever hearing this one at a wedding.  Overall, there are some random warhorses of the popular classical repertoire here, which would not make good wedding or reception music.

On to the good points.  The recording features some notable orchestras and ""The Royal Wedding Orchestra"" does a fine job, particularly on ""The Earle of Oxford's March"" and Mendelssohn's iconic ""Wedding March.""  There are some satisfying long tracks like the 1812 Overture (with cannons and church bells!) and the Emperor Waltz.  The full spectrum of musical eras is represented, from William Byrd (Renaissance) up through Vaughan Williams and Britten for the 20th Century.  It's a nice collection if you don't have these standards already, or are seeking alternate versions to possibly improve your collection.

Edited to add:  Tracks 36 and 51 are virtually identical.  Both are solo piano versions of ""Liebestraum"" by Franz Liszt.  More evidence of the sloppy nature of the compilation.

If you're seeking artists that Kate and William will be hearing, I'd suggest you look at the recordings of Claire Jones, who is the official harpist to the Prince of Wales and will be playing at the reception.  The London Chamber Orchestra also has extensive listings on Amazon.

Overall, I recommend this album at the $1.99 price.",1,0.0

Marcus Moser needs to dig deep within himself and produce something original and something that has soul.  I think it's time for him to stop making money off of Nadia Ali's older recorded songs that didn't make it into the Poetica album.

The instrumental songs on this album are really really nice, and i recommend downloading those if you are an Omnia fan, but basically all of the tracks with vocals are not good. Just plain not good. The first time i  listened to this album i didn't like it but i thought, ""hey, i'll give it another chance, afterall, it's Omnia!"" And i listened to it again two more times, and liked it less and less each time. I liked this album so little that i actually decided that it was so bad that i no longer liked Omnia at all, in light of this present incarnation! And i liked Omnia a LOT! But after a year or so after listening to this album, i have come back to Omnia and i still enjoy their other albums very much, and like i said, the instrumental tracks off of this one.

3914,"I have seen these guys back since their beginnings when they were a young band in Madison, Wisconsin called 'Stinkfish'.  They went on to become the 'Siren Six!' & then 'Big City Rock'.  Although, in my humble opinion nothing will ever top the energy & fun they emitted on stage & musically as they did with Stinkfish & Siren Six!, I was really happy to have seen them finally get some attention & mild success as Big City Rock when they left the midwest & headed into the sunny hills of CA.  I enjoyed the first couple of EP's BCR put out, but the s/t album was a stretch for me.  They clearly wanted to write a pop album & stand aside bands like the Killers, Franz Ferdinand, etc. of the time.  I never saw them as that kind of group.  It felt to me these guys (from BCR & before) always had an edge to their sound even when they were reaching for the mainstream audience.  They could still write awesome hooks & deliver the pop without the pretension & maintain having an identity.  With the Remainers, I listened to the clips of all 6 tracks of the EP & have to say their is nothing on here that keeps my attention whatsoever.  A huge disappointment for me.  It definitely picks up where BCR left off in the consistency & style of the songwriting but on a downward slope.  So, if you really liked that BCR s/t album then by all means, but I was hoping they would have returned to an earlier style of material they did (like the original cut of 'Human').  The Remainers songs are well crafted, recorded, & produced.  Nate's vocals sound crisp & plush, Frank's keys are good as always & the drumming hammers out like it did in BCR.  That being said, this beat goes on to orchestrate an utterly forgettable list of assembly line pop songs with not much to be desired.  Even the song titles are flat & uninspired where they have to be overtly pronounced in every chorus, as if trying to be a #1 single at every opportune moment.  They have lost their artistic balance of the pop/indie sensibility they once had & just wanted to continue to set sale into that forgettable sea of mundane dance/pop & WB network serenades geared up to appropriately target kids in their teens & early 20's.  I'm really not trying to be harsh.  I'm just not sure how else to describe it accurately for what it is & what they seem to be going for.  I think they are better than this material here & need to find their center again.  I'll have to check in at a later time & see what they go on to try next, but I don't think I can take much more of this.  For those that really, really, really, really like modern pop then give this a shot, but if you were even slightly on the fence with that last BCR album as I was then don't waste your time.",0,0.0

In the music video it's like a ""CURSE"". It's like she see's this fortune teller, the fortune teller told her to take a ""SMALL"" bite out of the heart- shaped cookie. The cookie was so ""SWEET"", she made a mistake and took a ""BIGGER"" gulp. She say's ""true"" love would find you. LOL! Apparently, lol. It didn't turn out exactly the way she wanted it to be!!

I guess.. it magnetically drawn guys to her, became magically obsessed with her. lol. Everywhere she goes.. guy's keep stalking her, fighting over her. Fighting to where it's very dangerous, she needs to "" stay away"".

But the daring, Bold Lopez.. is a little mischevious, looking into trouble. Or trying to be ""curious"" of what's going on around her. People getting into car accidents, are WILD!! But, sometimes.. Curiousity ""kills"" the Cat. But.. the funny part is!! She acts like nothing ""happen"", is just dancing with a bunch of guys and Joking around.

I don't really consider that ""flirting"". It's more comical, and a cute Senario, joking around. Then her Papi comes, saves her. All the other guys are sulking, like "" screw this"". She forgets her purse, none of the guys take it. They don't want money!!

She runs off in her MINI Lopez car, is with her Papi. He's in the military. He looks like ED Tempelton. in the video. I was laughing. It was her twin.

But music videos aren't real. It's just for fun. Don't believe everything u hear! One time.. I was watching a music video, this guy had a bunch of hoochies all over him, it turned out he wasn't like that. He was actually not ""kissing"" them. They were all over him but yeah he wasn't a player. He was actually shy, modest. I remember.. jay- Z was flashing his Euro money in the camera. People were like ""yeah"" he's all cocky, greedy an flashing his money around.

It turned out Jay-z isn't cocky, greedy. I heard he's actually real, has a heart.

I suppose they say never judge people by it's cover, unless u really know them. Like the rumors of Jenny, her being a ho. They're not true! It's just gossip.

Don't believe in her music videos as well. Just because she's flirting in the video or whatever it maybe. It's the senario that's trying to match with the song.

Like "" I'm into you"". It's about a women who's into a guy. Not Jenny into that guy! People are so naive, dumb. They think because she's all over a guy in the video she's a ho. It's not true!

Unfortunately, she still has had a whole to deal with, especially with her music taking a tailspin downward. She still needs to find her own voice again. Her latest set of songs for the past several years have honestly not been the best in her voice. Her last album A.K.A. was so poor, it was not even close to even worth buying. That has also been the same with her last album Love?, which took several years, and a few poor starts.  I'm Into You, isn't exactly one of her better songs on the album. The song feels like I've heard it from Jennifer before, and it feels very weak from the heart alone. Her and Lil' Wayne have absolutely poor chemistry along the song. I really didn't find Jennifer gave it her best, honestly her weakest on this album. Hopefully, she needs to make better when her next album comes up.

3932,"I bought this recording to hear Strauss' Japanese Festival Music, Op. 84 (1940). The full title is Festmusik zur Feier des 2600jhrigen Bestehens des Kaiserreichs Japan fr groes Orchester (Japanische Festmusik), since it was the only available option.

The Japanese government commissioned music from composers of six nations to mark the 2,600th anniversary of the Japanese Empire. Other composers writing for the festivities included:

Hisato Ohzawa who wrote his Symphony no. 3, ""Symphony of the Founding of Japan""
Jacques Ibert who wrote an Ouverture de fte ""pour clbrer le 26e centenaire de la fondation de l'empire Nippon""
Ildebrando Pizzetti who wrote a Symphony ""In Celebrazione dell XXVIo Centenario della Fondazione dell'Impero Giapponese""
Sndor Veress who wrote his first symphony, ""Hungarian Greetings on the 2600th Anniversary of the Japanese Dynasty""
Benjamin Brittens Sinfonia da Requiem was also commissioned in this process, but was ultimately rejected by the Japanese foreign ministry as an insult (good for Britten!)

Japans request for a composition from an American composer was turned down due to the deterioration of relations between the countries.

Joseph Goebbels assigned the Japanese commission to Germany's most prominent composer, Richard Strauss. Strauss, age 75, put aside composition on his opera Die Liebe der Danae to work on Japanese Festival Music while staying in the Italian Tyrol. He completed the work on April 22, 1940 and received 10,000 Reichsmarks for his effort. If nothing else, the Nazis made life more enjoyable with easy money.

There are five sections:
Meerszene (Seascape)
Kirschbltenfest (Cherry Blossom Festival)
Vulkanausbruch (Volcanic Eruption)
Angriff der Samurai (Attack of the Samurai)
Loblied auf den Kaiser (Hymn of the Emperor)

Japanese Festival Music is written for a large orchestra 3 Flutes (piccolo), 2 oboes, English Horn, 4 clarinets, bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, contrabassoon, 8 French horns, 4 trumpets, 4 trombones, 2 Tubas, 14 tuned temple gongs, timpani, various percussion, two harps and strings. There is also an option for either an organ or an additional 3 trumpets, 4 trombones and 2 French horns. One of Strauss' works for chamber orchestra, in other words...

The premire was at the Kabukiza Theatre, Tokyo on December 14, 1940. Helmut Fellmer, a music professor in Tokyo at the time, conducted the NHK Symphony Orchestra augmented to 165 musicians for this occasion. The audience for this occasion also heard the other three commemorative works. Fellmer conducted this orchestra again on December 19, 1940 for a recording on Nippon Columbia.

Japanese Festival Music is probably Richard Strausss least programmed work and is often described as one of his weakest compositions. Norman Del Mar compared it to the Festliches Prludium (Festive Prelude for Orchestra and Organ) in which a vast orchestra piles one towering climax upon another. Strauss conducted the work for recording in late 1940 with the Bavarian State Opera Orchestra (possibly he recorded it before the Tokyo premiere); this recording was issued on CD in 1990 by Deutsche Grammophon in a 3-CD set of Strauss conducting his own works (catalogue number 429 925-2 GDO3), and four years later on Preiser 90205.

I didn't do my due diligence and run the Japanese webpage through Google Translate (though it has significant problems translating Japanese into intelligible English). It would seem that these CDs are a knock-off of the Columbia Nippon 1940 recording. I was amazed at how bad the sound was, regardless of when it was recorded. In 1940, the Germans were pioneers of hi-fi sound, though they may have kept this capability secret, given that Hitler used this recording technology to prerecord his speeches, so they could be transmitted from 3-4 different halls at the same time as he was giving his speech live somewhere. Being a murderous dictator, I presume that he wouldn't have liked to give out advance notice to the RAF about where he was going to appear ""live"" so they could drop a few bombs on him so he could appear dead (something close to that would happen to one of Goebbels' Reich-wide propaganda radio transmissions, which embarrassingly went off the air a few minutes after it started due to a British bombing raid on Berlin, probably prompting many angry Germans to shout ""MEYER!"" in frustration). I guess that's why they didn't share this Vergeltungswaffe with the Tojo regime.

At the very least, considering that this is one of only 2 recordings of the Japanese Festival Music - don't trust those ""Strauss' Complete Symphonic Works"" CD compilations out there people - I would have expected the Japanese to remaster the sound to a standard that it is possible to listen to. As it is, I wouldn't bother listening to this recording, though from what little I could hear, the music wasn't as bad as del Mar made it out to be. Even uninspired Strauss writing music for dictators didn't sink low enough as to produce complete musical drivel bad enough to get called ""Meyer"" by detractors. The NHK's playing is otherwise tolerable, though there are some major intonation bloopers audible through the snap, crackle and pop.",0,0.0

Then again, it could simply be that the lyrics don't make any sense.  I'm not one who balks at deep or complex song lyrics; at the age of six or seven I used to listen to Simon and Garfunkel and pick apart the meanings of songs such as ""El Condor Pasa.""  If the lyrics to ""Love Life"" go over my head, I believe it has much less to do with any lack of sensitivity and insight on my part than the fact that this sounds like the kind of nonsense I've found written in my journals after being overmedicated.

If I weren't committed to writing a honest and thoughtful review, I think I would have turned this off after the first thirty seconds.

4040,"COMMENTARY BY JOE DROUKAS

At this point talking about each song in detail I think would be a little tedious and redundant. It's just all about a simpler time when all you needed was one pair of Levis, a guitar, a place to play, and people to listen. Like the kid in ""Thyroid Eyes"" and ""Crazy Man Band,"" it's about loading up the van with equipment, riding forever, playing as hard as you can, having some fun, then moving down the road. It's about falling in love, growing up, making choices, chasing down a dream, and saying goodbye. The old ""Yankee Trader"" peddler gave way to Woolworths and Newburys, which in turn, as the song suggested, gave way to Wal-Mart and Kmart, which is effectively killing Main Street. This album brought me to New Hampshire, and happily it has been my home for many years now. And if you drive far enough into the country you still may find that old Yankee Trader selling goods and swapping lies. I've written many songs since this album, which have gone on to have lives of their own. But it all started here. And in truth, I guess Joe Drake and I never really said goodbye, since Joe Drake the rock and roller and Joe Droukas the singer songwriter are still at odds with each other, but continue to make progress.",1,1.0

4060,"This 2 LP set that ABC/Dunhill issued of one of their biggest artists, THE MAMAS AND THE PAPAS was released in early 1970. It contains most, but not all of their hit singles, plus album cuts. The difference between this and other compilations of the group's music is that this has interviews interspersed between some of the songs. Both John Philips and Cass Elliot were interviewed in 1969, and they give some personal and historic insight about the group in interview snippets. Another difference is that there are some tracks with studio chatter and rehearsal takes, with ONCE WAS A TIME I THOUGHT containing the longest rehearsal of the group practicing the song, and Michelle bursting out laughing because they sang it so fast. I CAN'T WAIT contains some parts of the group trying the song out, while DO YOU WANNA DANCE, DANCING BEAR, and DID YOU EVER WANT TO CRY contain some studio chatter at the beginning or end, or with DANCING BEAR, has John saying at the end that he never really finished the song. All of this is illuminating for the ultra Mamas and Papas fan. But if you may be bothered by hearing some conversation between or at the end of songs, another greatest hits album may be the one for you. This was issued to appeal to the collector, and the original pressing of it as a BOX SET with the booklet is the version to own. The box set version has a beautiful booklet filled with photos, and liner notes entitled "" The Last of the Magic Groups "" by the same writer , Andy Wickham , who did the notes to the group's first album. Lyrics to Mamas & Papas songs are included, but strangely, not every song here has the lyrics, and some not on the set are printed as well. Beware of other printings of this album that do not have the box or the booklet. Both ABC/Dunhill and MCA issued this album into the 70's and 80's in a regular double gatefold with only the lyrics, no booklet. Earlier copies on ABC/Dunhill as a double album gatefold may or may not contain the booklet, even though the cover still had printed "" includes many photos "". The later pressings by MCA just stated "" includes many lyrics "" on the cover. Also, this anthology features songs from just the first 3 Mamas and Papas albums. There is not even one song from the excellent 1968 break-up album "" THE PAPAS & THE MAMAS "" , so hits like TWELVE-THIRTY, DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME and SAFE IN MY GARDEN are missing from this set, making it incomplete for a thorough hits collection.

This album is the last and only time that ABC/Dunhill still had the original studio sessions of The Mamas & The Papas released on an album. Sometime in the early to mid 1970's, ABC Records threw out master tapes from their storage facilities. Unbelievable but that's the sad case. It may have had to do with the lawsuit that the group instituted in 1973 for unpaid royalties, as ABC would sell their catalog albums as direct cut-outs to the budget bins, and not pay their artist's royalties. How very sad that there are no original studio sessions available of any of the group's master tapes for decades now . That is why there aren't any unreleased songs, alternate mixes, different takes, or remixes done on Mamas and Papas reissues, except for 4 songs on the "" 16 OF THEIR GREATEST HITS "" CD issued by MCA in 1986. Somehow, 4 songs survived with either longer fades or a different mix. Some of the studio chatter/rehearsal takes of some of the "" A GATHERING OF FLOWERS "" versions have been issued on CD, such as on the "" CREEQUE ALLEY "" 2 CD set in 1992, and on the UK "" COMPLETE ANTHOLOGY "" 4 CD box set.

In addition to the collector's item appeal of the original box set with booklet, ABC/Dunhill also released a promo only 45 with similar album cover artwork that contains some additional interview snippets with John and Cass.

4069,"I think I found this album randomly one time I searched here on Amazon for this band. I had never heard of it, though myself and other Ace Enders fans had both of his previous albums. Still to this day I haven't met one person who knows about this album - and I feel this is a tragedy. Which is why I decided to review it.
This album is a little different than the first two. I would say the first two have somewhat of a pensive/experimental feel, but while this is still existent in Gold Rush it seems that instead of super long track titles and background noise Ace has turned to his ability to make simple, yet irresistibly charming music. Acoustic guitars, simple but exciting drum beats, tambourines (i think), shakers (like maracas. Not the religious sect that came from the Religious Society of Friends), and Ace Enders vocals make up 90% of the surface of every track. Someone could argue this album is more 'pop' than the previous, but I believe that would miss the point because it seems that Ace is actually going against the grain of experimentation that is all over in indie music now and just writes with his heart using the traditional mediums. The lyrics really connect with you in a way that pop never could.
but on past my rant: I'll review the tracks:

Gold Rush - opens up with percussion including the shaker and Ace's amazing vocals, and never looks back. Great track that deserves to be the title track. It will remind you of some of the tracks on The World We Know with it's pensive feel (and especially lyrics) and a chorus that you just can't resist singing along with. (8/10 rating)

Lame Duck - Beautiful mix of vocals, drums, and acoustic/electric guitar riffs (and later on the shakers) that no one else could pull off as well as Ace. This track doesn't have anything in it to make it stand out from the rest of the album which is why I rate it lower (though I love lyrics), but it still has the same charm. (7.5/10)

Connected - Amazing catchy guitar riffs really make this song, that while overall has a slower tempo than most of the album it still seems it would be the best candidate for a single. If I wanted anyone (regardless of their genre tastes) to be curious about this album I would show them this one. Check it out (10/10)

Complications - While this track seems overshadowed by ""Connected"" because it is relatively similar (tempo, instrument makeup) but doesn't have as catchy of guitar riffs, but the more I've listened to it, it has come to speak for itself. Make sure you wait until the last 30 seconds for everyone to come in with their parts - you'll be glad you did. (8/10)

Had To Be There - Don't discount this one because the intro sounds almost identical to ""Complications"" (same drum beat and similar acoustic riffs), however this track is a gem. It has one of the best choruses and bridges on the album. While I'm never sure what the lyrics are talking about sometimes, I love singing with them (whether the lead or background vocals). (9/10)

Don't Leave Me - though this track might not seem as good to someone not used to Ace's unique voice (though he does temper it with some subtle distortion or something), the percussion in this song and the catchy singing of the track title should win you over. Also this track seems the most mature for some reason. Perhaps because each section (verse, chorus, bridge, outro) seem different from each other yet stand on their own as good.(9.5/10)

Misery -  after listening to this album this has become my new favorite. Probably the simplest song on the album, with the verse having only guitars and drums, and the chorus repeats exactly and doesn't seem cluttered at all. Though it is really simple and might not be anyone else's favorite, I just absolutely love the lyrics because of the way he defines Love. Normally i'd probably give it an 8/10, but because I love the lyrics it gets: (10/10)

Gods - This is the one track where the electric guitars really rule over the acoustic. Interesting harmonies that do work but don't sound 'beautiful', rather seem more like just rock music. At first this song was too repetitive for me (and therefore exemplified the only shortcomings of the album) and so I really didn't care for it. Interestingly enough I actually came to really like it myself, which is why it gets an: (8/10)

Train Stop - This song is refreshing if you've listened to the whole album chronologically because its verse drumbeat is different from all the other tracks. There's a great mix of Ace singing quietly and also giving it his all. Electric guitar riffs go throughout the background and make it never boring to listen to. While it finishes the album off well, it seems almost to leave you wanting more on purpose. (8.5/10)

In conclusion this album is what it is and won't make excuses for it's possibly repetitive music and themes. Overall, this album has simple music put to some of the best lyrical writing out there, and deserves a chance from every Ace Enders fan. When compared to the previous I Can Make a Mess... albums, this one earns it's spot as equal to them.

4104,"I have been a big fan of Robin Meloy Goldsby's music since Robin Spielberg introduced me to it at least fifteen years ago with an unreleased cassette tape. I have also been a big fan of her writing since she asked me to write a ""blurb"" for her first book, ""Piano Girl,"" several years ago. Five CDs and three books later, I'm a bigger fan than ever! Goldsby recently released a new book and companion CD both titled ""Waltz of the Asparagus People."" The book is subtitled ""The Further Adventures of Piano Girl,"" and each chapter is an autobiographical story, most of which occurred after the tales in ""Piano Girl.""

The fourteen piano solos on the companion CD correspond to the stories in the book and richly illustrate them with sonic colors and textures.  They also make me wonder how Goldsby could ever feel that her playing isn't ""good enough"" for a concert stage. What I DO understand is the feeling of absolute panic at the thought of a full room of people sitting and listening intently rather than simply enjoying her music in the background over dinner and drinks. Goldsby's piano touch is graceful and elegant, but is also completely approachable and inviting. Eight of the tracks are originals, five are her arrangements of favorites, and one was composed by her daughter, Julia. Some of the cover tunes would be considered pop music in most pianists' hands, but Goldsby adds such a warm and personal interpretation to them that she elevates them to a higher dimension and makes them her own. Her original compositions are even more personal and come from deep within. All fourteen pieces are exceptional with no filler anywhere on the album. The covers include Yiruma's popular ""A River Flows in You,"" The ""Feather"" theme from ""Forrest Gump,"" the theme from ""Romeo and Juliet,"" ""Comptine D'un Autre &Eacute;t&eacute;, L'apr&egrave;s-Midi"" by Yann Tiersen, and ""Air on a G String: The Glass Piano"" based on JS Bach. I love all of Goldsby's originals, but especially like ""Mother's Hands,"" ""Till I Lost You,"" and ""Little Big Soul.""

Including its whimsical title, ""Waltz of the Asparagus People"" is exceptional in every way and is sure to be on my list of Favorites for 2011. I give it my highest recommendation.",1,1.0
4105,"Yes...I admit it!  I'm a HUGE Debby Boone fan (and Marie Osmond fan too...but...DON'T JUDGE ME! LOL!)

Debby's first two albums, the rushed debut (to build-on the hit ""You Light Up My Life"") and the better 2nd album, ""Midstream"" showcased just how good Debby's vocal chops were.  However, it wasn't until her perfect 3rd album (""Debby Boone"") that made this guy stand up and shout ""I LOVE THIS WOMAN""

The album starts with 2 fantastic songs, ""Girl Don't Come"" and ""Jamie""...uptempo songs for Debby and she just nails them both.  Track 3, ""The Worst That Could Happen"" makes me forget that it's remake and fits perfectly after ""Jamie"" but before ""With All Of My Love"". Ending Side 1 is ""I'll Never Say Goodbye"", a ballad that entices you to flip the album over for more.

Side 2 begins with Debby's version of ""Choosey Beggar"", one of my alltime favorite songs by this woman.  The Country-ish ""Breakin' In A Brand New Broken Heart"" follows and it's just awesome.. Next, comes the only hic-cup on the album, the disco-ish ""Meet Me On The Dance Floor"".  Not my favorite and a bit out of place on a collection of near perfect songs. ""You Took My Heart"", a nice ballad follows all leading up the THE ULTIMATE CLOSING TRACK ""I'd Rather Be Alone"".  A PERFECT beautifl ballad sung like no one could sing. I LOVE IT!

4116,"Let's Learn Italian Intermediate Volume 3 does an excellent job in providing examples of two important verb tenses: the Formal Imperative and the Future.  As with the first two CD's in the Intermediate series, Chantal makes the learning process both informative and enjoyable.

The first part of the CD covers the Formal Imperative, which is the form you're most likely to need unless you're visiting friends or relatives.  Commands are kept simple but useful: ""Vada in quella direzione."" (Go in that direction.)  One example shows that even a simple phrase like ""Mi dica"" (Tell me) can change meaning depending on the context: ""Si, mi dica?"" (Yes, what can I do for you?)

Most of ths CD is devoted to the Future tense, equivalent to ""will do"" in English,
using widely-used verbs in common situations.  Some examples show how direct and
indirect object pronouns are combined with these verbs in sentences: ""Glielo diro
appena lo vedro."" (I will tell him it as soon as I see him.)  Other examples
demonstrate the Future in idiomatic phrases: ""Se le cose non andranno meglio, ci
daremo al bere."" (If things don't improve, we're gonna take to drinking.)

For those who are familiar with LLI Intermediate Volumes 1 & 2, this CD will feel
very familiar, continuing in Chantal's molto simpatico style.  I highly recommend it.",1,0.0

4129,"Being a fan of Alec Empire's other recent releases, Futurist and The Golden Foretaste of Heaven, I was really looking forward to this one, so much that I bought the mp3s without even previewing any of the tracks and without reading any reviews.  I should note that I'm also a fan of his earlier album The Destroyer.

This album starts off great.  The first track, Control Drug, is exactly the style that I was hoping for - nasty synth sounds with drum & bass / jungle style drums and distorted vocals.  But things quickly go downhill from there.  The next track, Shivers, is plain boring.  It's one of those slow and simple songs that Alec Empire simply shouldn't be doing because it's not what he's best at.  Stick to what works.  Although I certainly dislike the cheesy, dated, 4/4 ""house"" style of the third track, Baby Skulls, the rolling bassline, the cool synth sounds, and the way the song builds, all make up for it.  It makes me nod my head and crank up the volume, so what more can you ask for?  Track four, If You Live Or Die (Live 2008), was surprising to hear for the first time because I like that song (it's from The Golden Foretaste...) but there's really no reason to hear the live version more than once.  It's not much different than the non-live version.  I would have preferred to hear new material such as the next superb track, Vampire State.  It's kind of dubstep sounding but more unique than most of the dubstep that I've heard.  1000 Eyes (Film Version) combines the dullness (slow and boring) of Shivers with the pointlessness (another old song?  really?) of If You Live Or Die (Live 2008).  The album ends with t.o.t. which has some kind of dated blip sample in it that reminds me of old Aphex Twin material, over another one of those house beats.  It's a very uninteresting way to end this album and it left a bad taste in my mouth.

If you are also a fan of the same Alec Empire albums and styles that I am, I recommend taking advantage of this ""mp3 download only"" album and only downloading the tracks Control Drug, Baby Skulls, and Vampire State, which I'd give 4 stars average.  But the album as a whole - 3 good tracks, 2 tracks that put you to sleep, and two versions of old songs - is somewhat disappointing.",0,1.0

4148,"This disc is really nothing more than midi music recorded on multiple channels. If you want to know what it sounds like, listen to a Casio keyboard playing public domain classical music. Rubbish of this kind of  is available many places for free. All they did was add the extra channels, but this adds no nothing whatsover to the experience of listening to this and is of very poor quality. Again, it just sounds like an electronic keyboard playing on your sound system (awful). There is nothing artistic or creative here whatsoever. That is the reason that you do not see any samples here.

Here is the kicker and what really throws up the red flags though: It seems that all of the positive reviews here are fake, designed to convince you that this is a actually a good product worthy of buying and listening to. I have investigated the histories of all of the 5 star reviewers and commenters for this series, and you can do the same. This is a known guerilla marketing tactic perpetrated, I believe, by one person. You can see this for yourself by simply clicking on all of the reviewer's (and commenter's) names and looking at their other reviews, comments and lists. You will find that they are ALL for this series only, with a very few for others, BUT even those few are cross-linked right back to promote these. In comparing them you will see the exact SAME type of language usage, idiosyncracies and mispellings throughout and across all of these, under all of the different aliases. This very same person also seems to lurk here and almost immediately responds to any honest reviews by attacking the reviewer and often posting a new fake review under a different fake alias in an attempt to bury the honest review, again with the very same language characteristics and consistent mispellings. It's likely that the same will happen to this review as well.  It has already happened to my review of another disc in this series (Bach). You can even find other message boards on other sites with the same exact types of comments, language, etc. If you are doubtful of what I am saying, order it anyway and see for yourself. I'd bet you'll find yourself returning it while shaking your head in disbelief after first listen.

I hope that Amazon will take some action against these dishonest and sleazy marketing tactics. Amazon reviewers have steered me clear of other bad products and consumer rip-offs while greatly aiding my many purchase decisions, and I feel happy to be able to give back to the community here.",0,1.0

Personally, I hate musicals that use cheap keyboards to replace or fill in for musical instruments. Most of the songs in this recording have that cheesy string setting, the kind you'd get on a cheaper brand keyboard or what would be used in karaoke clubs. Maybe this was budget or maybe they wanted it to sound cheesy. In any case the sound of the band or orchestra in this recording is really bad. The singing is ok, not broadway great. The price to download or buy is a little high for the so -so quality that you are getting. In terms of the story, you don't get much listening to the recording. Listening to the CD I picked up it was a  love story between siblings and going to prom. That's all I gathered from the recording. I have not seen the movie. But.. I'd guess the movie is not any better then the CD. If you are going to write a musical about a subject like incest or anything taboo, put some money and time into the CD.

Now having some of the songs I heard live is like reliving a moment of deep feeling, good vibes, and realizing that who he is, he can be nothing but honest.  Love him!  And his saxophone playing speaks volumes as well, as though Clarence is doing a duet with him.  As Jake has said in speaking of his uncle, ""It takes two.""  The entire band exudes wonderful energy as well.  It is clear Jake is careful who plays with him and finds the best.

The song sounded like it was pretty good but again the quality of the video wasn't so I couldn't really tell.

I ended up on a myspace page where they were announcing a new record release along with a change in name, to By Land or Sea. I immediately fell in love with the songs and got to listen to that song that I wanted to hear from the youtube video - Hell Broke Loose. That song is so good.

Great songwriting and really catchy songs, I really hope that they become more well known (but not sellouts) because they really have it.

4292,"Originally issued by Buddah in 1969, and reissued in expanded form by the UK Cherry Red label in 2010, this historic collection of bubblegum music is now available for domestic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/digital-download/dp/B004Z0PBLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">digital download</a>&nbsp;through Sony's Legacy imprint. The fourteen tracks of the original LP were pulled together from the biggest hits of Buddah's Kasenetz-Katz production team, including the 1910 Fruitgum Company's ""Simon Says,"" the Ohio Express' ""Yummy Yummy Yummy"" and the Lemon Pipers' ""Green Tambourine."" Brilliant melodic hooks, crisp studio productions and child-like lyrics combined to produce songs that were instantly likeable (except, of course, to self-righteous rock fans who'd long-ago lost track of music's simplest pleasures) and more importantly, memorable. Though aimed at the pre-teen crowd, the songs' surface-level innocence often harbored erotic and psychedelic allusions that were sufficiently camouflaged to escape AM radio's gatekeepers.

Though Buddah didn't corner the bubblegum market (the song of the year for 1969, ""Sugar Sugar,"" was on Don Kirshner's Calendar label, for example), their output is easily the largest concentration of the genre's exemplars.

4294,"This recording quickly convinced me of two things. The first is that Teseo might well rank among Handels ten best operas, and I can imagine fans who might place it in the top five. The second is that this recording is a dreadful choice for full appreciation of this work. The music is brimming with enough beauty and drama to outweigh the plots minor flaws: some illogical decisions by the title character and his would-be nemesis Medea, and a literal Deus ex machina ending. This recording, however, taken from a live performance in Stuttgart, merely suggests what a good version might be. The distracting stage noises and an outburst of vulgar shrieking at the end of one duet might be bearable if the male roles originally sung by two castrati and a woman had not been entrusted to counter-tenors whose skills proved utterly inadequate to the music. During the last forty years we have left behind the appalling habit of the first German revivalists who transposed the castrato parts down for baritones. Unfortunately, the rise of the counter-tenor has often led to an alternative that is only a little better. There are only a handful of counter-tenors world wide who can sing these roles well enough to prevent the informed listener from yearning for the parts to be handed off to a competent female singer. None of them were hired for this performance. So, in between some solid-to-superb singing by the women in this cast, we are forced to endure florid arias that painfully reveal the deficiencies of the counter-tenors technique, and tender, lyrical arias by the same singers that range from adequate to woeful. Those allergic to the goat-bleat of the overstrained counter-tenor should stay away. Its possible that these singers may have something to offer in the studio, where they would be untroubled by the need to be heard in balconies, could enjoy a schedule that sidesteps the mounting fatigue of a live performance, and would have the opportunity for endless retakes. Id imagine that they are embarrassed enough that this performance was preserved in recording, so I won't pile on by naming them and detailing which aria found each of them at his worst. These performances merely convinced me that to enjoy Teseo to the full I probably need to secure the highly-regarded version of Mark Minkowski.
One technical note: if you decide to buy downloads of individual aria trackswhich is a plausible decision, given the bad bits youll want to avoidyou should know that two of them in Act Five are mislabeled. The track listing for the aria ""Si tamo, o caro"" follows an error of the libretto and attributes the number to Teseo (Franco Fagioli); it is actually sung by Agilea (here Jutta Bhnert) as Handel intended. And Teseos aria ""Tengo in pugno ldol mio"" is attributed to Egeo, although if you make the first click to purchase the aria you will then see the correct attribution.",0,0.0

The album is full of engaging colors with both Indian and Western instrumentation and harmonies-- in particular, listen to Raaz ko Raaz (one of my favorites), Madhosh (another favorite), or Kyon Maane to hear how it works together.  (Please check out the samples;  my words here can't describe the overall sound to my satisfaction.)

I appreciate that the execution of the music on this album is very strong, and even from listening to the samples, you will be able to tell that this album was put together with a lot of care.  ""Hats-off"" to Nandini, the band, and the production staff.

4406,"Forced emotions are something that scores shouldn't do. Over my lifetime of listening I can tell when a score is trying its hardest to evoke a certain emotion. However, the listener should never be identifying the emotions a score is evoking; they should be feeling the emotions. Such is the case with the score to Atlas Shrugged. The emotions here are surface level, and while the arrangements are wonderful it can't seem to penetrate anymore than surface value.

Right from the first track that propels you into motion you get the sense of forced emotion. We then segway into the ""John Galt Theme"", which is covered in schmaltzy heartwarming sensibility. Now, the score does manage to go into some wonderful orchestrations that carry some emotional weight. However, once we get into the adventurous tracks the melodies somehow get bogged down by their complexity. They aren't overly complex melodies, but nothing ever builds towards anything grand. The synthetic sound of the whole soundscape doesn't help things either. Clearly this score was meant to be played by a huge orchestra and clearly synths are being used as a replacement. Now I can't speak for what the budget was, and it is very possible that was a limitation. But the score as a whole has a ""mockup"" quality to it.

By the time I reached the end I didn't feel like a progressed anywhere. The music didn't take me anywhere and in the end that's what a score should do. It should push the story, build with the cutting and not try to force it. While Atlas Shrugged isn't a bad score, it also isn't a good one. I don't want to identity emotions.

I suppose you could dance to this but it is a bit sluggish / lacks energy / is impotent.  The first portion of the song is virtually a cappella where her voice is accompanied only by a drum beat and then later accompanied by a lacklusterly produced background.  Her voice does not sound auto-tuned.  I think she actually has some raw talent and it is displayed here with some middle eastern influenced vocal gymnastics. So, Beiber fans take heart. As a one star review from a relative codger like me may reflect poorly upon a song that (as I struggled to get through a listen or two) may be just right for your longing of a boy who wouldn't be able to start a chain saw.

Dren (whose birth name was Breanne Durenberger, without the gratuitously exotic umlaut) is 23 years old, but you'd never guess from the sound of her voice - or the content of her lyrics (""I read that message that you sent me/Baby, like all the time"").  This is teenybopper pop, and not especially good teenybopper pop either.  The singing is adequate at best (I'm still trying to figure out whether it was actually Auto-Tuned, or just SHOULD have been), and layered over a backdrop of synthetic sound, it's catchy, in the way that advertising jingles are catchy: faintly entertaining in a trivial way and simultaneously just a bit annoying even BEFORE you find you still have it stuck in your head five hours later.

""No One Else"" reminds me of nothing so much as Rebecca Black's ""Friday"" - but at her age, Dren should know better.  And unlike ""Friday,"" this song isn't quite bad enough to collapse in on itself by one of those weird laws of quantum physics and become sort of painfully awesome in its sublime awfulness.  It's just an amateurish pop song.  If your idea of good music involves synthesizer-dependence, pitchy vocals, and insipid lyrics, ""No One Else"" should be right up your alley.  If you're over the age of fifteen, don't even bother.",0,0.0

4419,"I feel bad giving this track by Friendly Fires only two stars.  I didn't dislike ""Blue Cassette"" exactly, but I just couldn't honestly give it that third star.  The lyrics, which speak of the poignancy of memory, are mediocre.  The musical setting is more noisy than melodic, and at the beginning and end there are some weird, annoying sounds reminiscent of music played backwards.

4420,"Like the old saying ""you're beautiful when you're angry,"" Carmen Rodgers sounds really good when she's bitter. And she effectively captures the stages of hurt, anger and resignation of a love gone bad on her new EP, The Bitter Suite.

It's been six years since the Dallas-based singer won a sizable number of fans with her debut album, Free, and those fans have been not-so-patiently waiting for more.  Rodgers' full sophomore disc, Intermission, a complete story of a relationship gone good, then bad, then good again, will be coming later; but she is now issuing a big chunk of it (the ""gone bad"" part) with the digital release of The Bitter Suite.

Rodgers lets the listener (and her man) know from the get go where things stand, opening with a defiant tone on the neo-soul midtempo, ""Tell Your Story"": ""Tell your story at the door / 'cause I've heard it all before / and now I'm not so sure if I want this love anymore.""  By the time of the terrific next song, the acoustic gem ""Home,"" Carmen is more reflective but just as resolved to end the relationship: ""You say you want to come home / but home is where the heart lived / and I just want to move on / so should you.""

Male listeners be a bit unnerved by the interspersed table talk of a group of women throughout the disc, who verbally lump men into a pretty bad lot of liars and cheaters.  And Rodgers feeds on that talk, vowing not to get hurt anymore on the nervous, jazzy ""Never Again,"" another EP highlight. But as the disc approaches its coda, she begins to come around, realizing that there may be some value in all that damn pain, and she finishes in a more pensive mood on the ballad, ""Better U Than Me.""

The Bitter Suite has the benefit of holding together quite well as a thematic piece and having songs (particularly ""Home,"" ""Tell Your Story"" and ""Never Again"") that can stand on their own as singles.  But, like opening a book in the middle, one can't help but want to hear the whole story that surrounds The Bitter Suite, one that will be told on the full album, Intermission.  For now Rodgers fans can celebrate the welcome, enjoyable return of the Texas musical chanteuse.  But they'll want more...soon.",1,1.0

4428,"In the two (as of today) 5-star reviews of Liturgy's ""Aesthetica"" on Amazon, both reviewers mention how Liturgy is ""breaking all the rules"" or ""going against the trends"".  That is true...to an extent.  They don't wear corpse-paint, the album cover is white and, well, that might actually be it. (And can't we say that about a LOT of BM bands?)

You see, the PROBLEM is...they aren't going against any trends, they are part of a trend --  the trend of young American's getting into Black Metal (which, in itself isn't a problem, the conflict starts when their leader starts acting like the Scholar of Black Metal).

The BIGGER PROBLEM is...their music contributes nothing worthwhile or exceptional to the black metal scene. I could forgive the attitude of the band (pretentiousness) if they actually provided notable output, but this is lukewarm black metal. The primary influences of Burzum and Darkthrone are there, a little mid-period Satyricon. Nothing new.

THE BIGGEST PROBLEM is...while these youngsters are getting attention for this mild offering, other great new black metal bands are not -- Negative Plane, Nightbringer, Oranssi Pazuzu, and Blood Cult, to name just a few.  Also, some of the forefathers who Liturgy mooch off of have expanded so far beyond their core that it makes this album sound like a regressive work.  Arcturus, Ulver, Abigor -- they taught us that the rebellion of Black Metal could not be contained to what it was, and what Liturgy is.

Coming back around, the problem here isn't that these guys are posers, it is that they are just another bland, cut-rate black metal band among thousands.  If the album cover sported a grainy black and white photograph and a pentagram, it would of flown under the radar and ended up in a used bin somewhere.  Liturgy is thriving on what they say, not on what they do. Classic American youngsters, all talk, no walk.",0,0.0

4431,"This album goes nowhere and that's a shame.  There are some really good ideas in here that get squandered quickly or leave you hanging in every song.  I couldn't even detect where the choruses were on most of the songs.  I had to read the lyrics to find out.  It kind of sounds like they are trying too hard.  Song structures are all over the place.  I like being different but to be different just to be different just doesn't work.  Have an idea of what you are doing at least.  At times it sounds like a bunch of different riffs glued together to make a song.  I really wanted to like this when I found out that Kelly Sundown was in another band.  His talents are wasted here.  He is great as usual but the music leaves you wanting more and it just never comes.  I will not abandon them for this album because there are some good sections but most of the good has a lot to do with Kelly's talent as a vocalist. On the sticker it said Rock Hard Magazine gave it 9 out of 10 and this is the future of metal. I don't know what Rock Hard Magazine is but....Yeah right. Please don't insult bands like Kamelot, Symphony X and Nevermore with that statement.  THEY are the future.  It also said for fans of Iced Earth, Nevermore and others.  Iced earth's music is mediocre at best so yeah they are right there with them.  But to say Nevermore?  You have got to be kidding me.  I'll ride this until I hear another album from them.

4514,"Ernest Reyer (1823-1909) is most famous for his operas, in particular the Wagner-inspired Sigurd, which has received a couple of recordings  the later opera Salammbo has been performed since Reyers death, too, but I am not aware of any complete recording. Well, Le Slam, a symphonie orientale in five tableaux for soloists, choir and orchestra, is an earlier work, having been completed in 1850, and there isn't much Wagner on display here. Instead, it is a splendid example of the orientalism popular in France (and elsewhere) at the time; those things wouldnt fly well these days, of course, but I bet there are more people than me who (secretly or not) enjoys the lush, magical atmospheres of many of these orientalist works. The clearest parallel in Reyers case is of course Felicien Davids contemporaneous Le Dsert, which it resembles in style and atmosphere, even though Reyer claimed not to have heard Davids work when he composed his own.

The symphony (or whatever you choose to call it) is in any case a very enjoyable affair, with pilgrims, djinns, sorcerers, shepherds and soldiers getting their turns, and much beautiful, magical scenery paintings. Overall, however, the work is surprisingly restrained  the music is tuneful, but generally gently rocking and slowly building atmosphere; even the orchestration is generally transparent and only rarely veering toward bombast or clutter. I suppose that the material is ultimately not deeply memorable (no Lakm, this), but it is certainly enjoyable and appealing as long as it lasts.

Le Slam comes coupled with expected and, in this context, completely uninteresting excerpts from Bizet (Pecheurs) and Richard Strauss (Salome). Being thoroughly familiar with both operas, I don't think I have ever bothered to even listen to the excerpts here, and I doubt many interested in this release would care either. Reyers work lasts for approximately 50 minutes and the disc is still worth its price, however. As for the performances, I suppose on could imagine somewhat more polished ones. The Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Guido Maria Guida plays well, and the soloists and chorus are generally good, but lacks that last ounce of polish and finesse to always fully transport the listener to the magical realm Reyer is trying to conjure up for us (this is pure escapist music, after all), but I suppose that is also to some extent Reyers own fault. The recorded sound is a bit recessed; it is also a live recording , so you get the occasional cough and shuffle. Still, an enjoyable release, well worth checking out.",1,0.0

4550,"Overview:
On ""Transatlantic"" Chris Potter switches gears from the small group bands he has been working with and crosses the Atlantic to lead a big band in Denmark.  Chris Potter composed all the songs on the album and conducts the performance by the 18 piece ""DR Big Band"".  Chris Potter also shows off his top of the line sax soloing skills on most of the tunes.  I'm not familiar with the musicians that make up the ""DR Big Band"", but I believe that they are from Denmark.  The music on the album is fairly straight-forward swinging post bop.  It does not get quite as wild as some of Potter's contemporary big band leaders (e.g. Hollenbeck, JD Argue).  However, the songs are quite interesting with many intertwining parts.  Potter, who in my opinion is one of top soloists today, has many blistering solos throughout.  This is one of Potter's best recordings to date.  The big band is the perfect backdrop for his fiery solos.

Song Highlights:
The Steppes - My guess is this tune is inspired by the Central Asia Steppes region.  It has a worldly tinge and reminds me of some classical pieces written by Russian composers about this part of the world.  There is a nice solo by guitarist ""Per Gade"" on this tune.

Rumination - This tune opens with a reflective Monkish statement by Potter and pianist Magnus Hjort.  It quickly segues into an upbeat, funky interlude where the drums and bass remind me a bit of something you might hear in a Super Marios game soundtrack.  Over the top of that backdrop are some nice sweeping horn lines.  About half way through the drums speed up and get frantic and so does Potter's solo.

Quick - This tunes opens up with a staccato brass and drums line.  After a few bars the reeds come in with an intertwining line.  After a few more bars the piano, bass and guitar nicely blend in.  This is a terrific opening to the tune and the album.",1,0.0

Note:  I managed to glean Victor 78 record numbers via Joel Whitburn's POP MEMORIES 1890-1954 book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pop-Memories-1890-1954-The-History-of-American-Popular-Music/dp/0898200830/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pop Memories 1890-1954: The History of American Popular Music</a>&nbsp;and an old edition of L.

Dock's 78 RPM price guide&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Premium-Record-Guide-1915-1965-78-s-45-s-and-LP-s/dp/0896890546/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Premium Record Guide: 1915-1965: 78's, 45's and LP's</a>.  I'm reasonably certain of the recording/record match, but it's on a best guesstime based on date of recording matching the record release a few weeks/months later.

All the tracks on this Lp are electrical recordings (post-March, 1925), excepting acoustic ""Wang Wang Blues"" from Whiteman's earliest sessions in late 1920.

Per the liner notes, the musicians in the sessions include Bix Beiderbecke, the Rhythm Boys (Bing Crosby), Frankie Trumbauer, Jimmy Dorsey, Red Nichols, Bunny Berigan, Eddy Lang, and Jack Teagarden.  Mildred Bailey does vocals on ""Rockin' Chair"" and ""Stop the Sun Stop the Moon.""

Lp has great liner notes, two full columns.  This Lp concentrates on Whiteman's later 1920s-early '30s jazzier material; ""Mississippi Mud"" is the most jazzy track on the album.  ""Wang Wang Blues"" ain't bad, from Whiteman's early period.

I bought the Lp to get an example of Whiteman's recordings for Victor, after picking up a copy of a Potato Head Columbia Lp, CL 2820, and being informed by my shellac friend that Whiteman's best known hits were on Victor, not the Columbia cuts.  CD reissues of material this old tends to be legal boots (European expired copyrights) often taken from well-used private collections several (shellac transfer) generations down from the A&R masters, while I'm reasonably certain these two RCA Victor Vintage albums&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paul-Whiteman-Volume-1-LP-Vintage-Series-1968/dp/B00124WUTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paul Whiteman Volume 1 LP Vintage Series 1968</a>&nbsp;are sourced from the original masters at Whiteman's original recording label when he was at the height of his commercial powers.  Sound is remarkably clear and sprightly.  I was surprised, while playing these tracks, that I found them more jazz musically satisfying than Glenn Miller's slow romantic recordings (eh, boring would be the word), even accounting for the relatively staid dance beat and rinky-dinky '20s - early '30s arrangements.

Whiteman's recording periods can be broken down as follows:

Victor 1920 to mid-1925 acoustic recordings.
Victor electrical recordings from mid-1925 (about 78s' series mid-19550 or so)
Columbia ""Potato Head"" releases from mid-1928 to mid-1931 (Bing Crosby and Bix Beiderbecke at their peak)
Victor 1931-36.

Record series for the 1931-36 period break down to the following approximate dates:
Victor 22998 - June, 1932
Victor 24089 - August, 1932
Victor 24365 - September, 1933
Victor 24455 - November, 1933

White Bird-a short, uninspired version of It's A Beautiful Day's greatest hit. It is only 4 minutes long and not that interesting. It is a pointless remake. It was only included so stupid fans like me would buy the album.

Hot Summer Day-another It's A Beautiful Day classic. This is a seven minute version, with a really interesting, spacy instrumental in the middle. It reminds of Pink Floyd's Echos. The singing isn't on par with the original version, but the music is more interesting.

Swept Away is a jazz fusion instrumental similar to what Jean Luc Ponty or Michael Urbaniak would do. It is very nice, but not up there with the best of Ponty.

Easy Woman is a lounge act song. It sounds like something Tom Jones would do or like the theme song to the Love Boat.

This Man is kind of disco a number.

Baby Be Wise is like a combination of Easy Woman and This Man.

Spirit of America sounds like something Kansas would do, with a little Bruce Springsteen and John Wayne thrown in.

This is really not an album worth getting, but if you do, you will get a nice, spacy Hot Summer Day.
Hal Wagnet, from the first It's A Beautiful Day album, plays bass on some of the tracks.
The back up singer is called Dominque DelaCroix. Her real name was Linda. She ended up marrying David LaFlamme, and became the second Linda LaFlamme. She is not to be confused with the first Linda LaFlamme. The first Linda was responsible for writing much of the great music on the first It's a Beautiful Day album. She also sang and played keyboards. She left the group, and David, after the first album.
After the Linda split from David, David was not as successful at writing songs. After the first album, all the best It's A Beautiful Day songs were written by Fred Webb, who replace Linda on keyboards. Patty Santos replaced Linda on vocals, and It's A Beautiful Day recorded four more albums. For some reason, Santos was not on the first album even though she was an original member of the group.  On the last album, Today, David had left the group. Fred Webb and Patty Santos both died later.

It's A Beautiful Day has constantly been fueding with their original manager over the rights to the group's name and music. For this reason, the It's A Beautiful Day albums were taken off the market and have become very rare.  But, you can now get them and also some wonderful live albums.

David and the second Linda stayed together and have been performing since the late seventies. Currently they are performing under the name David and Linda LaFlamme, IABD, formerly known as It's A Beautiful Day. Val Fuentes, the original drummer from It's A Beautiful Day is also in IABD.",0,0.0

It was a real pleasure to listen to the recording with one exception. ""Fix Me Jesus"" has a terrible echo and that must be the fault of the engineers who remastered this recording. Otherwise the sound of the voice is excellent. The piano is a bit distant but that's probably the fault of the original recording.

Personnel:  Victor Dominicis aka Viktor Venom (guitar, theremin, echoplex); Eudocia Rodzinak (guitar, piano, organ); Peter Klarnet (bass); David Varriale (drums).

One of the best tracks is the cover of ""A Shot in the Dark"" from the Blake Edwards film of the same name.  The Coffin Daggers would be a natural for soundtracks for films like ""Pulp Fiction.""  The songs sometimes start off with a simple riff you've heard before, then take off in a completely different direction.  By the time you're halfway into it, you don't know where it's all going to wind up.  There's a lot of talent here.

If you download MP3s, download legal MP3s.  Illegal downloads can kill a band like this.  The Coffin Daggers have some videos on YouTube--shoestring productions, but they're interesting.

4614,"I heard this song one day on Pandora and thought it kind of sounded like he was singing about God.  It was a love song, so I wasn't certain.  So, I traversed the interwebs and sure enough I found it was.  I thought this was actually really cool.  I'm not super religious, but I like how the song could have a double meaning and could trick people into thinking it's about one thing when it's really about something else.

This song then brought me to the entire Torches album and I thought it was just brilliant and now I can't get enough of the band and the rest is history.

4637,"In the summer of 2011, I took my first trip to Nashville, TN. As a huge country music fan, I had heard of the legendary Bluebird Cafe. Upon arriving early afternoon and settling my things into the hotel room, my traveling companion and I saw a couple of things downtown, had lunch, and then ventured out to the Bluebird Cafe.

There were 4 songwriters in the round. Among them was a beautiful young lady with a radiance about her that immediately captivated me before I heard her sing. The first song she sang was Ruby Red. Any song that references the classic film The Wizard of Oz is ok in my book. I was hooked instantly. This young artist was Jessica Rae.

Upon her second round, she unleashed a powerhouse song of sorrow, redemption, grace, and hope called 24 Hour Church in Memphis. My companion and I stood there jaws agape at this beautiful song. We were fortunate enough to hear several other songs from this artist and when it was over, we purchased both CDs that she had available.

This CD is raw, poignant, real, stirring, playful, and is still frequently played here. There isn't a single bad track on the album. From the first song (24 Hour Church) to the closing track, this album took this listener on a journey through both the simplicities and complications that life has to offer. Jessica Rae has a way of coining a lyric and then vocally delivering a song in a way that is reminiscent of  Rodney Crowell, Emmylou Harris, Rosanne Cash, and Buddy Miller.

Jessica Rae is no ingenue. She is a seasoned and superbly talented artist who could easily stand equal among more seasoned veterans. This CD should be a part of any collection belonging to fans of country music as well as fans of singer/songwriters. She also blends in hints of rock and roll, folk, and gospel and pulls off each track with soaring confidence and immeasurable vocal control.

I was fortunate to be part of her Kickstarter campaign for her new release, Freedom Avenue. I received my copy shortly before the first of the year and it instantly became one of my Best of 2013 selections for my own collection. While some of the magic from the self-titled CD seems to be missing, the lyrics are strong and the delivery is impeccable. I enjoy all the songs on Freedom Avenue and it's a good, solid CD. Jessica Rae hits all the marks. I will not be surprised when a national record exec realizes what a superb talent she has and makes her a nationally renowned artist. She clearly has the chops and her music deserves to be heard on a much larger scale.

Do yourself a favor, pick up this CD and Freedom Avenue when it becomes available. I guarantee you will have no regrets.",1,1.0

I get the idea of why they would do this, as there are so many beautiful things happening on this record.

4689,"I have been meditating and doing self guided meditation for years, and have listened to more than a few meditation/hypnosis recordings. Many of them are crap, but this one fills the whole toilet full of crap! I say that because Bruce Goldberg has made a career out of billing himself as a hypnotherapist and has become very famous after being promoted on shows like Coast to Coast AM. I have purchased several of his books and found some of the evidence for past lives intriguing, especially when combined with the evidence presented by other reincarnation researchers. He portrays himself as a very credible guy.

With that impression of him in my mind I decided that I would try one of his hypnosis audios. I went to his website first, and that should have been my first clue that this dude is a charlatan. His website was probably built in the late 90's or early 2000's. His proof videos are poor quality VHS recordings from 90's daytime TV shows of him ""regressing"" people. He's offering tapes and CD's. No digital downloads. Interestingly he provides the script for many of his self hypnosis tapes and I read a few of them. All of them start with a short induction about imagining a white light filling your body. Relaxing the tension in your feet, thighs, back, etc. (standard hypnotic induction) ""Play New Age Music for 2 minutes"" Then more script pronouncing that as he counts from 1 to 5 you will ascend to meet your Superconscious Self. So it's that easy, huh? I decided to give this guy a try, but I wasn't about to fork out $65 for a CD! I found an audio on Amazon for .99 cents.

I chose Overcome Procrastination, because I was honestly too embarrassed to pick one like, Make Contact with Aliens. I sat in my favorite mediation chair, put in my headphones and pressed Play. Immediately the crap began. There was no soft music introduction, no calm voice telling me to sit in a comfortable position, take a few deep breaths, some explanation as to the process of induction....just ""Sit back, relax, imagine a warm feeling moving into your toes and feet..take a deep breath etc. (and before I could even take a deep breath), imagine this warm feeling moving into your ankles etc. (and before I could take a deep breath)..same script about moving this feeling into your thighs, hands, back, etc. This process was rushed, and it was obvious he was just reading from the same script that was on his website. The audio quality is horrible. It sounds like he recorded it by placing a microphone next to the speaker on his TV that was playing a worn out VHS tape. Seriously.

I was so annoyed by the crappy induction by this so-called world renowned hypnotherapist that I wasn't even relaxed as the ""New Age Music"" started playing to get me into a deeper state. The ""music"" sounded like it was from the same VHS tape, only it was louder than the voice audio (so if I had been relaxed it would have jolted me out of it),and I think someone's kid was playing the xylophone with warbled piano music in the background. I'm assuming that this ""music"" was from the early 80's and what once constituted New Age Music (little hint Bruce: Update your stuff). Once that torture ended, there was obvious pasted audio of a different session of Bruce telling me to imagine myself going up in a hot air balloon. As he counted from 1 to 5 I would magically ascend to meet my Higher Self. Why didn't I think of that! Is it really that easy? And BAM! There I was, suddenly in contact with the entire Universe! Not eve close. By now I was pissed that I was wasting my time with this low quality, not relaxing, hypnosis session.

After more crappy music Bruce came on and quickly read a script about how I would now finish tasks, etc. I literally heard the pages turn as he was reading! No emotion, no empathy, just quickly reading from a script. All I was thinking was, ""What a great way to make money! Pronounce yourself a hypnotherapist, write a BS script, play some crappy music, tell me that I'm now in the 5th dimension, I'm awesome, all my problems are solved, etc., then count from 1 to 5 and I'm back in my body with all that progress.""

I never write reviews, and because of this fake I've already wasted too much of my life listening to his recording and writing this review, but this guy should not make one more dime selling his cheap, rehashed, 1980's crap!

4695,"In 1976 Eric Burdon recorded an album of new material with a reformed original Animals line-up.  Legal issues saw the collection shelved for two years so Burdon decided to return to a solo career.  Recruiting an all-star cast of friends and associates including Alex Korner and Zoot Money (who co-wrote the bulk of the album with Burdon), he went into London's Advision Studios, recording 1978's ""Survivor"" with former Animal Chas Chandler handling production chores.  Surrounded by a crew of this caliber and talent, you would have hoped for something inspirational from Burdon.  Didn't happen.  Instead the album showcased Burdon clearly looking for direction - was he a pop star ?  An R&B act ?  A rocker ?  Burdon clearly didn't know which way to turn.  The end result was a mishmash of an album that ended up pleasing nobody.  That was unfortunate since the collection exhibit flashes of true talent; especially when Burdon seemed to relax and let go of the 'tough guy' image he seemed so attached to.  Check out his performances on 'Hook of Holland' and 'P.O. Box 500' ...  fun and way more entertaining than anything else on the album.

- 'Rocky' was a surprisingly decent slice of conventional rock with Burdon finding a key that was both comfortable and attractive.  Picture the kind of stuff bands like Slade and Status Quo were churning out in the mid-1970s and you'll have a feel for this likable number.  rating: *** stars  YouTube has a clip of Burdon lip-synching the song on the German television program PopRock (love the enthusiastic German audience):[...]
- In contrast, the atmospheric ballad 'Woman of the Ring' was a more typical performance in that it aptly reflected the damage done to Burdon's voice.  Quite a pretty track, the main problem with this one was Burdon's frog croak of a voice.  You were left to wonder if he was actually going to make it through the whole song.  Kicking in at the end of the song, Maggie Bell's shrieky voice didn't help the track.  rating: *** stars
- Another Burdon-Money composition, 'The Kid' was another likeable mid-tempo rocker that again featured a Burdon talk-sing performance. P.P. Arnold added her shrill backing vocals to the mix and hearing the pair of them trying to out-yell one another was actually kind of fun.  rating: ** stars
- 'The Tomb of the Unknown Singer' found Burdon trying to do country-blues number...  Pompous and overblown, this one was just plain painful to sit through.  I never thought I'd catch myself saying something like this, but I'd rather hear a Kris Kristofferson LP any day of the week.  rating: * star
- 'Famous Flames' could have been a decent blues-rocker, but producer Chandler seemingly felt obligated to bury Burdon under waves of shrill female backing singers and an overly busy arrangement.  Oh well, this one was at least listenable.  rating: ** stars
- Hollywood Woman' was a catchy enough song, but some horrible lyrics and another strangled vocal wiped out whatever momentum was generated.  Taken from the same German television appearance referenced above, YouTube had a performance clip of the song: [...]  rating: ** stars
- Judging by the lyrics including the classic couplet ""she has a calculator up her red dress ..."" I'm guessing Burdon's affection for Amsterdam didn't have anything to do with the city's museums.  Giving credit where due, this was easily the album's stand out tune.  Burdon actually sounded engaged and as if he were having fun spitting this one out.  rating: **** stars
- Yeah, Burdon's always enjoyed his reputation as a blues singer, but to my ears his barebones acoustic cover of 'I Was Born To Live the Blues' was simply dull and plodding.  rating: * stars
- After the last blues number, virtually anything would have sounded good. 'Highway Dealer'' certainly wasn't any great shakes, but luckily the song included a tasty, jazz-tinged lead guitar solo.  rating: ** stars
- At least to my ears Burdon's always sounded better when he simply relaxed and didn't try too hard.  That was definitively the case on the closer 'P.O. Box 500'.  A rollicking rocker, Burdon sounded like he was having fun on this one and the results were one of the album's best performances.  rating: **** stars

4699,"This Vaccines was a big album in the eyes of many a few years ago.  Let's listen to it.

""Wreckin' Bar"" is a nice anthemic punk song.  Well it sure sounds like it's in the punk spirit.  Whether it's technically punk or not I haven't a clue!  It's catchy enough.  ""If You Wanna"" has equally aggressive drumming and a pounding rhythm.  It's really catchy and enjoyable.  ""But if you wanna come back it's alright it's alright, it's alright if you wanna come back!""  That's actually  not the best part- the verse melody is the thing I mostly like about this tune.  ""Well I don't want to wake up in the morning but I've got to face the day, that's what all the friends I do not like as much as you say!""

""A Lack of Understanding"" has an excellent verse melody.  Really familiar too.  The chorus is pretty good ""I've got too much time on my hands, but you don't understand or you won't understand"".  ""Blow It Up"" is fairly forgettable since the vocals get wishy washy, but there's enough melody taking place to make it pretty good.  ""Wetsuit"" opens with hymn-like vocals.  The singer reminds me of the guy from Coldplay here.  The ""ah ah ah"" sounds like the 60's song by Dusty Springfield ""I Only Want to Be With You"".  Pretty decent melody either way.  ""You want to do things differently, you'll do them independently"".  I love the part ""Put a wetsuit on, come on come on, grow you hair out long come on, put a t-shirt on do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong!""

""Norgaard"" is fast-paced memorable anthem rock.  ""Her mind's made up she don't want to go steady she's only seventeen so she's probably not ready!"" is a funny line.  ""Post Break-Up Sex"" is another memorable rocker.  ""Leave it 'til the guilt consumes, I found you in the nearest room, all our friends were unaware, most had just passed out downstairs""  is a good lyric.  This song carries the same rhythm and melody the whole way through but it's a good one.  This band has a lot of talent because not just anyone can write a song like this and make it memorable.  Top notch songwriting puts this song in a higher category than most commercial-sounding bands who write music like this.  ""Post break up sex that helps you forget your ex, what did you expect from post break up sex?""  VERY clever lyrics!

""Under Your Thumb"" is pretty decent pop/rock.  ""I don't mind about taking it slow, I'm perfectly aware of what I'm yet to know, mutually assumed utterly consumed, totally adored, Eleanor!""  A quieter song but still pretty good.  Love the ""Eleanor"" part in particular.  ""All In White"" opens predictably with the chugging bass similar to so many alternative rock bands nowadays, but these guys... well they know how to make it better than most due to strong vocal melody talents.  The melody starts out quiet but picks up the second time around when the guitars comes in.  Really good song, and the lead singer proves he can sing honest melodies.  The way he carries out certain words contains a lot of feeling.

""Wolf Pack"" is perhaps the only song I'm not fond of.  It has a fast-moving pace but it feels like it's missing a strong enough melody to really grab me.  ""Family Friend"" is a relaxing tune with a much better melody.  Really good lyrics too. ""You wanna get young but you're just getting older, and you had a fun summer but it's suddenly colder, if you want a bit of love put your head on my shoulder it's cool""  Also love the line afterwards ""Half baked girl hey I'm hardly surprised, snake eyes disguise everybody's lies, faded nail marks on pale thighs and an awkward secret that someone denies, and now you're trying to get yourself back in, come on in"".

The hidden track, ""Somebody Else's Child"" is a short piano ballad of sorts.  I like how the piano gallops at times.  Touching moment of the album and drastically different from the faster punk/pop rock stuff.  This album deserves credit for the tight songwriting and strong lyrics.  It's a 5-star album alright.",1,1.0

4715,"""Blue Star"" by Seapony has a simple, pretty sound, but something about it just didn't sit entirely right with me.  Maybe I don't like the way the vocals seem to be buried under the music, especially the guitar.  I enjoyed the guitar bit, but I don't like it when the musical instruments in a song overpower the vocals like this.  It feels backwards, inside-out, unsettling, and makes it hard to follow the lyrics.  When I listen to a song, I prefer to know what it's about!  It's not a bad song, however, and I may well hang onto it.  Those who are less lyrically-oriented than I am in their enjoyment of music might actually enjoy it very much.",0,0.0
4716,"This song by Seapony has a slightly blurred female vocal accompanied by a surf-ish solo electric guitar against a fuzzy layer of J&MC-ish electric guitar and bass noise.

What is special is this arrangement, which starts with a pulsing 16 bar intro (8 bars of solo bass, followed by 8 more bars of bass and piano).  Suddenly, the original syrupy love duet becomes a driving jazz instrumental with a pizzicato bass line that keeps an eighth-note pulse running for the full 4:20.  Very danceable.",1,0.0

Could this huge difference be the result of live recordings ??  Perhaps those people still hear the sound of actual concert they had attended !!  Here are a few comparisons.  The Heifetz recordings certainly do not justify his performances due to the thin sound.  Otherwise they are wonderful.  The Oistrakh or Pamela Frank have their own personality & worth hearing  from time to time.  But the  performances (of all the 10 sonatas) which I would very highly recommend are by Arthur Grumiaux & Clara Haskil, recorded in 1956-1957  & recently re-issued on Brilliant Classics.

Unfortunately, I really began to feel she wasn't being making original music to call her own. For her latest song from Born This Way, Fashion Of His Love, she takes that feeling of trying to be like Whitney Houston, by sampling her classic #1 smash I Wanna Dance With Somebody. It didn't feel like it was driven from Lady Gaga, whom claimed Whitney Houston inspired her to make Born This Way at the Grammys earlier this year. Sadly, it felt like Gaga really lost her mojo. I think she should try and make more original songs, than copycats feeling like they've less taste than she does.

There are reasons why some compositions meant to remain in disparity. Playel's output is no exception.

4810,"The extensive NAXOS series on Sousa marches on with this current entry.  The interesting difference here is a new band.  No longer do we have Keith Brion leading the Royal Artillery Band of the UK.  Instead we have the Royal Norwegian Navy Band.  Why the change?  I suspect it has something to do with the new idiotic policies of the Ministry of Defense (The MoD) in London.  These bureaucrats, who seem intent on destroying what remains of British military music have instituted new rules restricting how their bands can record and perform on oversees tours.  The result is that we are likely to see fewer CDs in the immediate future of British military bands.

That said the Royal Norwegian Navy band certainly does a good enough job here.  The band while less known in the recording circuit performs well despite its slight numbers.  The recording quality of this series has improved steadily over the years.  Earlier on there was a thin, tinny sound to these recordings which has been corrected in recent editions.

The great thing about a series like this which mixes Sousa's marches along with his other music is that you get a complete band concert out of it.  There are enough marches on each CD to satisfy the march connesseur like myself, along with lesser known works by Sousa.  These numerous novelty items, Overtures and selections from his Opperettas show just how talented and varied Sousa was as a composer.  He could really do it all.  As such he stands as perhaps one of America's greatest composers in terms of quality and output.  Sadly much of this music is forgotten today as it was very much of its time.

There are a plethora of CDs out there playing the same 10 or 15 greatest march hits of Sousa over and over again.  The beauty of this series is that it promises to eventually cover all or most of his music, including the lesser known works and marches.  Each CD manages to have several well known marches on it.  Here we have ""From Maine to Oregon""  and the ever popular ""US Field Artillery March""  featuring the famous ""Caisson Song""  which has morphed its way into becoming the generic US Army song.  Funny how the US Army has no desire to have a march for each element, and prefers to just lump it all in with this single tune.  This is one of the things that makes the US Army a bland entity in my humble opinion.  Having a march for each part of the army, i.e.  Infantry, Armour, Artillery, etc.  might create a greater espirit-de-corps but I guess we forgot about that some where along the way.

Anyway, I digress here.  The overture ""Dwellers of the Western World""  is one of Sousa's larger works and deserves mention.  Modern day listeners might find the music for the Red Man and the Black Man to be a bit stereo-typed, but this was how they were seen in Sousa's time.  We should not pass judgement on it.

This is a great series that NAXOS has embarked on over the years and the new band, while perhaps lesser known than its predessor does a fine job under the capable baton of Keith Brion.",1,0.0

Simon's songs were unique and seemed to come out of a completely unknown place when they emerged in the 1970s. Horridly, after Simon died young from a brain tumor, his son took over the copyright, which meant that the entire orchestra could no longer play under the original name. They called themselves the Anteater's for a while - before the Internet there was no way to save the band. Then they grew old and most gave up music. The orginal CD's from forty years ago are a revelation. The phenomenal but understated dynamics of the original are altered and lost now that the son and his band have recorded weak, bland rewrites of Simon Jeffres compositions under the same song titles - selling commercially and to a supposedly brass-eared younger crowd. Some of us have the original CD's and LPs. Nothing like this bland, somnolent, idiocy. What a foolish turn of events. I urge you to quest after the original recordings and compositions.",0,0.0

4855,"I don't fully understand the market for old vinyl. I buy certain records because I want a particular performance that is not available on any other medium - I then transcribe it to digital and the disk goes back in the cupboard. I also believe that some people see the vinyl object itself as a collectable (like an old book or pocket watch)  because of its historical significance even though a better remastered version of the same performance may be available in some other form.

So why would anyone want to buy this? It is true that this recording has never been remastered or reissued so if you want to listen to what Schulze and the Telemann Society make of this work, then this is the only way you can. It is also true that in 1962 when this was issued, this may have been the first and - for some time - the only recording of the Dettingen in the catalogue.

However, to offset these two reasons for buying there is one overwhelming reason why you shouldn't. This is without doubt the worst performance of the work I have ever heard. Instruments are laughably out of tune, the chorus sounds like ther local bowling club trying it for the first time, none of the soloists are up to par with the alto sounding like a toothache-suffering sheep. Recording quality is not terrible but is poorly balanced with undue prominence given to the wind instruments.

This, of course could all be a good reason to buy the disk. It certainly is a memorable performance albeit for all the wrong reasons.",0,0.0

But, and this is a BIG but, the downloaded song is only 128kbps.  That's unforgivable!  When paying to download a song, you expect it be 320kbps, or at the very least 256kbps.  When money is involved, the consumer should be given the best quality format available.  But to give it to you at 128kbps is inexcusable.  This is exactly why piracy exists.

However, on most of his post-Band releases, there is a lack of energy that combined with his melancholy vocals just seem too dreary.  However, on this release from the soundboard at the Lone Star in Manhattan, Danko and his ""Band""-mate Richard Manuel combine with Paul Butterfield to produce a lively, joyous extended set that is a tribute to both former Band members who died far too soon.

It explains why she would make a bee-line for David Foster the second she was ready to make a ""come back."" If she were my friend, I would beg her to steer clear of the David Foster machine which seems to have the unfortunate tendency to flatten out every artist under a sickly-sweet blanket of strings and uninspired piano arrangements. Anything that guy touches has ""cheese"" written all over it: predictable, soft-rock friendly, and catering to the same people who run out to buy the latest Josh Grobin record.

She should reach out to real musicians who write their own music and understand their craft. I would love to see her make a pared-down record that is clean and from the heart, as opposed to something that sounds as if it was churned out of a music vending machine. I know she has worked with Allison Krauss - I wonder how she would have approached this song. The way it sounds right now is pretty awful, in my opinion - it sounds as though it was recorded in an hour.

It will be a real shame if Shania Twain throws her talent away and leaves her songs in the hands of producers who will ruin her music and engineer her songs to fit a predictable radio format.

On this new version you can look forward to:

1. Children singing in every song. EVERY. SINGLE. SONG. And not talented children. No.  These are children obviously plucked from some random mall talent show or failed Disney audition. Half of the little cherubs sound as if they're a special combination of underwater and congested while the other half are just completely tone deaf.

2. A creepy old man. But not just any creepy old man - this creepy old man sings a stunning version of ""What Did Delaware?"" that will become the voice that narrates your nightmares. Let your kid listen to it. I hear kids LOVE creepy

3. New verses to old favorites. You know, because a song that has been around forever probably needed a dumb new verse no one knows.

4. Every single other CD in the WeeSing series has been plagued by these same problems.

4964,"Rockpile was a rarity: a supergroup that didn't sound or act like one. It was the perfect 1980 band, combining love for and experience in the music of the past three decades ('50s, '60s, '70s) into its own perfect album and tours. Rockpile came into existence when one of the all-time great songwriters, Nick Lowe, joined a great guitarist with a notable history, Dave Edmunds, a great drummer, Terry Williams (soon-to-be of Dire Straits), and a fine guitarist in his own right, Billy Bremner. They got together to have fun, and they split up when the fun was over. Perfect.

'Live at Montreux 1980' is their perfect live album. Tight, hot, wham-bam-ohCharlieonemoretime!-thank-you-ma'am, unbelievably lively. Reports are they got dropped from a tour with stablemate Bad Company because the guys made Paul Rodgers & Co. irrelevant; they left the stage with the audience in their pocket. I'm listening to 'Montreux' as I write this review, and there's no doubt why.

Malcolm Dome wrote the liner notes to 'Montreux' with a similar sentiment to mine. A metalhead ('Kerrang!') liking rockabilly? Huh? Listen to this CD, and you'll hopefully see why.

The melody is slow and deliberate, just like the pacing of the game, and things pick up slightly later on when the piano does a bit of solo work on its own.

It may not be the most sophisticated song out there, but it's not supposed to be.  If you want something energetic or complicated, look elsewhere.

There is a bit of The The and Belle and Sebastian within the vocals and a synthesis of beat and rhythm of Owl City.  But regardless of one's musical interests, ""Clutching Stems"" is worthy of more than one listen.",1,1.0

5050,"Every Day is a family drama starring Liev Schreiber and Helen Hunt. The film revolves around a family in day to day life and pretty much explores life and everything that comes with it. For the score Jeanine Tesori composes a wonderful small score that has all the right beats but misses being a grand arcing piece. Now you may say that the film is about hitting small moments and such, but any film with a score release that is only 16 minutes clearly isn't letting the score do its job.

What we have here are simple little melodies that while good don't do much in terms of crafting emotional depth. The central motif is quite beautiful and provides a wonderful anchoring point. The score is mostly piano, guitar and strings so the melodies are very strong and hit precisely. What the score does well is craft a warm feeling and then pulls it away so you get a sense of longing. Unfortunately due to the short track times and overall short running time the music doesn't have much of an effect. I absolutely love the last track and it's a great finishing point but it wasn't until that last track that I became completely immersed with the emotions that the music was communicating.

The end result feels like a wonderful vision that wasn't allowed to spread its wings. When films don't let the score flow the way a score should the result is a choppy obstructed emotional arc. It's essentially cutting off the blood flow of the film.",0,1.0

Either this is a very old performance remastered (poorly) from tape, or a recent performance with depressingly poor sound engineering.  Or perhaps it was overcompressed at some point and then upsampled to 194 kbps before being made available, though that would make no sense at all.

5069,"I don't know why Breaking Benjamin allowed a perfectly good song to be ruined, but a part of me likes to think that this was done without their knowledge. The piercing cat-in-heat vocals of the female adds nothing to this track... instead, it makes it sound like an abomination, the result of overzealous music producers trying to cash in on the ""hard alt-rock with female lead singers"" genre that has lead to such plagues like Skillet and Evanescence. They are the Creeds and Nickelbacks of the rock genre, bland bands that sound alike with no real distinction other than how much mascara the males in the band wear.

Back to the song. The song was good when released. Made for a soundtrack, and served its purpose well. With the addition of a banshee yelling in the background off-key with no mixing other than volume levels, the song has the same quality one would expect from a child singing into a microphone to his/her favorite Dora the Explorer song (but at least, it may be considered ""cute"" in that case). In this case, someone spent money to fly the poor, talentless child to a recording studio, sit her down and say, ""hey, here's a song that was popular among a niche group for a few months, give it a go and see if we can't spice things up!"", and then pay to have it released nationwide. It makes as much sense as spending money to have Rebecca Black make songs.

Can one blame the female singer for doing this? Not really. As bad of a singer as she may be, if someone was offered money to sing something, they would take it, even knowing that they may sound like Oscar the Grouch on crystal meth and Red Bull. Perhaps, due to circumstances, one can blame Breaking Benjamin, assuming they hold all the rights to the song. However, blame can be applied to the ""composer"", ""mixer"", and distributor. Note that the first two are in quotation marks to emphasize sarcasm, as the distributor is the only one out of the three that knew how to do their job correctly, whilst the others had the ambition to their jobs right like Bonnie Grape had to lose weight (that is a reference to the book ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", for those of you who don't know, or rather, the movie, for those who were born in the generation that promotes music like the one this review is about).

Digressing back to the point of the review, if there is any slim chance that the Stop Online Piracy Act can somehow stop abortions like this from ever occurring ever again, then not only do I support it, I will bludgeon those who oppose it, feed them to iguanas, then take the fecal matter that is produced by those iguanas, load them into a rocket, and fire that rocket into the sun.",0,0.0

5072,"Originally posted on my blog, Hip Hop Is Read (Nov. 8, 2009):

The fate of the Shaolin Temple was sealed by its leaders' refusal to open its doors to newcomers seeking to join their following. Had it not been for the monks' initial anti-proselytization policy; had they accepted all those who sought entrance, the Temple may never have been destroyed. This important lesson, often recounted by The RZA, is a perfect analogy for the Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture series. Released in 2005, volume one introduced a lineup of indie/underground emcees whose form and style were so compatible with Wu-Tang that it made for one of the year's most thorough (and thoroughly enjoyable) albums. In 2009, a new chamber of cross-breeding music has been opened, this time introducing a whole new genre/style to the Wu-Tang sound: Enter the Dubstep.

Dubstep originated earlier within the decade in the midst of the UK garage scene. A fusion of house, drum and bass, 2-step, and London's grime, with influence from dub reggae, dubstep is characterized by its dark, uptempo beats. While artists like Lady Sovereign and Dizzee Rascal have expounded definitely-British sounds to the United States' audience, the movement hasn't really caught on across the pond... or has it? This year alone, dubstep has made a significant leap into the consciousness of U.S. music fans, whether they knew it or not. Dubstep producers Chase and Status' smash track ""Eastern Jam"" was adopted and remixed by none other than Snoop Dogg on his promotional single ""Snoop Dogg Millionaire"". Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture Volume 2: Enter the Dubstep seeks to further familiarize this new audience.

While volume one of the Indie Culture series brought along a roster of emcees, volume two is production-centric, highlighting the work of over a dozen dubstep producers. To the newfound dubstep listener - I'll admit, I'm one of them - Indie Culture Volume 2's mixes are either hit or miss; thankfully, they're mostly hit. Tracks like Chimpo's remix of the haunting ""Cinema"" by the GZA and his son are eerily intensified by the sinister keys and the dark and sparse soundscapes played throughout. In such instances, the production creates a brand new setting, providing the vocals an alternative meaning to the original; in others, they re-sample original beats, putting an emphasis on dub remixing rather than remaking. The Scuba Scythe remix to ""Street Corners"", for example, retools the great Jean Plum sample from the original, crafting a bubbling, new interpretation that's equally pleasing to the ears.

Unlike the first entry in the Indie Culture series, Enter the Dubstep does not feature any new vocals. The album is a hodgepodge of verses and choruses from previously-released Wu-Tang and Wu-Tang affiliate albums like Raekwon and Icewater's Polluted Water, Lord Jamar's The 5% Album, Wisemen's Wisemen Approaching, GZA's Pro Tools, U-God's Dopium and more (including volume one of the series). While it would have been nice to hear some new lyrics - especially by the main members of the Clan - it works out better this way since this collection is intended to primarily highlight the producers; as such, it's gainful to compare and contrast the originals to the remixes.

It's worth noting that being a fan of Wu-Tang is not an assurance that you'll enjoy this album. Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture Volume 2: Enter the Dubstep is very much like Linkin Park's Reanimation in this regard. Open-mindedness is a pre-requisite, particularly for the untrained ear of the genre being tackled. Nineteen tracks deep, unless you're a dubstep fan you may find yourself pressing the fast-forward button once every few or so tracks. But like Reanimation, the core content is still intact despite the altered sounds and backdrops. Overall you'll find that there's plenty of common ground to be shared and enjoyed when you Enter the Dubstep.",1,0.0

One thing to add though, the wand was just as loud as the hitachi at full speed, so we were a bit both disappointed about that. She used the wand about once a week since we bought it, and for about 10 minute sessions, sometimes less. After the 3rd use the wand start making a horrible burning smell. Some things really can ruin a mood when all you smell is burning metal and plastic. By the 4th and 5th use the fumes were just unbearable, and you could hear the motor inside speeding up and slowing down, speeding up and slowing down. It was like an old broken motor boat.

There doesn't seem to be a way to download a song after Amazon Music THINKS  you've already downloaded it. I had to go buy it again on iTunes so I could actually download it and I'm happy with my iTunes purchase. This is a great song that I really enjoy because it's such a happy and upbeat song. I just wish this purchase would have gone more smoothly.

5154,"I've said before that I don't understand the point in giving away a remix as the Free MP3 of the Day.  I don't know Amon Tobin's ""Surge"" in the first place, so why would I want to hear it remixed?  Such were my thoughts as I waited for this track to download.

Then I actually listened to it, and all rational thought ceased - and I came to a new understanding.  No, I didn't figure out why Amazon would choose to call special attention to a remix of a song most of us have never heard.  What I figured out was why this is called the ""Two Fingers Remix.""  I believe it's because this is what you would hear in your head if you stuck two fingers into an electrical socket.  Indeed, the sound of this piece can best be described as ""the experience of electrocution in slow motion,"" though ""cats mating in a video arcade, c. 1990"" comes close.

Dear readers, I have had days when I was feeling stressed out and not really in the mood to write a review.  I have had days when my sensitive soul was so battered by unfriendly feedback as to tempt me to retreat quietly into a corner to lick my wounds.  But never in all the time I have been reviewing the Free MP3 of the Day have I come this close to skipping a day altogether - because this song had barely started before I found myself painfully eager to turn it off, and I can't in good conscience write a review of a song I haven't listened to all the way through.  I sucked it up and toughed it out - several times in fact - just because I could never live with myself if I didn't warn you what you were getting into if you clicked that oh-so-innocuous ""Download"" button.

There is such an eclectic selection of worldly instrumentals.  Some songs have become daily favorites, especially for de-stressing, meditating, yoga, or falling asleep.

The high notes are tinny. The bass is distorted and fuzzy. There are cracks and pops as if the source material was damaged vinyl. The price for 85 Peterson tunes sounds too good to be true, and the result fits that cliche. If you don't believe me, just listen to the track samples. The problems are evident in virtually every one of them.

If you like jazz, by all means listen to Oscar Peterson, but please, please, don't let this be your first experience. Oscar Peterson and his Trio are top flight talent.

There are more titles available as cd singles on the HOT 100 than there has been in years. The difference now is that many are exclusives. Last year WalMart led the way with 17 exclusives & some of their stores even started promoting cd singles. Other stores like Justice, Target, Hot Topic & Borders & independent record stores have had exclusives & even some artist websites like Taylor Swift are selling them.

The Californian four-piece, Phlying Saucer, return to the fray with a second 5-track EP of super-melodic pop-punk. Bassist / vocalist / knob twiddler, Evan Brass, has certainly earned his bonus with a razor sharp production which effortlessly leaps out of the speakers, grabbing the listener by the collar, and demanding full, unwavering attention.

EPs work brilliantly for new bands without a full album of songs to release, but equally there's absolutely no room for filler, and it's to the band's credit they understand completely the stipulations of the format. All five songs deliver maximum hooks and thrills, and it's obvious from the moment opening track ""Breaking Down Takes Two"" hits its chorus, we're in the hands of a band making the most of their opportunity.

5320,"This is truly a great selection of songs. I know I'm treading on thin ice here, doubly so because of both the singer and the songs sung on this set of mp3 selections.

I only became aware of Al Jolson back in the late 1970's or early 1980's after seeing ""The Jolson Story"", and it wasn't really the star that impressed me so much as it was his voice and singing style along with the songs sung. People argue that he was one of those who sang in minstrel shows and in black-face which only served to further stereotype and denigrate African-Americans of the times, and to enjoy his music now only further serves to do the same. I can't speak to that. I wasn't there, but I know those were different times, and Jolson was playing to different audiences with different mindsets. My Parents listened to Foster's songs, which was how I grew to enjoy them, but hearing Jolson sing them was truly an enjoyable event. There was never a desire to see Jolson all dressed up in black-face, however. I don't admire the man that much!

As for this selection of mp3 downloads, I am not Jewish, so I can't speak to the few selections chosen that represent his religious upbringing, but, as I said, I have always enjoyed Stephen Collins Foster's songs, ever since I was a child in the late 1950's, when it was still politically correct to listen to them. And to combine the voice of Al Jolson with the tunes of Stephen Foster, even in these times when it may not be politically correct to listen or play such songs, I say is like a match made in heaven.

For those of you who like and admire this singer, these songs would make a great addition to your collection as they are much different that the usual show tunes you hear him sing, and only add to the bulk of his repertoire already existent.",1,1.0

There is a much more listenable version of the same recording available through another music service but it would have required downloading an unwanted storefront and player software just to purchase the track. Hopefully Amazon, in the future, will be able to offer a much better version of the recording than this one without purchasers having to jump through hoops to download it.",0,0.0
5322,"If you are an Ellington/Strayhorn fan this 1960 album will grab you with some excellent renditions of Take the A Train and Do Nothing Until You Hear from Me that clearly have the Mingus touch.

Mingus had an unabashed admiration for Ellington, which probably culminated as a high point when he and Max Roach collaborated with Ellington on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Money-Jungle/dp/B000SZDMES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Money Jungle</a>. Like that album, Max and Mingus are paired on this one. I must say that as much as I admire Max I prefer Dannie Richmond when paired with Mingus because the way Mingus and Richmond would stretch and compress time, almost telepathically, intrigues me. It also influences my own playing when I am with the right musicians. With Max none of that stuff happens.

The entire album is classic Mingus. Indeed, it was originally released as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pre-Bird/dp/B000VRITJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pre-Bird</a>, but in typical Mingus fashion it was repackaged. And, as if to underscore that, Mingus Fingus No. 2 on the original becomes Chazz Fingers No. 2 here.

Instead of my trying to dissect the tracks, just give them a listen from the sound samples on this page. If you are a Mingus fan, chances are you will like what you hear. If so, instead of immediately pulling the trigger, first check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/5-Classic-Albums/dp/B0071XS3US/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">5 Classic Albums</a>, which is a value-priced set of Mingus albums and where I obtained my copy of this one.",1,1.0

Jolie Holland's voice.

I don't have a problem with deep and husky voices, per se.  It was just last week that I gave a five-star review to Marianne Faithfull's ""Why Did We Have to Part,"" and I've adored Julia Fordham for years.  However, there's something about Holland's voice that just grates on me.  Maybe it's the way she slurs her words sometimes so that it's hard to make out exactly what she's singing (did she go right to the recording studio after a root canal or something?).  Maybe it's that her heavy, breathy huskiness reminds me of the voice of a longtime cigarette smoker.  Perhaps it's her whiny tone, or the way she seems to be trying to swallow and sing at the same time, or just a feeling I have that she cares more about her affected delivery - I mean, her ""unique style"" - than what she's singing.

Whatever it is, I don't like it.  It's not a terrible song, but I'd definitely recommend listening to the sample before you download.",0,0.0
5413,"Been following Jeff Wood since last year.  Live near San Antonio so my friends, family, and I are fortunate enough to see him live quite often.
This album is my second favorite by him (Come What May being my favorite).  A few of the songs that stand out are Little Outlaw (my girlfriends' favorite), Wyoming Skies, Heroes, and Cell Phone Junkies.  Borrowed Time is very good.
The beats in his music are sometimes slow tempo, sometimes fast.  He has a wide range which is one of the reasons everyone who hears his music ends up enjoying it.
If you are tired of the same old music being put out by mainstream and are looking for something with substance, heart, and overall great music, then try this album.  His music always brightens my day.

This CD contains several Bing Christmas recordings that have never been on CD before, the most exciting to me is the inclusion of Bing reciting ""Night Before Christmas""!!  Also included is the rare original 45 ""Christmas Star"" and another one not on CD before is ""Away In the Manger"" taken from one of Bing's annual Christmas Eve Around The World broadcasts, this song includes his little woman singing along with Der Bingle.  Night Before Christmas & Away In Manger were both released only on a 45 just a couple years ago, but I didn't want to buy it on 45, I wanted it on CD.

5437,"After three successful albums in the early 1980s and 7 R&B hit singles (one of them reaching #1, ""Lovelite""), O'Bryan finally releases his fourth and final effort by the end of 1986.  Even at his peak in 1984, O'Bryan still struggled a bit to reach the same success as many other R&B hit makers and now as of 1986, the competition was a lot tougher with Anita Baker, Janet Jackson, Loose Ends, and Freddie Jackson dominating the R&B charts that year.  Hip-Hop/rap music had already made a themselves a genre as nearly as equal to R&B and pop.  New Jack Swing music was slowly emerging by that point of which fused Hip-Hop and club oriented songs with R&B.

Since 1984's Be My Lover success, O'Bryan spent nearly 3 years coming up with a good follow up that would adapt to the change of pop/R&B music, but there was not much luck in those fields, however he managed to gain one last hit, ""Tenderoni"" (#35, R&B) that became a club hit in early 1987.  Unlike his previous albums, O'Bryan and Soul Train host, Don Cornelus didn't produce all of the songs.  O'Bryan recruited Jerry Knight (ex-Raydio member and ex-Ollie & Jerry fame) and Aaron Zigman to write and produce three of the 8 tracks that includes the slammin' ""Tenderoni"" and the sensitive and heartbreaking, ""You Have Got To Come To Me.""  The latter didn't chart, but in my opinion it sounds better than The Jets' 1986 hit, ""You Got It All"" (also produced by Knight and Zigman).  I think the 7 inch edited single version was better because the album version just repeats the chorus (too redudant), plus the sound quality wasn't that great.  The best song on the album has to be ""What Goes Around"" which was also produced by Knight and Zigman and is a tuff dance track that should have been his second single, but Capitol records blindly chose the silly ""Driving Force"" as a single instead.  The only O'Bryan/Cornelius produced song I enjoyed from this album would have to be ""Is This For Real"" of which is a sentimental and beautiful new jack ballad that was far longed overlooked.  Now that song is Surrender's best ballad.  Before someone sends their hate mail to me, I wasn't that fond of the ballad, ""Maria,"" but it wasn't his worst song.  The title track was a dissapointment (instrumental was a rip off of Luther Vandross' ""Give Me A Reason"") while ""Dreamin' Of You"" was musically and vocally ""way too busy and unappealing.""

""Tenderoni,"" ""What Goes Around,"" and ""Is This For Real"" were the only highlights of the lp with ""You Have Got To Come To Me"" rating 3.9 out of 5 (mid light). It was great that O'Bryan shared production duties with 2 top R&B producers, but I think many of the songs suffered from the repetitive chorus lines and instrumentals.  I think the album was sabatoged just like O'Bryan's career was shortly after the album's release.  It didn't help that there were many nasty rumors about O'Bryan circulating around the black music media that rode the passenger side with Capitol's bad deals for the 25 year old singer.  His dissappointment with the music industry prompted him to go on a early retirement from the business. Other than appearing on Karyn White's first album in 1988 (see linear notes) and Paul Jackson Jr's 1988 album, I Came To Play, as a featured vocalist, O'Bryan was non existent until 2007's mp3 (later cd) release, F1rst.  Out of all his albums that should be reissued and remastered to itunes, Surrender wouldn't have been much worth it.  I think Surrender would've done better with the wonder works of Reggie Calloway, LA Reid & Babyface, Nick Martinelli, and better yet Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis because O'Bryan definitely had the vocals and energy for their type of music.",0,0.0

5443,"This is a review of both Noah Aronson's album ""Left Side of the Page"" and ""Am I Awake"" - I listen to them all in one playlist.

Noah Aronson's music is great for helping out new converts to Reform Judaism, or the interfaith partner of a Reform Jew, or just really anyone who wants to know what a Reform Jewish religious service sounds like (so long as they use the prayerbook I mention below - which so far in my experience, most do).  All with some of the most beautiful voices out there, and really gifted musical arrangements.  I believe that Noah Aronson composed the melodies in this album (not positive on that though).

Several of the songs in Left Side of the Page and most of the songs in his other album, Am I Awake, follow along with one of the main Reform prayerbooks, Mishkan T'filah, which I personally find really beautiful in itself. When I was trying to find sources for Jewish service prayers and songs, almost all the prayers I could find were Orthodox or Consertative and didn't align to the services I was attending.  And many had (sorry to be judgmental, but this is music and it's hard not to notice!) really strident voices, too ""old opera-y"" voices, and/or awful accents in their Hebrew (eg ""Adonoy"" with an emphasis on the oy!).

This was a really nice change of pace - a guitar, a light male voice (tenor?), an easy switch back and forth between Hebrew and English, a light accent (more Israeli than Ashkenazi), pretty duets with pretty-voiced cantors and musicians (including one really cool Nickel Creek sounding guitar arrangement) and nice melodies.  A really nice, respectful, enjoyable listen - and a great way to learn your way through a service.

That said, if you're trying to learn how to chant prayers (some songs can be put to whatever music, while others have to be chanted according to the little squiggles in the Torah - sorry don't know the name of them), you should Google ""Temple Habonim V'ahavta"" and learn for free from Cantor Jodi Blankstein, who has an incredible voice.",1,1.0

This is the only mp3 source of takes 3 and 4 that I'm aware of. Each take is different enough that they are all interesting to me.

If It Ain't One Thing, It's Another (3:17); B3. Feelin' That Rhythm To The Bone (2:41); B4. Make Us Once Again (r:17); B5. Jump For Joy (2:44).

When it started its climb to a modest # 140 on Billboard's album charts, the single Dancin' Man was rushed out as Epic/Sweet City 50335), eventually reaching # 23 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in late March/early April 1977 b/w Love Pollution (not part of the album). A later single from that album,  Sweet Summertime, topped out at # 108 Hot 100 Bubble Under in July b/w If It Ain't One Thing It's Another (Epic/Sweet City 50404), but in August, Feel It In Your Backbone, Got It In Your Feet b/w Jump For Joy as Epic 50440 failed to make either chart.

It's probably unrealistic to think that a distributor would bother putting out a CD version of this album (perhaps Collector's Choice) in light of the fact they are such an obscure gathering, but it is surprising that their one big hit - and a # 23 wasn't a bad result considering the fact that over 450 songs made the Billboard Pop Hot 100 that year - has never even made its way into a multiple-artist compilation covering music of the Disco era. And there are a lot of them out there.",1,0.0

However, Leitner submits his third A+ #24 after five star versions with Kempff and Seemann, so that #24 deserves four stars overall.  I am guessing (only) that Leitner forbade CZ's customary intrusions. In #22 with Kord, though, he has free rein and,I believe, wrecks this great concerto (Mozart's third greatest after #s 24 and 25  I believe). The other movements are mutilated further. Both Brendel/Marriner and Larrocha/Segal and Davis employ ornamentation in their readings, and Brendel does very little of it in his fine version with Paul Angerer on Vox (see my review). However they are ascetic  compared to Zacharias. Of course
this is a subjective judgment, but even if the ornamentation here isn't annoying, other pianists perform the concerto
more effectively, including Brendel/Marriner/Philips, de Larrocha/Segal/Decca, Brendel/Angerer/Vox, Larrocha/Davis/RCA, Haebler/Davis/Philips, Kempff/Klee/DG, Annie Fischer/Sawallisch/EMI, Edwin Fischer/EMI and Peter

5508,"I agree with the other reviewers regarding this set as a whole. I'll just add comments I made on a previous issue of ten of the symphonies on the Quadromania label in the middle of the last decade.

Ernest Bour conducts the SWF Radio Symphony Orchestra in ten Mozart symphonies, 25, 28, 29, 33, 35, 36, and 38-41. The recordings were done between 1964 and 1978, and released on Aurophon LPs. Membran licensed the tapes from Cascade, the owner, in 2004 for this set.

I've listened to four of the symphonies, 25, 29, 35, and 39. The sound is dry and clear. Membran doesn't say when each work was recorded (another issue lists a recording date of January 1978 for 39 and 40), and they all clearly come from different sessions, but there's little difference between them. Bour's interpretations seem very straightforward in the best possible way. He doesn't dawdle in slow movements, he doesn't cover up wind and brass lines but he doesn't emphasize them, nothing sounds rushed.... it's hard to find something strikingly 'right' that Bour does, but that's because everything feels right as it is. I can hear the pitfalls he avoids, for example making the first movement of the Haffner ponderous - Bour's is 'crisp' like Szell, but warmer, less clipped. His 39 reminds me of Szell's as well, although gentler. (Szell was my ""imprint"" version, for what it's worth.) His 25 and 29 are good, and Bour avoids the temptation to be cloying in the latter symphony, but Marriner's early Phillips recordings get more out of these early works and are better recorded and played. Then again, Marriner's Academy Of St. Martins in the Fields is hardly ""big band"" Mozart, so it's not the best comparison to Bour.

Continuing through the set, 40 receives a top-notch performance. 41, which I'm listening to now, is pretty good too, with some wonderfully hushed playing in the second movement. I've listened to 28, 40, 41, and 29 again since my initial comments, and my enthusiasm for this set grows. The sound is slightly boxy, but not to the point its annoying.

Cascade Media had a 40 CD Mozart box available a couple of years ago, which contained the Bour Symphonies from the Quadromania set and this X5 download, as well as the Magic Flute excerpts. I purchased that set for 20 bucks plus shipping, and if you can find it, get it, as it contains the Carmen Piazzini recordings of the piano concertos and piano sonatas, as well as a complete set of the violin concertos. This download is a good alternative if you can't get the Cascade set at a reasonable price.",1,0.0
5509,"This is a very good set of Mozart, and for the price is one of the best deals on Amazon's MP3 site. Germany's SWR (S&uuml;dwestrundfunk, or Southwestern Radio) Orchestra is a quality ensemble and the playing here is all very good to excellent.

It's refreshing that this isn't a ""best of Mozart"" set -- except for some ""Magic Flute"" excerpts, these are all full-length works. And although a number of very familiar pieces are included, such as the Sinfonia Concertante or the Jupiter Symphony, it is not a set of Mozart you've already heard a hundred times.

I did hear an occasion or two where I thought some attacks were a little clumsy -- not intentionally fuzzy as in the Furtw&auml;ngler style, but just a bit muddled. But these were very few and far between and did not mar the set overall. While these are generally not performances that will beat the best out there, they are all highly competent and enjoyable. Very worthwhile as great music well played, and worth a very warm recommendation at the bargain price (right now $4.99, although I paid a little more).",1,1.0

5542,"John Vanore has an ensemble called Abstract Truth that contains some of the more remarkable musicians before the public today.  This, his third album CONTAGIOUS WORDS, is just that - contagious.  Rarely has a big band ensemble demonstrated such cohesive communication while at the same time having each of the members be solo quality artists.  The album has eight remarkable tracks, six of them being compositions by John Dqvore and the other two are well known standards - 'You Go to My Head' and 'Neopolis'.

The performances are clean, well recorded and of the quality that burns on the mind long after each piece is played.  As Davore states 'It's all about storytelling - experiences that bring us deeper into understanding ourselves and those around us.  Music uniquely has the ability to touch us without the use of word or image...and in its abstract existence (the medium of sound) there is a truth in this means of conveying emotion and touching the spirit of the listener...CONTAGIOUS WORDS  collects many of these stories and experiences.'

So off and running is Abstract Truth with some of the most exciting 'big band' sounds around. The members are so important that they all deserve mentioning: John Davore, trumpet and flugelhorn, Michael Mee, alto an dsoprano sax and flute, Bob Howell, tenor and soprano sax/bass clarinet/flute, Joe Cataldo, Sean McAnally, Tony DeSantis, Bill Pusey, Kevin Rodgers - all on trumpet and flugelhorn, George Barnett, french horn, Fred  Scott and Larry Toft, trombone, Craig Thomas, acoustic and electric bass, Dan Monaghan, drums - with Ron Thomas, piano, Heather Fortune, flute, and Jim Daniels, bass trombone.  They are all stars, but the project that comes out to the listener is the gift of the very highly esteemed John Vanore.  Grady Harp, March 11",1,1.0

5559,"WireRose - From The End EP (Independent)
Currently causing a stir in their home state of Georgia, where their unsigned status is the source of considerable bewilderment, WireRose continue unfazed with the job in hand - making music. Their latest, the five-track ""From The End EP"" consolidates their ultra-hip modern rock sound, building upon 2009's ""Waiting"" album and securing their status as a band to look out for.

There's a hint of `epic' in what they do, in their lyrics and playing, the resulting sound might best be described as progressive, though we're talking the Radiohead / Mansun school of prog rather than the `70s version, with plenty of post-punk urgency, especially in the guitars, to dispel any thoughts of excess. Their scale is reflected in the length of their songs; the five tracks here spread out over 22 minutes, though there's hardly a second wasted.

Opening track ""Trip Away"" is simultaneously effortless and abrasive, like classic psychedelia strained through a contemporary mesh. The title track dovetails `80s and `90s indie with right now, and again layers some wonderfully exciting guitar playing, the sort of thing that takes you back to the first time we heard Robert Smith or The Edge. ""Monster"" may lack a little of the intensity of other tracks but more than compensates with a chunky, choppy rhythm and the most insistent of choruses.

5629,"This was of course a unique situation, with Bernstein conducting Cav of all things. Those who complained that he was out of his element here had better check the score. By dusting off many traditional cobwebs, he brought this to life as if it were a new work he was trying to promote. Domingo had previously been scheduled for this production, but the labor problems which so delayed the '69, '70 season produced various temporary defections, including the young Spaniard's. Corelli took over, and did he take over! At that time, young Domingo could never have approached Corelli in this one, particularly in this form and cooperating fully with Bernstein. There's no doubt who's in charge, but Corelli much more than makes up for his relatively sloppy performance on his commercial set of Cav, where his scooping seriously mars the ""Addio"".

There is a common misconception that ""Classical Gas"" was composed and performed by Eric Clapton. Clapton has never recorded a cover of the song. This misconception may possibly be attributed to the fact that Clapton was musical director of, and played much of the guitar music for, the feature film The Story of Us.

5712,"TapWater - Too Dark To Blink (Independent)
TapWater are a six-piece Americana group based in Portland, Oregon, slowly but surely building their reputation through a series of well received releases and a busy concert schedule. Such is their growing status, their latest album, ""Too Dark To Blink"" has attracted various high profile guest turns, including several members of Los Lobos. Indeed, Steve Berlin produces and plays saxophone and melotron. Not two instruments that are naturally associated with an Americana band, but when you consider that frontman Rudy Slizewski also contributes steel drums, xylophone, trombone and marimba, and other listed instruments include lap harp and flugelhorn, it's probably best to chuck those stereotypical expectations out of the window.

Thanks to Berlin's production (and the band's experience) it's somewhat remarkable that ""Too Dark To Blink"" doesn't ever feel cluttered or clumsy. The sound is full and rounded, and the variety of instruments is beautifully judged. When the steel drum makes an appearance on ""Drownin' Without Love"" it's a genuine moment of joy, and they repeat the trick on ""See Ya Maria"", though it's mixed gently with lead guitar. Tracks like ""Frankie Leigh"" and ""Big Belly Blues"" make comparisons with early Wilco and The Band fully justified and the short but very serious, almost classical, ""With My Curtains Closed"" indicates a band willing to take on anything, and able enough to prevail.

5737,"First.  I don't write many musical reviews.  I prefer to spend my time either playing or listening.  Second.  A disclaimer: Yes I am A BW fan; however, I have not been shy about expressing my honest opinion about his various projects.  That said, I love these tracks.  I have always wondered what BW would sound like playing straight-ahead Jazz.  I can still hear elements of the ""Parliament days"" sound.  Those weird ""irks and quirks"" that are BW signatures.  As a matter of fact, I was expecting an all acoustic CD, but was surprised to hear those vintage electronic keyboard sounds.  My favorites are his versions of Take 5, and Watermelon Man. Both stick fairly close to the original melodies, but they are definitely BWs interpretation of the tunes.  I boil things down simply:  Would Herbie Hancock like BW's version of Watermelon Man?  I bet so.  Would Dave Brubeck like ""Take 5?""  I bet.  Antonio Carlos Jobim would appreciate ""Agua de Beber"" ... and so on.  BW's whimsical approach to music reminds me of another one of my heroes: Thelonious Monk.  Both men seem to just hear what they hear, and play what they play.  So I'm thrilled BW is taking a minute to play Jazz.

5738,"OK, it's official: I'm old. I MUST be old; all these people who were the firebrands of my youth are making these discs/records/recordings - whatever you call them nowadays - where they show that they are ""mature"" in some sort of way. What way is demonstrated on this one? Well, none really - if you judge it by the way it sounds. But Jazz, as a signifier, represents something like ""a more advanced, more reflexive musicianship"". I call BS - really! This is a Jazz record the way hearing the theme of Blowin' In The Wind over Muzak in a supermarket is Rock. The only thing that remains from the brilliance that Mr. Worrell demonstrated in the past is an enormous sensitivity to the vast tonal and emotional palette that ""keyboards"" are capable of - he really changed that game, especially in terms of how Pop producers used those instruments. This is audible here, for example, on You're My Thrill where both subtle and not - so - subtle shifts of vibrato function somewhat as they do in the tenor sax playing of a Ben Webster. There are some little pleasures like this to be found here. But they are far and few between. Most of the time, there is a plodding repetition of themes, toneless wanking substituting for improvisation...all of this accompanied by a crack team of top level Downtown New York Freelancers who were, I'm sure, constantly high - fiving each other in the studio between takes, telling each other how ""killing these tracks are"". Well, you can sleep the sleep of the just, henchmen; you did the best that you could do, given the dire circumstances. And, publicist, too, you did your job - NPR profile about how aging Funkmeister goes back to his Jazz roots, etc.,etc., ad nauseum, blah, blah, blah...It's not your fault either. Is it Bernie's fault? I don't want to denigrate the man who added so much genius to Flashlight, Funkentelechy, Chocolate City and so many other Funk Masterpieces. I'd rather just call it - sad.

In this recording the Gran Canaria Big Band pays homage to Broadway musicals with a unique big band sound - with several Gershwin musicals, and to the Count Basie Big Band.  I really enjoyed Laura Sim's singing, with lots of feeling and energy. Fawncy meeting you here and S'Wonderful are two of the highlights. These musicians really know what they are doing, just listen to the solos and big band unison in Spanky and really come out swinging full of energy.

Sure, there is a softness and an overall breezy feel to the bulk of the vocals, but in the end it comes off almost shrill.  It's far too whiney for its own good; resorting to off-putting repetitions (don't make me wait) at the end of the song that make me want to turn it off immediately.  There is a bouncy, almost childlike quality to the song, but the production values are dim, with the vocals taking such a backseat that the get lost in the musical arrangement, which is simply effective but doesn't maintain the pop it initiates (even with the beat switch up towards the end).  There is a moment, before the shrillness takes over, during a pre-bridge (that I want her to stay up for the whole night) where I was actually taken over by this feeling of intrigue, as if maybe this song was going to turn around and then it plunged off the edge of irritation with horrific vocals.

8 years later she releases this vague set of 'yeah, yeah, yeah' (never heard those lyrics in a song before!) mediocre, boring croonings that does not even include a decent performance of Twilight Red, which she performed better on a Prairie Home Companion at the age of 15.  Now it just sounds way too sad in a bad way and too slow and lugubrious.

Her best song - from that night 8 years ago - Don't Rain Much - is not included on the album.

This girl is so lost and confused.  She sounds bored.  She was all motivated and proud then, and now is all vague and uncertain and singing songs about not knowing what truth is.  Very disappointing to hear her sounding  . . . just like everybody else.

I was looking forward to playing my own album and interested to hear more of his crossover music which had been highly praised.  But the disc was a huge let-down, mainly because of its unbalanced mix - all the songs overpowered by a thumping bass and facile orchestration.  His voice is still beautiful and his diction - in three languages - is excellent, but he would have done better to sing a cappella, the mix was so bad.  And then - to add insult to injury - the DVD of Toi et Moi !!!  What on earth induced him to introduce chains, whips and a woman screaming in .... pleasure? Anguish? Who knows?  Who cares?  Whatever it was, it was ludicrous, cliches stacked on top of cliches in a package that would have been offensive if it wasn't so laughable.

First, I listened to my copy by Shaw and his singers: wonderful sound. Then I played this recording. Well, my teacher was AGAIN correct. The sound was very good, if a bit skewed to the left, and the performance was, well...

But each exercise is complicated, like ""Ha-he-hee-hee-la-la-loo-loo-e-i-e-i-oh"" (every syllable a different note). Instead of playing the melody that I need to sing along with, he plays background chords and I am struggling to remember the melody that I am supposed to be singing. Then he keeps interjecting ""helpful"" things during the exercise like ""Remember to relax your jaw"", ""Be sure to breathe properly"". Then I am even more lost because I am still struggling with the melody that I am supposed to be singing and he is talking over the chords and I don't know where I am. Then, during the SAME exercise, he will change the sound I am supposed to be singing, ""Now sing it with ""Yaw-yaw-yaw, instead of Yee-yee-yee"" (or whatever). More frustration and demands while he is pounding out chords and I am lost and I have no idea what the melody is. Not fun. Not helpful. Too confusing. After the third exercise, I just gave up.

I would have rather simpler melodies, stick with the same sounds per exercises, and play the melody instead of chords so I know where I am supposed to be, and stop interrupting.",0,0.0

5844,"""Wired Life"" marked a strong move into a much more hard edged Techno sound for Meisa Kuroki, who has been previously involved in much more RnB styled music. ""Wired Life"" is at 128 Beats Per Minute and it would make a good late night club groove - the verses of the song have an elegantly brooding mood to it contrasted with a powerful but poised chorus. If you like the music of Goldfrapp, Little Boots, La Roux or perhaps Miss Kittin, then you will like this song from Meisa Kuroki. If you're well versed in Japanese music, this song is probably closer to the music of Perfume, Kotoko or Saori@destiny.
Meisa Kuroki sings with a strong clear adult pop-soprano voice with no vocal affectations. Unlike some of her peers, she doesn't go in for the use of vocoders or other electronic vocal treatments of her voice.

There are four versions of ""Wired Life"" offered here - the standard song, which clocks in at just over four and a half minutes. There's an instrumental version, which shows just how good the electronic music is in this song. A mix with dialogue from the anime and a short anime version.

A further version of ""Wired Life"" appears on Meisa Kuroki's more recent single, ""Woman's Worth"".

Hopefully, a new album by Meisa Kuroki is in the works. I think that 2012 will be a big year for Ms Kuroki, and Nami Tamaki, too, whose new single ""Lady Mind"" could be the ""sister"" single of ""Wired Life"".

2012 - I predict that Meisa Kuroki and Nami Tamaki will be doing some great things in the realms of Japanese electronic/techno-dance music.",1,1.0

From the bands Website: Keep You not only offers the desired catchy melodies and strong hooks you can find in other popular music, but more importantly it presents a challenge to its listeners. It is a call to action, a call to love, and cry for revival. With massive guitars, pounding drums, thought-provoking lyrics, and gut-wrenching vocals, Harlend is a welcome addition to any iTunes playlist.

5908,"I recently saw Bailiff in concert (more on that later). Bailiff is a Chicago-based band led by singer-guitarist Josh Siegel, and their musical, while often labeled ""blues-rock"" certainly has blues elements but the music is much more than that. This is the band's second (and as of yet, most recent) album.

""Red Balloon"" (10 tracks; 40 min.) starts off with the short, introductory ""Crickets"", only to then dive in with ""In the Reverie"", an all-out rocker that reminds me of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, yes. ""Everyday Fire"" charges hard too, driven by a relentless bass. Side A concludes with ""Emptied Out"", a slowburner for sure but oh so good. On Side B opens with the title track, a slow, reflective tune that gives Bailiff and us the listener a brief breather. ""When I Leave You Will Stay"" is the most bluesy track on here. ""Overheard"" is the last highlight of this album. Bottom line: Side A rocks hard, and Side Be is more reflective but it makes for an overall great listening experience.

I recently saw Bailiff in concert at MidPoint Music Festival here in Cincinnati. They played an early evening set. The trio's live sound is bigger and more massive than anything you hear on their studio output. I kept wondering how they were able to make the intricate wall of sound, at times prog-reminding music, with just those 3 instruments (guitar, bass, drums). If you have the chance to see Bailiff live, by all means do not miss them! ""Red Balloon"" is a nice album, but let's get some new studio material already!",1,1.0

Celebrasion has kind of a wild crazy, in-your-face party vibe going on, and it's super catchy and fun. Every song packs punch, with snappy beats and belting guitar rhythms.

I can't really think of any bands I can compare Sleeper Agent to. They have a bit of a modern indie sound with maybe a bit of punk, but it has a breezy, carefree quality to it that makes you move. The vocals remind me somewhat of Grouplove or Modest Mouse, which I think is part of what gives them that ""indie"" sound. But the music...

However, from the second the overture stated during the actual show, I realized that this was NOT the soundtrack, not even close. If you are the same as me, DO NOT buy this album, as it is not the musical soundtrack (even though the cover sort of matches the posters.)

It's like a bunch of people -- having no idea there was an ACTUAL Flashdance musical -- recorded a bunch of songs that they had lying around that thought might be in a musical. ""What a Feeling"" is there of course, as is ""Maniac"" (both of which are also in the musical). ""Gloria"" is not.  Then, they add a bunch of random ""80's"" songs, none of which have anything to do with the story. ""Fame"" -- ok, I guess. ""The Rose""... Hm... ""Maria"" from West Side Story... WTF?!? By the time that you hear ""Let The Sunshine In"" from Hair you realize that the producers of the album were tripping too hard during the 70's to notice the transition to the 80's.

Total waste of money-- this is an album of music that is kinda sorta not really inspired by the IDEA of a Flashdance musical. But not good inspiration -- the singing is third rate and the song selection is lousy. DO NOT BUY unless you really like these songs-- but listen to the previews first!

BTW -- There is an actual Flashdance Musical, and it is actually really good, and this album is really an insult to it. When THAT album comes out, I will totally buy it.",0,0.0

5962,"This CD entitled ""Music Therapy For Deep Sleep - Relaxing Nature Sounds and Music"" is produced by Super Audio PVT LTD in Chennai, India and performed by Joseph Vijay.  It is close to an hour long and is structured into six tracks of which five are about 10 minutes long and a single track (Track 3) is only about three and a half minutes long.

Ok, let me say upfront, this is only my opinion.  There are fans of every type of music...music I don't like, others will, and vice versa.  I don't like this CD.  I found it very uneven and, toward the end, impossible to relax to while listening.  The first track, Forest, is pretty good with a single piano composition.  There are bird sounds in the background but they are so soft that they fade away as the piano is playing.  The second track, Surf, is also pretty good.  The composition is played with a piano (or synthesizer?) with some electronic enhancement like reverb.  The surf is loud enough to fit well with the piano lead.  But by the third track, Storm, the CD begins to go off the rails.  The lead is a high pitched piano accompanied by strings.  The storm is essentially white noise in the background with an occasional wind gust that reminds my of a windy dry desert.  The fourth track, Thunder, is jarringly high pitched with strings, winds, and some piano interspersed with thunder.  The fifth track, Waterfall, brings back the piano/synthesizer? with reverb.  The waterfall sound is almost indistinguishable from white noise.  The score is played so slowly that the composition is just occasional high pitched random notes rather than a musical score.  The final track, jungle, brings back bird sounds and a high pitched piano with reverb.  The last four tracks are so jarring that they kept me awake rather than relaxed me.  This is not a CD for sleeping.  It tries for a drifting New Age vibe but completely misses the mark.  The integration of nature and music is poor and the track scores are more annoying than relaxing.  You won't be falling asleep listening to this.",0,1.0

6075,"Listening to ""Come To Mary"" is like taking a trip back to the summer of '69 and the psychedelic rock that was a part of it. I wouldn't be born for 2 more years, but I listen to a lot of Rock from that era. This song is reminiscent of harmonies of Jefferson Airplane, the delicacy of America and flashes of the intricate guitar work heard in the music of Grateful Dead. Take a look at the mystical sounding lyrics and I think you may get the idea:

""Come to Mary; she don't mind.
Come to Mary; she don't mind.
Because everybody gets to have their time,
come to Mary; she don't mind.

To everybody left behind,
to everybody left behind;
the world feels wicked,
but I'm feeling fine.
To everybody left behind...

I'm the one who cannot let go;
how I long to stand beside her golden glow.
Come to Mary; she don't mind...""

Jesse Sykes & The Sweet Hereafter do a good job of recreating this impression of yesteryear, yet it sounds genuine and not an affectation. The song is pleasant and I'm glad for the chance to add it to the playlist on my Cloud Player. It isn't what I would consider a hit, but it has a genuine appeal. The 60s vibe is carried on through the rest of their 'Marble Son' album, so if ""Come To Mary"" whets your appetite, the perhaps it is worth dining upon the full meal.

6104,"Biggs' 1964 recording of the E-flat Prelude and Fugue which is presented here poses many problems.  His use of overdotting in the ""homophonic"" sections of the prelude and taking those recurring sections in a different tempo from the more overtly ""contrapuntal"" sections is both misleading and a misconception.  In the forte and piano alternating motifs near the beginning of the prelude, Biggs renders the three sixteenth notes leading into it as an eighth and two sixteenths, adopting an absurd ""seufzer""-type two-note phrasing in his inimitable ""touch and go"" style of mostly sempre staccato playing, as Melville Smith long ago characterized it.

The fugue---really three fugues, each built upon the other and the last two being double fugues (the second is for the hands only)---suffers from Biggs' obliviousness to phrasing: the main subject, coincidentally resembling William Croft's hymn tune ""St. Anne"" (it is doubtful if Bach knew this tune, which made its initial appearance some thirty-one years before this fugue was written), is broken up at (if memory serves) an upward leap of a fourth between B-flat and E-flat.  I suppose the best thing that can be said about this playing is that it's accurate.  Biggs was fifty-eight years old at the time he made this recording, and the master tape was probably engineered by EPB himself (as were most of his recordings in what is now Adolphus Busch Hall). He was in the throes of rheumatoid arthritis, and often in the flesh was not capable of delivering the kind of performance you hear on this record.  The style of the first fugue (for five voices) always struck me as reminiscent of that of old choral motets, and there are many opportunities for approximating a choral sound on the organ in this piece----mostly a clean legato, opportunities for ""stretching"" (i.e., tempo rubato) and so on.  You will not hear any of this from Mr. Biggs.

The second fugue (manuals only, and challenging for even a seasoned player---if you want the piece to come across with the sense of voice-leading it deserves)---is chopped up and musical lines can only be extrapolated.  The last fugue is just notes.

I should point out that Mr. Biggs made another recording of BWV 552 (in stereo) a few years earlier, on the much larger Schnitger organ at Zwolle, The Netherlands, restored by Flentrop.  It is still wanting, but he took the prelude at a single tempo in that version and (as I remember---I have not heard that record in over forty years) took an expansive approach to the work.  I have not heard Mr. Biggs' earlier recordings of this prelude and fugue (mono era)---but those would be interesting comparisons.

In his own liner notes, Biggs credits the coupling of the Prelude and the Fugue (which respectively open and close the third part of JSB's ""Clavieruebung"", often called the ""Lutheran Organ Mass"") to Felix Mendelssohn.  Maybe.  It was Friedrich Griepenkerl, the first editor of the Peters edition of J.S. Bach's complete organ works, who presented them that way in the third volume of that edition, and made the coupling stick.

E. Power Biggs, for all his faults, was a unique figure in the history of organ performance.  He had guts, drive and imagination, and essentially created his own position.  He came to New York jobless and conspicuously lacking in funds, initially hoping to land a church position.  He contacted T. Tertius Noble, then music director at St. Thomas' Church in NYC, who found him an Episcopal job in Newport, R.I.  Biggs was eventually fired from that job --- it was assumed that, since he was an Englishman, he knew something about training boy choristers (he didn't) and became disillusioned with the church.  Barbara Owen tells that story in her book ""E. Power Biggs, Concert Organist"".  Biggs took another church job in Cambridge, Mass., which remained his permanent home until he died.  He held that church job until the late 1950s, but rarely played services.  He started an ambitious series of recitals, and persuaded the curator of the Bush-Reisinger Museum at Harvard to install an experimental ""neoclassical"" organ built by Aeolian-Skinner in what was then called the Romanesque Hall. He initiated a series of live radio broadcasts from that hall.  Twenty-one years later, this instrument was replaced by the Flentrop heard in the recording under discussion here.  Sadly, the year 1958---which saw the installation of the famous Flentrop, a marvel of an expanded chamber organ---also saw the cancellation of the radio broadcasts and the onset of Biggs' arthritis, which he fought, as best he knew how, for the rest of his life.",0,0.0

6118,"NeverWhas - Solid Will Into Sacrifice (Independent)
A four-piece from Illinois, comprising three brothers and their buddy, NeverWhas are young, hungry and talented. Their music is tough, modern rock, which nods respectfully in the direction of bands like Metallica, Muse and Maiden, though they're instinctively carving out their own sound. Singer-guitarist Mike is in possession of a distinctive growl, the sort of rumble that raises the hairs on the back of the neck, on rock fans and wolverines alike, and guitarist Nik drops solos like glass confetti.

Considering their independent status ""Solid Will Into Sacrifice"" has a vast sound. It's epic and glorious, and no more so than on the title track, which is complex, grand, progressive and systematically heavy. It's an outstanding six minutes and deserves to propel them into major venues. Other tracks are almost as good. ""Listen Closely"" is high energy and aggressively succinct and ""All Tech-no-logic"" releases their inner Sabbath before mutating into something altogether more vital.

If any of the above is of interest, don't hesitate in tracking these guys down. Recommended.",1,1.0

6194,"I consider this one of the great finds of my more than 50 years of  record collecting.  I picked it up in a $1 clearance bin in Asheville North Carolina.  I have owned another recording by Mal Waldron, the 1986 Village Vanguard group with the great Woody Shaw and Charlie Rouse.  Although many consider this Village Vanguard session to be a classic, I found it boring.  So I was skeptical of this recording. Now, I treasure it.
It was recorded in Japan in 1983.
Mal has an unusual piano style, quite unique.  I won't attempt to describe it, but suffice it to say it has elements of Monk, and many other pianists.  Mal's music can be brooding.  The final cut on this CD ""Waltz For My Mother"" falls under the emotion of brooding, and is a lovely performance.
And drummer Ed Blackwell also has an unusual style.  He has taken what I call an old fashioned New Orleans drumming style and turned it to a style suitable to play in the legendary early recordings of Ornette Coleman, Dewey Redman and Don Cherry.  Go figure!  If you can explain how a Baby Dodds New Orleans style of drumming lends itself to the avant-garde, let me know.  At any rate, it works.  Ed's bouncing, elegant rhythm fits in perfectly with Mal's deliberate, searching note choices.
I don't mean to neglect bassist Reggie Johnson.  He contributes fine accompianment, as well as good plucked and bowed solos.

6218,"Wagner was the George Lucas of his day, cribbing bits and pieces of authentic legends into a confused mish-mash of, in his case, fantasy opera, as Lucas later did in space opera.  Wagner was the apotheosis of the Central European late-Romantic tradition's devolution into pure bombastic excess.  As music could not develop further in this direction, in the 20th Century composers turned their backs on Wagner's overblown emptiness, freeing themselves to explore serialism, atonality, minimalism, ambient sound, and other previously unthinkable techniques.

The ""Ring"" cycle has since become a staple of low comedy, with the large, screaming blonde women in horned helmets, and the expression ""it ain't over until the fat lady sings"" (what impatient spectators were told while sitting through interminable ""Ring"" performances).  In ""What is Art,"" Tolstoy gives an outstanding review of an early ""Ring"" production that may be the funniest piece he ever wrote.  His insight is remarkable - it's easy to make fun of Wagner today, but at the time Tolstoy saw it, the ""Ring"" was considered to be the highest art imaginable.  My idea of the ideal ""Ring"" would have all of the characters dressed as clowns, with Larry David as Seigfried, Rosie O'Donnell as Brnnhilde (lip-syching to vocals by Yoko Ono), and Justin Bieber as Alberich.  There should be plenty of pie throwing, banana peels, and eye poking  la The Three Stooges.  With the special effects available today, it should also be possible to show someone skiing through a chain-link fence and turning into a pile of ice cubes on the other side.

Suffering through the marathon of an entire ""Ring"" performance can be of value only to specialists in the history of music or obsessed completists.  Castorf's recent production at Bayreuth in honor of Wagner's 200th birthday was roundly booed by the audience.",0,0.0

Her popularity was from adults starving for authentic singer who can emote adult feelings. She is not Gaga or Clarkson.

6238,"Oh my....how to rate this

First, some perspective:  I love Gilda. One of my favorite movies. I love the movies various renditions of Blame It on Mame, even though rumour has it that is was not actually Rita Hayworth singing.

That said, this version of Blame it on Mame IS the actual solo guitar rendition from the movie...including Glen Fords lead in monologue. It was cut directly from the movie and is NOT a stand alone complete title. As such, it is very disapointing.

Honestly, I could have just recorded it from the movie myself, and I would have done a better job clipping and cleaning it up.

I suspect (though Im not going to bother checking) that the movie and songs are public domain, and that whoever recorded the song, edited it and converted to MP3 saw a way to make a fast buck

So 5 stars for the song, -3 stars for a direct movie rip (and rip off)

Recomendation: Skip it. You may as well rip it from the movie yourself",0,0.0

6255,"Greenrose Faire - Neverending Journey (Independent)
Greenrose Faire is a six-piece medieval folk-rock band from Finland. I imagine live they're an absolute blast, and go down a storm at medieval fairs, and suchlike, but ""Neverending Journey"", their debut long-player, is worthy of attention in its own right. Their jaunty playing, Tomi Hyttinen's songs and Salla Rimmi's classic folk vocals come together to form something that falls between Steeleye Span's finer moments and the hugely enjoyable Circulus. The fact that their record sleeve brings to mind the minstrels in Ingmar Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"" just adds to the kudos.

Unusually for this sort of project, they neither pander to metal fans or proggers. Instead they stick to their own vision of five hundred year old song and dance music, with the latter desire to get an audience moving, an important factor. It's rare that I come across so many instruments that I don't know. These include a dadgad guitar, mandocello, Irish bouzouki and ifteli. If their desire was to worry my spellchecker, they've succeeded on several counts.

There are a number of tracks on ""Neverending Journey"" that I find myself returning to with some frequency. The opening call to arms of ""Dance 'Til Morning Light"" seems to function in the same way as Fairport's ""Come All Ye"" on ""Liege And Lief"". ""Beggars And Thieves"" has all the energy of The Levellers at their most strident (I am, of course referring to the crusty folk-rock band rather than the 17th century English radicals), and not forgetting ""Witchdance"", another floorshaker, and not unlike All About Eve - but considerably more fun.",1,1.0

6266,"I've read several biographies of Rita Hayworth that make a point of the fact that she was never allowed to sing her own songs. Even Robert Osborne on TCM made that point in his intro to one of her movies. The only information I can find on who might have dubbed in the actual singing is from her obituary published in the New York Times, which credited Anita Ellis for the singing in four of her movies (but only listed ""Pal Joey"" and ""The Loves of Carmen""). It's a bit of a disappointment. I love Rita's singing in the movies and the songs in this collection, but how can they pawn this off as a Rita Hayworth collection if it's not her doing the singing?

However, I purchased several of the songs in this collection anyway because I enjoyed Rita's performance in the associated movie. When I listen to them, I see Rita in the relevant scene from the movie.

So the bottom line is: go ahead and enjoy the songs but remember that it is not Rita Hayworth doing the actual singing.",1,0.0

It's not *that* interesting! The organ isn't identified here, and for that matter, most of the composers aren't identified, either. Ellsasser recorded mostly on the large but quite peculiar organ of the John Hays Hammond Museum at Gloucester, Massachusetts. It had the resources to play pretty much anything, but ultimately isn't a very good organ.

The First Ten YearsThe First Ten Years is a series of 10 cds and double 12"" singles by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released between February 24 and April 28, 1990, to commemorate Iron Maiden's first ten years of releasing singles.

Each cd/double 12"" contains two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the b-sides. In addition, each contained a bonus track, a part in the ""Listen With Nicko"" series, in which drummer Nicko McBrain tells about the songs on the discs, in his own humorous way. Each part in the series included a special voucher. Ten vouchers could be exchanged by mail order for a limited edition box in which to store the CDs or records. Although the individual cds and vinyls are nowadays still fairly easy to come by, the boxes are a bit harder to find.

Yep, she needs you to be a lowlife, and she needs to keep distracted from developing the character to be able to entertain yourself; by scripting insincere acts, toying with (fans have given me admissions and confessions) envy/lust, keeping you low and or in the past with scripts that are a pathetic melancholy demeanor, or imitator actor using a phony sex appeal image. Skyler Gray scripted words that were never meant to be delivered in the form of a song format. Why is she imitating singing then...? Go do it! Go script words and act (imitate singing) of the script - you're acting and projecting a fraudulent and insincere form of a message and singing expression. Why, other than to get and that mainstream dream seat, because sing/rap imitation enables national attention and feeds the approval problem. Skyler Gray is certainly not the type of woman to be a leader, as far as somebody who is lived much pain and suffering being in isolation, against their will, and being invisible to the world, because girls like Skyler Gray keep real woman and real singer/rapper unheard and buried.

Heavily influenced by Rancid, Bad Religion, Sublime, House of Pain, & some Rockabilly Soul.  The band is amazingly tight, the drummer is just incredible, & the singers voice.....what can I say.....it's phenomenal!  There's no strain to it or falsetto, it's like Jameson Whiskey, smooth & harsh at the same time.

Their originals are great, fun, pub songs, and the covers they choose suit them perfectly.  And in case you haven't listened to other EP's the song selections suit the Season they were written for perfectly! These EP's are an incredibly original way to put out their music.

6432,"Ok first of all I ordered my copy from Amazon Warehouse Deals. It was listed as Used- Like New.  I have ordered many many things with Amazon, but never have I received such a mis labelled mess as this.  First off the original packaging of the CD's was horribly damaged.  It was dented, scuffed, torn, bent and scratched.  Tape was added to hold the package together which had been advertised as Factory Sealed and there was a sticker on it which said Factory Inspected, which was covering a large amount of the damage.  The CD's appeared to be ok though and I needed them for a Project at the school I work at so I kept them.  When I played them I soon realized that the play lists were not even close to the ones in the listing.... The following is the correct  listing taken from the box.... additionally the cd's had no labeling on them at all so when  I had to transfer them to a holder I needed to  type up a list ... The factory packaging was large and unwieldy and the CDs were not very safely contained in their slips. They were very difficult to remove and even if the original package had been pristine I probably would not have kept them in it. The extra tape peeled off part of the label of one of my cds.  What I listened to sounded ok, but is nothing special.  There was no particular flow of the music and I am glad I purchased another CD which has a much better mix of tunes from the war years

Target does a very good jobb, they play fast and heavy from start to the end, with thrashy and melodic riifs and with some good solos.
The vocal is angry with some high screams here and there typical for this kind of music, but he does a excellent perfomance.

If you like speed/thrash metal from the 80's this is a winner

Target's second album is progressiv and has more technical sound than the debut. The prodction is much better here with a tick and clear sound.

I think there is a good blance between the thrash and the progressiv it all mix very good togheter, its  not to complex and you don't get lost.

The music is filled with good thrash and technical played. They have slowed it a little down, but some track's has also some good speed to it . They change their vocal and thats very sad because is he was very good, but i think the new vocal suits better to this kind of music, he has clearer voice and he sings very good.

6486,"From the HOINH MySpace page (no, I didn't write this!)

What a mixed bag after a few listens to this album. HOINH is a large group, the new wave had some really important records in the past months and weeks. Not enough that these monstrous hits. Let's get in most songs, which you surely know.
It is the definition of the new wave of track and eighties-style, ""Hohohoinhho"". A scenario for a man makes her a star and is on her own. And she leaves him? The participation of the dialogue really captures you and the savvy mix of techno keyboards and catchy is legendary. ""This Is A Gun"" is a fairly optimistic number keypad with a touch of ska feeling, but without the horns. The things this group have keyboards, I'll tell ya. ""I Have A Real Feeling"" is a sensitive love song, and has continued in the direction of the new wave of brilliance, but this time R & B master HOINH a rift in the group. The production is a simple mixture of drum machines and light touch of ivory. A classic era of big hair and their second smash ( ""Space And Time Continuhoinh"" is their first). Their next hit here known to the obscure nature, but if you had an eye on MTV and VH1 for about a month or so in 2007, you have to hear this clubby record with a retro feel in ads for shows reality. ""Cyerscheisse"" is very much like ""N For Nerd,"" but the sound is of a Europe that effort updated dance, which is very plausible, but I do not know, it was could be a huge chart hit here.

They need to know and how these four songs, as I was, and am still, but looked at the rest of the series, and asked: ""Total Hoinh"". Well, the truth is revealed that in this sentence HOINH is really not that the industry is a band, but one of its New-Wave Experiment, worked a few times. The rest of the songs are mostly dark-sounding accounts of love. ""A Fluid In The Light"" trip to Motown ""Karma Chameleon"" (even if this does not come, first served). No one asked for, have they? Trippy request comes as a creepy in ""Banned Electro"" and ""ShakeASpear 4 Shakspeare."" These early efforts together with ""Das Falche Gebot"" are just terrible and dated. ""Banned Electro"" is so much talk here that you think it was a great political song, but it is so dry and pop, that it feels stale rocky.

The not big hits are not so bad, but a required taste, you do not expect here. The fun pop hits here, but are very important and very danceable. For the hits, you might want to be this sentence, but the aging of the eighties synth arrangements pull the album. Also, I know it's strange that I want, that imports, but I found it on a trip and had only musically something different from the United Kingdom. Maybe next time I should for something modern.",1,0.0

6505,"This album from top to bottom is a diverse mix of smooth melodies that provide a unique musical perspective about living in the faith. I think that the sequencing of the songs was on-point and allowed the listener to go through the ebb and flow of the walk that most Christians have. Christon's voice is as smooth as they come and he doesn't ""overdo"" it in any of the tracks. I feel that he is a great blend of what it takes to be a relevant musical voice in the Kingdom.

This is one of those albums where my ""favorite"" song can change day to day. The first song to lead me to this album long ago was ""Isle of You"", which was a title that caught me initially because of it's play on words (as a poet/write, I had to dig that). The song was so amazing to me that I do wish that I would've known about it before my wedding - definitely a wedding song! I have to also say, though, that the title track is one of repentance that I can feel every word of. I have so much love for the Fred Hammond original, ""Mender of Broken Hearts"", so much in fact that I would argue that the remake is just as high of quality as the original, which is certainly not always the case.

After listening to this for a couple of years, I now have gotten caught up with ""Gray's Conclusion"", which to me is just as transparent as the majority of the album, but is the right summation of who Gray is as an imperfect man, but his effort to be the best that he was created by the Father. Truly, it served as the reiteration of the album's title - almost a continuation of ""Even With Evil With Me"" in it's own way.

For those who appreciate musical tastes of Jazz, R&B, and just message with the right message, this album is the one to go with. Every project since has been of excellent quality. Keep your ears open for this man of God, because he has something important to share by way of his gift of music.",1,1.0

He seems to have processed the main vocal with his own slightly de-tuned overdubbed back-up vocal )or applied some sort of effect - sounds a bit like Autotune to me), but the end result is essentially harsh, irritating and annoying.  Nothing smooth or 'groove' about it at all.  It could be that the vocal melody line is just too flat all around, and no vocalist could have saved these songs, but whatever the problem is, this CD is a total miss.",0,1.0
6521,"I'm going to have to break off from the other reviews written here.

I have been listening to John Brown's Body (JBB) for a couple of years now, a really big fan of their sound and performance ever since I saw them live.
From such older classics like ""Garden Tree"", ""Feel"" and even to more recent hits like ""Resonate"" and ""Picking Up."" These songs range from having funky dub, laid back reggae, and all around feel-good music.

Unfortunately I can't say the same for this latest release from the group.
""Amplify"" sounds like an all-to-familiar attempt for the band to go more mainstream to bring in more fans. It's almost as they're trying to hard, with songs like ""Amplify,"" with some joker rapper spitting verses towards the end of the song. A rapper? In Jbb? It sounds as bad as it seems.

On top of this much more mainstream and at some points boring melodies, they also adopt common and overdone vocal lines, evident in ""Push some air."" Just listen to the first verse, and you'll know what I'm talking about.
But not all the songs are complete garbage. The songs I did enjoy were coincidentally the ones that sounded way too similar to previous classics. This is where ""Sky Juice"", ""Give yourself over"", and ""Zion triad"" fit nicely.
The rest of the songs fit in the void of a combination of genres that just don't work. Examples are ""So Aware"", which is a failed take of JBB trying to make a love song for teenagers to croon to each other, with the overuse of string instruments. ""Be at peace"" sounds like it was created for a Disney movie like Little Mermaid, when our two heroes fall in love.

Bashing aside, I would not recommend this album to any JBB fans who enjoy their more classic sound. ""Amplify"" strays far from the path, infusing more mainstream and gimmick sounding genres.",0,1.0
6522,"For over a decade, the American band John Brown's Body has continued to refine and improve upon their authentic roots reggae sound with each of their previous five releases.  Their new CD `Amplify' contains diverse music that continues to direct this positive vibe in a fresh and exciting direction.  The 12 tracks on this release incorporate a myriad of influences ranging from toasting and psychadelia to dancehall, hip-hop and electronica. The instantly recognizable skank of reggae is still prominent throughout most of the tracks, but that usual format is altered, enhanced and cleverly rewoven into a unique sonic hybrid that almost defies categorization.

Elliot Martin, the bands lead singer and front man, possesses a distinctive voice that reveals itself in a multitude of vocalization techniques - powerful intonations and crisp, exact chatting can seamlessly flow into controlled intimacy or combine with his own splendid self-supporting back-up vocals.  His voice, blessed with a warm equalized tone, often is displayed utilizing controlled syllabic fluctuations which would make even the most confident verbalist jealous.  Mr. Martin is also the catalyst behind the well structured and conscious lyrics and he has shown increased confidence in his song craft that was evident on the 2002 release `Spirits All Around Us` and dominated on the excellent 2005 CD `Pressure Points.`

`Speak of the devil' is  a sinister effort built upon a one-drop riddim that warns the listener to be more aware and reconfirms that the righteous shall always prevail regardless of any forms of opposition.  Vaughn Benjamin of the group Midnite contributes a patois-intense vocal towards the end of the track, nicely complimenting the concrete solid dub rhythms.  `Skyjuice,' perhaps the most imposing track on the release, is resplendent with intricately dense horns and tremendous groove-heavy beats from the always impressive drummer Tommy Benedetti.  `Ghost Notes,' infused with a heavy established skanking riff not heard since the days of early Aswad at their finest hour, is a mid-tempo reflective piece that pays due respect to the band's former bass player Scott Palmer, who passed away a few years ago.  The lyrics are poignant and display an ardent compassion seldom found in contemporary song writing.  "" Gave with every note he played, we won't be forgetful. ""

While fundamentally faithful to the reggae vibe, John Browns Body creatively weaves rhythms and beats with layered instrumentation that provides a foundation for complex call and response vocals and splendid brass flourishes. The guitar work is tight and circulates amidst a variety of layered keyboard parts that act as a supportive framework throughout the songs.  Throughout the entire disc, innovative dub-friendly basslines enjoy enlightened interplay with crisp, bouncy drum beats.

The inclusion of exotic instrumentation such as the kora and violin take the galloping track `So Aware' outside the traditional reggae parameters to a subtle, worldly flavor echoing stylistic integrations used by North African Rai musicians.  Another contributing ingredient to the entire John Brown's Body sound are the exception production techniques that meticulously meld the surfeit of rhythms and beats with rich instrumentation, detailed harmonization and an enveloping use of atmosphere.  The editing is stellar and the expressive arrangements are complete with unexpected twists.  Live soundman and studio producer Jason `Jocko' Randall polishes the bands current creations enhancing the cross pollination of numerous musical rhythmic styles.  The result is a new style of music that possesses a vibe always loyal to the mystic, earthly tones of roots reggae while being inventive, groove-heavy and cool.

John Brown's Body have established themselves as perhaps America's most creative and dedicated reggae ensemble.  On `Amplify,' the latest incarnation of the band successfully executes a variety of moods that are ambitious and vibrantly experimental.  With the addition of new band members, Elliot Martin and Tommy Benedetti have embraced a new found sense of purpose and delivered a collection of compositions slightly ahead of its time. The music and lyrics demand that the listener's brain multitask to appreciate the sophisticated textures and depth of arrangements.  However you describe this music: groove music with reggae overtones or dubby electronica fusion roots, the final result is energetic, very original and ultimately impressive.",1,1.0

6535,"No matter the volume, the music of Rancho Relaxo doesnt rise from your speakers, it ebbs and flows, like some thick sonic liquid, barely viscus, pushing and swirling its way into your room, hovering at floor level, then rising up the walls before spilling back down onto itself ... all the while you sit there, eyes glazed, afraid to move, afraid to break the trance, afraid to make any motion that would spur you from the delightful ether laden musical adventure.

This band who hale from Norway, have learned from the best, memorizing with Americana guitar jangles, eastern sitar influences, tambourine trances, and its all held in place by a mystic backbeat thats as primal as it is etherial ... instantly bringing to mind work done by The Beatles on Revolver, not to mention Brian Jonestown.  Yet they do it all without sounding beholding, or under the influence of anyone, delivering a sound thats as dark as night, and surely suitable for any out of body experience you could conjure.

My recommendations [?] ...
-If you don't have one, purchase an Oriental rug ...
-Candles, along with a Lava Lamp to light your way ...
-Heavy Victorian Curtains to block the sun ...
-And finally, a comfortable place to sit, where you can be absorbed by the music ...

Please ... send me a postcard when you get back, I love to hear about your trip.

It at least is a better attempt from Rebecca musically, that she could sing, by not being a flat-head.

I was hoping for much more on this second effort. They did a nice job toning down the Auto-Tune. The real problem is the arrangement. Sounding like it was produced on a 2003 Sony VAIO, the rhythm lurches around like a warped 7-inch of Debbie Gibson's Out of the Blue. Where Friday wormed its way into the pop culture canon with a winning combination of iCarly and MMMbop, this song is ""all about the Becca'mins"" and nothing to do with the things her audience can identify with (or dance to at Junior Prom). Perhaps it can be covered as American Idol's obligatory, abysmal coronation song in 2012.

THIS CD SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE CLIENTS!
i didn't BUY the last cd, but from the few songs i heard off it, i could tell Red Chord had gone in a completely different direction but still kicked ass. that cd must've been ill received because they've clearly reverted back to the production and sound of Clients here.

songs 1 and 2 of FTtTM are amAzing. i had my hands up in the air the whole time i listened to 'em in a ""jesus, it's so brutal i can't take it!"" sort of gesture. i was blown away by the deep peculiar balance of brutality and despair therein. i was TOUCHED.

and then i heard every other song. from songs 3 to 12, Brad Fickeisen uses roughly 3 beats (i'm being reductive on purpose. that was the IMPRESSION i got (that there were no more than 3 beats used), and impressions are worth as much as truth in art, damn it); the riffs become a LOT less interesting; and the vocals are the same throughout (and haven't changed much since Clients, so i'm not blaming Guy too much here).

the lyrics are choppy and at times sappy. ""Face Area Solution"" is a sensitive jam, entreating women (or people in general) not to get facial reconstructive surgery. the singing's BRUTAL in the song, but the nice and considerate lyrics clash too violently, methinks, with that brutality. the rest of the lyrics are just too vague. vocals nevertheless sound good (if not a tad too unchanging).

on a last and hugely all-refuting note:
songs 1 and 2 are so good they're almost worth the 5-12 bucks you'll pay for this cd.",0,0.0

6654,"I rely on hypnosis tracks to go to sleep.  I am also an avid lucid dream participant.  When I got bored of listening to the same two (reliable) hypnosis tracks, I ventured out to seek something better.  I bought this album because of the 5 star review that the other user wrote and was enthusiastic to use it the same night I purchased it.  What could go wrong with a hypnosis album meant for lucid dreaming?

I am not saying entirely that this album is bad. There are good points that I would like to point out. First of all, the script used is very well thought out. The trancey binaural tones in the background are flawless for the purpose of each track.  Unfortunately, all this effort goes to waste with poor mixing.  When the narrator's voice comes in quite suddenly, it is several decibels higher than these tones, causing you to jerk out of that trancey state.  After several failures from almost achieving a wake induced dream state, I began seeing horrifying distorted images of faces in my closed-eye visuals. So what went from a blissful state quickly turned into a nightmare until it was so unbearable I had to open my eyes.

I gave the album a few more tries the following days, but again, I was jerked out of the trancey state and was never able to fall asleep. I don't recommend purchasing this album.  I am not discrediting the usefulness of hypnosis tracks, nor am I discouraging people from trying to achieve a lucid dream.

The first thing I realized was that it is missing several tracks from the album (including 2 of my favorites). And yes, I now see that next to the title it says six songs, and they are making their own compilations (as I also now see in the description ""CD-R Note: This product is manufactured on demand when ordered from Amazon.com"".) So basically, they are burning their own CD's as they are ordered. I really do not care that they are producing them, but please do not put an album cover on the product that NONE of the versions are from. It is misleading. I am 100% positive these are not the versions from the original album. Sarah Jackman's phone number on the original album is 418-9749. On this version it is 418-2792. Not that I am saying these versions aren't funny, just that I wanted the original versions from the original album.

6678,"Chico Buarque owes nothing to anyone--at least, this is true musically.  He has written some of the finest songs to come out of Brazil in the last 50 years.  Chico has synthesized multiples of cultures,untraditional harmonies and classical forms.  His lyric writing has been politically astute and, at times, carefully evasive.  And when writing of romance, myth, or social malaise, he has been acutely intelligent--without pandering to any school or transient phase.  And this doesn't even take into consideration his plays, ballets, novels, and commentary.

Sadly, he has not produced much affecting music in the last 20 years (""Dois Irmaos"" of 1990 is his last worthy effort).  This cd, like his last four or five albums, is an extrusion of meandering melodies and earnest, but uninteresting chord progressions (still--some very nice open-string harmonies). My Portuguese is not as good as it should be, so I don't think I amcomfortable judging his ""letras."" I look forward to a fair assessment from another of his admirers (there are legions, justifiably so).

I will always purchase Chico cd;s because his worst efforts exceed almost anything produced in the pop vein outside of Brazil.  But this one is not memorable.  ""O Quw Sera"" is the apogee of Chico's work.  I don't know if he is capable of reaching that height anymore.",0,1.0

6727,"The rating doesn't not in any way reflect on the merits of Nazareth's output--it only examines this specific product. This seems to good to be true--an mp3 anthology of Nazareth's catalog on one CD. And indeed it is:
1. Although it doesn't claim to be the complete compendium, the anthology is missing two albums--""Close Enough for Rock N' Roll"" and ""The Fool Circle.""
2. The disc, despite the printed legal disclaimers and warnings, is a budged Russian bootleg, and not of a high echelon--the flies do not feature any accompanied artwork--it's bare bones, sound files only.
3. The sound quality is generally fine, except the defect on some files on ""Play 'N' The Game.""
4. In some cases, the albums feature bonus tracks, but in some (ex: ""Expect No Mercy""), they do not.
Even with such shortcoming, it may be worth buying just for the wealth of amazing material that it does have, but don't try ordering it from Round3--you will get a CD of Soviet military choirs, guaranteed. They sent me same wrong disc twice, each time re-listing the Nazareth disc with a price hike, so it went from $11 to now $20.

6729,"Let me say that I Adore Rod Stryker's ""3 Meditations to Live By"" CD (pureyoga version).  They are the backbone of my daily meditation and I use them frequently.  So when I found out that Rod had released this CD of meditations I purchased them straight away, along with Meditations for Inner and Outer Peace.

I have now done all of the meditations on Four Desires.  The Bliss meditation is my favorite in this set. I noticed straight away that 2 of the meditations in this set are ones that Rod has recorded before.  The Healing the Heart meditation on this CD is the same as the ""Empowering the Heart"" meditation that I have on my precious 3 Meditations to Live By CD.  And of course, the Relax into Greatness meditation has been recorded on the CD released previously with the same name.

I found that listening to the meditations with headphones sounded lots better to me than listening to it through my stereo.  Something about running the sound through the speakers seemed to make the little imperfections in sound more noticable.

It's really a great set of meditations.  The only reason I'm giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 is the delivery by Rod.  He just seemed more....caring and into it on 3 Meditations to Live By (as an example).  His delivery on these CDs seems quite a bit more ""business-like"" and matter of fact.  Also, there's no chime at the end of each meditation, so sometimes I'm not sure if the meditation is done or not unless I look at my iPod (transferred the CD).

But a great set overall....recommended.",1,1.0

6732,"I really hate giving a reduced rating, but I have to honestly say, this CD is a disappointment on several fronts.

The first problem is the anachronistic temperament (system of tuning).  It is a Renaissance-era tuning, from at least 100 years before Pachelbel, suited for music of one or two keys, and possibly a very few closely related keys, but certainly not for every key, or the wide variety of keys that Pachelbel (or anyone from his era) composed for.

I was thinking this must be an organ built in the 1500s and tuned with a temperament of that era, which would sound authentic with music by, for example, Scheidt and Sweelinck.  One could certainly play next to nothing by J.S. Bach on such an organ, and little by Pachelbel for that matter.  Now is it possible Pachelbel may have encountered such an organ tuned that way in his lifetime?  Maybe, maybe, I'm not saying it wasn't possible.  But I consider it highly doubtful he would have just sat down on played anything, in any key, on it.  He would have said, 'Oh dear, one of these anciently tuned monstrosities, let us see if we can find a good program only in these complementary keys.'

Imagine my surprise to read the liner notes and find (A) no mention whatsoever of the (admittedly intricate) topic of temperament.  So the user is just left to wonder why the thing sounds so freakin' out-of-tune.  And more surprisingly ... (B) the organ is not from the 1500s at all, it was constructed in 1702.  OK, the shoe has dropped;  the temperament is simply wrong.  That was only 4 years before Pachelbel died;  it was during J.S. Bach's teenage years when he was supposedly doing crazy things like the Toccata and Fugue in D minor and none of them were restricted to those vanilla keys.  I believe all church organs of era, certainly NEW church organs of the era which would attract great living composers and performers, were MUCH more oriented in mild temperaments that were friendly or at least usable in ""MOST"" keys.  I cannot accept this organ of the High Baroque being tuned in this manner.  MY OPINION!

If you want authenticity in old music, the instrument (and temperament) must match the composer's ideal, not simply be ""OLD"".  Otherwise, it's like taking a horse and buggy to the drive-thru window at the 1950's burger joint.  Yes, historic, but totally the wrong time period.

And in case anyone is wondering ... temperament is decided by the tuner, not the organ builder or rebuilder.  So, yes, FYI ... this tuning was set by the most recent tuner.  It could be made into modern equal temperament, or one of the 'well-tempered' Baroque temperaments, by the NEXT tuner (with permission of the owner of course, which I hope they would give).  FYI.

The other problem with this CD is that it is played ""introspectively"" and very little joy or full-organ sound we are used to hearing from decades of other organ recordings.  Why that is, I can only speculate.  It was the organist's decision.

Here are a few thoughts on each track.

(1) Toccata in E minor - does not sound good in this temperament.  Also, played delicately and with many registration changes.  This is a first year piece, quite easy and I would prefer to hear it played robustly, beginning to end.

(2) Allein zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ - in two sections.  The first is not ideal in this temperament, but tolerable.  The second is very sweet indeed.  The music is very simple, I have played it at Lutheran funerals.

(3) Wir glauben all' an einen Gott - This has a highly decorated chorale melody, making it undiscernable (to me at least).  Of course, that is Pachelbel's doing, not the organist's.  I appreciate he is playing it strongly and at a clippy tempo.  This one does not suffer much from the temperament.

(4) Wie schoen leuchtet der Morgenstern - This will be one of the few hymn tunes possibly recognizable by a modern (Lutheran) churchgoer:  O Morning Star, How Fair and Bright.  It is delicately played and easily recognizable.  The temperament is not a detriment.

(5) An Wasserflussen Babylon - OK.

(6) Fantasia in G minor - Temperament sounds OK in this key.  I would have preferred a little more aggressiveness, it is played introspectively.

(7) Ein feste Burg - A Mighty Fortress.  Without a doubt the most recognizable hymn arrangement on this CD, and indeed what I bought the CD for.  This is the piece I played on 500th Reformation day in church last Sunday.  I am sorry to say, the temperament does not do this piece credit--it simply sounds like a neglected, out-of-tune organ.  Or at best, one which Pachelbel would have said, 'Sorry, it looks like we can't use this particular organ for this particular piece' ... in my opinion.  Also I am disappointed it is not played very joyfully.

(8) Chaconne in D minor.  Temperament OK but again not played with much fire.

(9) Allein Gott in der Hoh sei Ehr - How about a nice little single 8 and 2 for a change?

(10) Fugue in D minor.  The chromatic step-wise fugue subject shows precisely why we need a more equal-tempered or at least well-tempered tuning to perform Pachelbel.

(11) Toccata in F.  Once again, far too restrained, although the temperament sounds good here.

(12) Nun lob, mein Seel', den Herren - OK.

(13) Toccata in C minor.  I have just figured it out.  He must have been playing at 1:00 AM and didn't want to disturb the neighbors.

(14) Werde munter, mein Gemute.  Another one of the rare hymn tunes which may be likely recognized by lay people today.  OK, I do not expect fireworks on this piece.

(15) Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her.  Another better-known Christmas hymn, ""From Heaven Above"", which may be familiar to many traditional parishioners ... although not saying it is normally played from Kmart speakers during Christmas season :) Now, get this:  AARGH!  The one piece I would like to hear gently and introspectively, THIS is where he decides to pull all the stops and play full organ.  (It is a conspiracy against me! :)

(16) Meine Seele erhebt der Herren - not familiar with this piece, sounds OK.

(17) Magnificat Fugue Sexti Toni - At last, another fugue played joyfully, high time!

(18) Prelude in D minor - Especially as a closing piece of a recital, he had the opportunity to turn this into a blazing ball of fire, and instead was very careful and conservative.

Note, I mentioned the Lutheran religion several times and only because my first organ job was at a Lutheran church and I have an affinity for those chorales.  Very few of them are done at the other various Protestant churches ....

There is not a great deal of Pachelbel organ music recorded but there are several others available which I own and can highly recommend:

The album consists almost exclusively of ballads...backed up by some of the most beautiful acoustic guitar work you can hope to hear. The songs are mostly about love lost. Ready is the leader of the pack here and has to be one of her best songs ever. It gets ample support from the rest of the material.

The only song that feels slightly out of place is Interior Design, and it would perhaps have been better at the end of the album. The alternative version of To Know You (found on a previous album) is also negligible and not better than the original version.

Unfortunately, the acoustic pop-ballad approach just isn't working for me. I'm sure this will go over big with the audience that bought the (pop music) ""soundtrack album"" CDs for the Batman & Spider-Man movies, but musically, it's just too simple for me. I was hoping for an upbeat power-pop thing with playful riffs and hooks, maybe along the lines of Weezer or The Apples In Stereo, but this isn't it. There's a sameness to it, from one song to the next. The songs themselves are well-written and I can appreciate all the comic book references, but I just can't imagine listening to this more than once or twice. Too bad, but good thing Amazon had samples to listen to. I almost purchased this unheard, based solely on positive reviews and the nerd-band concept. Oh well, can't win 'em all.

6867,"Trace Adkins has always been a first-rate song stylist, able to project huge emotional power and stylistic range.  All of his classiness and talent gets erased, though, by ""More Of Us,"" a bonus track on the ""deluxe edition"" where he embraces the most corrosive aspects of ""tea party"" politics, first playing the victim card by whining about the imaginary oppression of ""us"" true-blue, red-blooded, God-loving, flag-waving Americans and calling for ""real Americans"" to ""push back"" against the nasty people who supposedly hate God and need to be reminded that ""there's more of us than there are of them.""

Now, I'm pretty sure that I have a few political differences with Mr. Adkins and whoever wrote this song, but I gotta say, it really ticks me off to have them talk about me -- and other people -- as though I don't deserve to live in America and that having a different point of view makes me some kind of a traitor. I was born in America, I love this country, I pay my taxes, I go to church and I vote in every election, and I have as much right to my beliefs as anyone else. Talking about ""double-checking"" who the real Americans are is probably the single most un-American, unpatriotic act that anyone could make, including big Nashville stars. We're all Americans, and we should respect one another -- that's part of loving America.

This kind of tough talk and destructive, violent, let's-have-a-civil-war, chest-thumping might sell a few records, but it isn't going to help solve any problems. Frankly I'm disappointed and embarrassed to hear one of my favorite modern artists sink so low. You should be ashamed, Mr. Adkins. This is truly unworthy of your talent. (Axton)",0,1.0

These are they guys that pretty much created ""Space Rock"" with songs about interplanetary craft, tranversing the universe in 80 days, a scientifically accurate song about neutrinos, and a bona fide space rock opera on side two of the album HOPE. Throw in some nice, though odd, love ballads with decidedly Beatle influences, and you have a unique and rather obscure listening experience.

Really, ""Rarities?"" I was a little skeptical, but after listening to this, I am quite pleased. You can't get more obscure than some of these remixes. I mean, who really cares? Well, I do!

I especially like the reworking of ""Silly Boys,"" and the shortened version of ""Calling Occupants"" works well for me. The live set at the end is rather nice, and they have a wonderful live version of ""Little Neutrino."" Good stuff.

An added bonus is an alternate version of ""Hope"" with a little dialogue by the Lighthouse Keeper that appeared lyrically on the LP HOPE on the lyric sheet, but was not on the album. What a nice ""hidden track"" surprise. I was not so impressed with the MAGENTALANE out takes, but I never really warmed to that album.

If you are a Klaatu fan, this is really fun. If you are not, I would suggest starting with the first album or the retrospective PEAKS. The purely instrumental takes are of interest of those of us who know the songs, but the sans vocal tracks might not make a lot of sense to the uninitiated.",1,1.0

In particular the smoldering performance by Hortense Ellis, Alton Ellis's sister, on ""Hell and Sorrow,"" and Errol Dunkley's re-imagining of the song as ""Black Cinderella,"" are worth the price of admission not to mention Big Youth's run on another version.

On top of that, you've got another great Dunkley tune and some classic tracks from Leroy Smart, including of course ""Mother Liza.""

The only drawback, I'd say, is that the versions come so hot and heavy. From ""Hell and Sorrow"" to August Pablo's ""Cinderella in Black,"" all the way to ""Zion Youth"" by Vin Goron, you get 6 versions in a row on the same riddim comprehensive, sure, and unquestionably filler-free.

The song itself has merit, for in parts it is soft and nicely rendered, but there are too many aspects of this track that miss the mark.  The overly repetitive musical arrangement is simple to a fault, especially when the track lasts for nearly eight minutes.  It wears out its welcome by presenting us with no real variations in tone to keep us interested.  The vocals, while interestingly muffled, become almost lazy sounding after a while.

SOUND QUALITY
1. iPad with built-in speaker: Tolerable.
2. iPad with Apple Ear-buds: Obviously limited frequency range, clearly sticks out from other songs: marginal
3. IPad with Sennheiser 500 over the ear headphones: limited frequency range; ""pushed"" dynamic range. Distortion ruins what little of the song which remains.
4. Denon/Martin-Logan/Bi-amped Polk LSi tower speakers: ""Could someone please turn that off?""

PROBLEM
Well, there can't be too much of a problem when the song was less than a dollar, right?  Yet, other songs in the same price range are consistently worth 4-stars in Sound Quality (the limit of sound quality for an MP3, based on the amount of lossy compression applied). What happened?
1. Too much of an attempt to increase the dynamic range through use of a compressor on the final mix-down track?
2. A multi-generation recording, in which multiple forms of compression and conversion had been used. Where's the Master?
3. Product Quality Control. Granted, Amazon QA listeners can only listen to so many songs before their head feels like it's about to explode! I am sure an existing application can be tweaked to analyze each contributed song for preset frequency range requirements, dynamic range requirements, harmonic distortion levels and other audio specifications. Those songs that are rejected, can be listened to, to determine if the song is intentionally manipulating sounds for effects purposes, and passed or failed. To send this song out, at any cost, is a poor reflection of the Music Services offered by Amazon, or any other music distributor.",0,1.0

The music is awesome and features a classic country sound with some blues, honky-tonk and bluegrass influences. All three women share lead vocals on different parts of different songs, and the results are amazing. Their hooks are catchy, their harmonies and melodies are phenomenal, and the chemistry between them is perfect. This is definitely worth a listen!",1,1.0

6939,"Wil pulls together some deep tracks here from the Beatles' huge catalog. His unique interpretations run the gamut of Jazz styles. Some songs are faithful to the original like ""Can't Do That"" which is rendered in a jazzy rock style with the guitar part mixed forward and Wil's smooth tone and beautiful phrasing almost singing to melody to us. Or ""Hey, Bulldog"" a guitar forward piece with staccato three part horn hits. And, ""Fixing A Hole"", the title track, oozing with sweet Cool Jazz lines.

Did I mention that Wil plays all the instruments here? Yep. If you're a musician, listen closely to the guitar chord voicings. His harmonic sense is impeccable. The bass playing is excellent too. Again, Wil hops between styles and creates -- not mimics -- riffs of every flavor.

I've had the pleasure of seeing Wil perform live in Austin, TX when he lived and played here. You must see Wil live in New York where he lives now. He is a humble, gentle, musical genius who has one of the best alto tones I've ever heard. Wil loves and lives music, and there's a light in him of joy that's infectious.",1,0.0

6945,"As with their previous SACD releases, the German recording label Tacet manages to brilliantly capture a splendid performance by the Polish Chamber Orchestra, led by Wojciech Rajsk. The timbre of the instruments feels almost palpable. And that's exactly why this disc is so frustrating. In order to hear these incredible musicians at work, one has to endure the overly affected narration that permeates the performance. On top of that, Prokofiev's original text in Peter and the Wolf was forsaken for a new and extended one as told by an owl, while Saint-Sans's Carnival of the Animals got a totally new narration where originally there was none. These changes dilute the music, robbing the works of their natural continuity.

This is undoubtedly a subjective assessment, since the overall length of this Peter and the Wolf at 31:32 is just a few minutes longer than Andre Previn on a Telarc CD at 27.22. Nevertheless, it does feel like an eternity when one is so eager to hear more of the music, although kids might actually enjoy the experience, and they are after all, the target audience.

As for Tacet's so-called Moving Surround Sound, despite some unorthodox shifts in the placement of the instruments, it is done rather creatively and fits the playful mood of this specific repertoire, at least as far the stereo SACD layer is concerned. Unfortunately though, the narration takes center stage most of the time and left me wishing for Peter and the hunters to leave the wolf alone and go instead after the poor fellow doing the honors.",0,0.0

It is refreshing to see that he is not allowing himself to be confined by the constraints of the label ""singer-songwriter"". Along with this being a more textured album from a musical and sonic viewpoint, it also posses many of Mangan's considerable gifts. He is an insightful, articulate & witty lyricist. His voice also continues to be a powerful emotive instrument. This album is not only worth your attention, but Mangan also deserves a bigger profile (outside of fans of CBC Radio 3).

What I was hoping to get was a compilation disk - containing a number of dnb artists like Teebee and Stakka & Skynet that fall into the nerofunk/futurestep category of this genre - to me one of the most creative, unique and progressive areas of dnb that mix together spacey verbed out sinister atmosphere's, hard, edgy heavily filtered dark and evil synth/bass lines, and beats that are along the techstep line but have more presence and are generally at a slightly slower tempo around 170-175 beats per minute.

While the disk did include the artists I mentioned above, rather than expanding upon the sounds of nerofunk/futurestep Koogi chose to completely soften (marshmellowize if I can coin a term) the experience by mixing a chill, loungy, groove oriented set targeted to the martini bar hipster crowd.

The dark and sinister tones of minor and disonant keys used in nerofunk/futurestep were transposed to more ""easy on the ear"" sounding major keyes - the pads were joyous and elated instead of being mean and ominous.  The basslines were subdued instead of hitting your mind like a right hook, and gorgeous sounding female vocals were overlayed throughout, which I just don't get as this ain't supposed to be HOUSE.

In conclusion, if you are looking for a good neurofunk/futurestep experience, take a pass.  If you want to try out something in dnb and like chill grooves this may be interesting to you.

On a final note, Koogi does mix well, the quality of the sound is very good and I received the CD very quickly even though it came from Eastern Europe.",0,0.0

There are sides to Him that I need to know; that I don't know it all, but I can go on a road of discovery and rediscovery of God.

6997,"OMG, I just listened to the sample of this soundtrack, and I honestly can't imagine sleeping to this, even if I was really, really tired. Much less using it to go to sleep if I was having insomnia....

For soundtracks that actually work, you want something with Binaural Beat Technology built in, and a soothing backgound sound. Excellent ones you can get from Amazon include Kelly Howell's one with the identical title, Slow Wave Sleep, with a ocean wave background. And if like me you find ocean wave sounds less than ideal, Kelly's Sound Sleep has a very restful musical background. Just type Kelly Howell into Amazon's search box.

Sadly, Amazon doesn't have samples of Kelly' soundtrack's on it's site, but Kelly's site does. Google BrainSync. You can listen to samples there, and buy an MP3 download cheaper than a CD. But if you want a cd rather than an MP3 download, come back here to buy it, since Kelly charges too much for shipping and still takes a while to deliver.

It's a matter of debate among producers of soundtracks, but some people claim that a CD will work better than a MP3 copy, since the binaural beats are compressed in a MP3. Possibly true, but the MP3s do work. Do they work as well as a CD? I really don't know....

Be aware that these soundtracks are designed to slowly take you down into the sleep state, gradually going deeper and deeper. If you are having trouble going to sleep, listening to them will most likely get you there. Even if not, you will at least get very calm, which is much more restful than tossing and turning. But listening to them over and over all night will be counterproductive, since when the soundtrack starts over, it returns to the ""awake"" level, and then spends some time ""taking you down"" again.

Another use is when you need a ""nap"" in order to be awake and alert later, or simply don't have time for a full nights sleep. These soundtracks will help get you rested and energised.

Warning: binaural beat technology works by putting different sound frequencies in each ear. So unless you have a stereo source, at least moderate hearing in each ear, and use stereo headphones they won't do anything at all.",0,0.0

7011,"Big Village calls their style ""tribal pop,"" which basically means that they produce funky rock with quirky lyrics, world music influences, full, female vocalist harmonies, and a great rhythm section with some African drums. If you can imagine a cross between the Talking Heads of ""Stop Making Sense"" (only less weird) and the Brand New Heavies (only without horns), you'll get the general idea. On the group's third album Up, singers Rachel-Ann Cross and Jaqui MacMillan, backed up by a stomping, soaring orchestra led by bassist Henry Cross, prove that hope is still alive, at least in the Washington D.C. suburb of Takoma Park, MD. Our ladies of song show that they are nothing but attitude -- good attitude, for a change. The lyrics are clever, as on the rhyming, silly song ""Whena, Whena"" or the poetic ""Woman on the Way to Heaven."" Just when you're wondering where that world music influence went, it comes out in full force in the passionate Arabic-rock number ""Euphoria.""

I think this was supposed to be their second and last release that actually was not released until a few years after it was recorded.  After hearing it, Im surprised it was released at all; but like I indicated the 4th song, which I guess was side 2 of the original vinyl clocking in at 19:51 minutes, is somewhat listenable (I say only somewhat).  I was thinking about also getting their first release, but NOT anymore after hearing this one.",0,1.0

7075,"Burning Sky Records - the label that has already released killer tributes to Jellyfish, The Posies, Roxy Music (with a tribute to NZ's Toy Love coming in September) - is back with their most ambitious tribute yet.  If I.... If I... If I... The Songs of Squeeze Revisited is a 4-disc, 50-track album covering Squeeze's first four albums (U.K Squeeze, Cool For Cats, Argybargy, and East Side Story) in their entirety and in their original track sequence.  Check out the songs of Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook in a whole new light - it is a fabulous listen!  (The 4-CD album is ONLY available from the Burning Sky Records website).

Released in 1977, the John Cale-produced U.K. Squeeze introduced the world to the magic of Squeeze.  The album presented Squeeze at their wildest - they had an edge to their sound that was unique to this record.

Covering an album like U.K. Squeeze would be a challenge.  We strove to capture the wild abandon of the original album while giving fresh life to each of its songs.  Here's a brief take on the tracks, with some thoughts from the bands/artists themselves:

1.) Sex Master - After a gorgeous, Jellyfish-esque opening, US band Steve Sizemore Group rocks the heck out of the album opener, with guitar, piano and Hammond organ all ""rocking it out like the world was coming to an end.""

2.) Bang Bang - UK band Keshco provides a fun, quirky take on the song, ""playing up the whimsy in the verses and the yearning in the choruses,"" with a ""funk-out at the end"" to ""top off all that pent-up frustration.""

3.) Strong In Reason - US artist Christopher Watson provides an updated New Wave take on the track.  ""What started out sweet and tentative became edgy, taut, and mechanical,"" Chris says. The track also features cool angular guitar from Trees' Dane Conover.

4.) Wild Sewerage Tickles Brazil - Japanese band Penny and Ashtray take a surreal approach to the album's lone instrumental - they strove to ""represent the song's alter ego in a parallel world.""  Their cover has all of the delicious creepiness of the original version.

5.) Out Of Control - Speaking of ""creepiness,"" US band Trees amps up the creepiness appropriate to the lyric while at the same time making a very catchy cover.  Trees' Dane Conover wanted listeners to have ""little beads of sweat trickle down their forehead"" when listening to this one.

6.) Take Me I'm Yours - US band (by way of England) Sartre's Lobster give this classic Squeeze track a decidedly Middle Eastern feel, using the song's ""lyrics about bellydancers, camels and the Golden East"" as a starting point, swirling with a ""a kind of '70s, vaguely Led Zeppelin-esque vibe.""

7.) The Call - US band Robert Mag & The Number Nine put a powerful, Bowie-esque slant on this track, rocking it up more than the original version - very cool stuff.

8.) Model - UK band The Slingsby Hornets amp up the energy on this track, employing ""a Brian May multi layered guitar feel, over a 90s influenced Redd Kross style powerpop/glam backing, with the addition of a few analogue synth sounds.""

9.) Remember What - Spanish (by way of the US) artist Amelia Ray considered numerous potential approaches to the song, ""but the funk won out"" on this inspired cover. The majority of the song is sung in 7/8 time, with the bridges switching to 4/4.  It is funky indeed!

10.) First Thing Wrong - US band Ocean of Algebra ""took a very loose and open approach to the song, and ""ended up getting kind of an Ocean of Algebra does the New York Dolls does Squeeze type of sound.""  Singer Jim Hiskey's vocal is not to be missed!

11.) Hesitation (Rool Britannia) - US artist D A Karkos takes what I always felt was a so-so song from U.K. Squeeze and turns it into something amazing. Karkos says, ""My approach to this song was pretty simple. I wanted to make it more of a hard rock song and less of a jam. Slowing the down the tempo and coming up with a new riff that worked over the original chord progression seemed to do the trick.""  I'll say!  This cover is flat-out sick!

12.) Get Smart - US artist Wayne Cabral closes the disc with a blistering take on the track, dialing up the energy while maintaining the ""punkabilly"" feel of the original.  Clocking in at just over 2 minutes, this track (and disc) will leave you wanting more!  Good thing there are 3 more discs to go... :)",1,1.0

7108,"It's about time I shared my life-changing experience with three of Michael J. Emery's recordings:

1.  Complete Confidence 2.0
2.  Put Off Procrastination
3.  Sheer Resolve To Do What It Takes

- Did these three recordings alone change everything? No.

- Did they start me, and then keep me, on a path I was previously unlikely to take or stay on without them? Yes!

- Had I tried similar recordings, such as hypnosis and books, to accomplish the same things, and did Emery's recordings prove by far the most effective? Yes!

At the time of this writing, September 17, 2015, I have never met nor communicated with Michael J. Emery. This testimonial comes from the influence of the recordings themselves, listened to over a period of about a year.

The two elements I believe stand these recordings out from others like them are:

1) The music and sound effects that accompany Emery's verbal instructions and imagery. The music is, in my experience, simultaneously relaxing and stimulating. In fact, listening intently, fully conscious, to each of these recordings and their instructions at least twice is an excellent way to learn how to call upon their techniques during a normal workday without the recordings.

2) The most effective image/sound effect for me personally, in any audio recording I've ever listened to, is an ""ice cube"" metaphor on ""Complete Confidence 2.0"" designed to gather, freeze, and put away all thoughts of previous failure, so that I could proceed building confidence without mental hang-ups from the past. My unconscious truly responded to this metaphor.

With these recordings, I was able to build ""Complete Confidence"" in a way I had not been able to sustain before under pressure.

This prompted me to ""Put Off Procrastination"" and act on a number of decisions I had waffled over before, which prompted me within a short time to seek out and then join a public speaking club which I still belong to, and led me soon after to apply for promotion to a leadership position I had not fully seized the first time it had come around, increasing my income significantly.

For those with a ""fear of success"" similar to what I felt for many years before seeking out and listening to these recordings, I won't lie to you - bold decisions lead to responsibilities that can be difficult to stick with once assumed. ""Sheer Resolve To Do What It Takes"" kept me on the path, bolstered me in refusing to give up, and kept me focused on thriving rather than just ""getting through"" challenging situations.

""Complete Confidence"" continued to bolster that indispensable element, and ""Put Off Procrastination"" continued to provide tangible effects that prompted me to act on, and drive steadily to completion (or lead others steadily to completion), important tasks that had lost momentum but still needed to be done.",1,0.0

7114,"This is a review to Verdi's La Traviata, recorded in 1941.  I see it is already attached to La Boheme, and Lord knows where else, by Amazon.  It is their doing, not mine.  Now about this Traviata ...

I am a big fan of Jan Peerce and particularly regretful of the fact I didn't go hear him live, although I had the chance staring me in the eyes and stepping on my toes.  It was about 1980 and he was doing Traviata at Scottsdale Center for the Arts.  I was all dressed up and ready to go, and then I read a review in the paper which said it was ridiculous to have a 76-year-old Alfredo hobbling around the stage with a cane.  And so, because I was stupid, I thought, oh dear--I don't want anyone to see me there, if the reviewer thought it was bad.  And so I missed out.  Now he is dead, and the moral of the story is:  don't be stupid, and miss out.

Well, this particular recording is interesting in a way, but mostly because it's surprisingly mundane.  Peerce is Peerce, he does a great job, but there's nothing shocking or new.  If you have Toscanini, then you have Peerce (in much better sound).

Let us put to rest the very pleasant myth that everything that came from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera, during the Golden Age, was automatically a masterpiece.  This is without a doubt the scrappiest (note the politically-expedient leading 's' on my chosen adjective) Traviata ever to come from a leading house.  The conducting is uninspired, to put it charitably.  The tempos are mostly S-L-O-O-W-W, and it is simple time-beating.  Now when I say 'mostly' slow, that implies that some of it is not slow.  That is true.  The Dr. scene is the most hurried Dr. scene ever to grace wax.  This guy was REALLY late to a golf appointment, or maybe he had to go to the little boy's room.  Whatever it was, he had to get the heck outa there, FAST.

About the Violetta, who I have never heard of (not that that means anything).  She is labeled as a soprano, but I swear has the beautiful, well-rounded voice of a mezzo.  And guess what else?  She doesn't do any top notes.  Have you ever heard a Violetta who avoided the top notes?  I'm not saying it's bad, but certainly is unusual.  There is something else a little different.  She uses some different words.  In Fors'e lui, she doesn't sing ""Gioir! Gioir!"", she sings ""Aaaaaah! Aaaaah!""  And there are other words she uses in certain areas, but I don't know what they are.  That is certainly different.

Altogether it is an unsettling Violetta and I will have to say, if she could sing Violetta at the Met, so frankly could any of the talented ladies singing Violetta at community opera I know with no apologies whatsoever.

Lawrence Tibbett is father Germont, and I am sure you are aware he is one of the greatest baritones of the 20th century.  He is giving it everything he has, and it actually detracts.  Yes, I am afraid it is an odd mix to put him in this mediocre production.  It is like having a New York Steak with potato chips and diet orange soda on the side.

The score has been cut, of course.  The standard cuts are taken, and then some.  Even the parts of the two messengers ('La signora e partita', and 'Una dama d'un cocchio') are cut.  Alfredo just asks who's there, then proceeds to read the letter.  So you are telling me at the Metropolitan Opera they didn't have anyone who could take these 10-second messenger parts?

Now about the sound.  The sound is very good for the age, up until the last act.  Of course, it is not as good as Toscanini of 1946, but then again, nothing of that era is.  It's certainly as good as, actually better than, the live Callas Traviatas of 15 years later.  Then beginning the last act, there is an annoying series of ticks or bumps that won't go away.  When it first starts, one might say it's not too bad.  But it goes on the whole act, and it strains the limits of tolerability.

So the good stuff here is Peerce as Alfredo, which can be best enjoyed with Toscanini, and Tibbett as Germont, which is better enjoyed with Ponselle.  The rest of it is altogether 'meh'.  Of course, it is cheap, but the question is, do you want to spend the time and sanity when there are SO MANY truly excellent Traviatae out there??",0,0.0

7160,"The songs on THESE ARMS contain a number of influences - folk, country, blues, Cajun (reflecting Mark's heritage).  One of the wonderful things about this talented duo is how seamlessly they can blend these, sometimes within an individual song, into a viable whole that is simply great music that not only touches the soul of listeners, but brings nourishment to their minds as well...not to mention inducing them to a good bit of foot-tapping in the process...and the urge to dance.

Seven out of the eleven tunes on this album are Mark Viator originals, and they clearly illustrate what a fine writer he is.  He's also a very talented guitarist - almost all of the guitar work on the recording is Mark's.  Whether he's fingerpicking or flatpicking, or playing slide, it's always masterful and appropriate, and never showy for the sake of it - it's all about the music and what supports it best and conveys the mood.  When Mark shifts from accompanying lyrics to adding a spot of lead, the seamlessness is wonderful to behold.  If you're fortunate enough to see them perform live (which we do every chance we get), you'll understand this even more. The songs here that were written by others (Thad Beckman, Robert Earl Keen, Kate Wolf and Hank Williams) are as well-chosen as the originals are well-written, and suit Mark and Susan to a T.

Mark's Cajun heritage is never far from the surface.  `Queen of the bayou' is a heartfelt tribute to his grandmother, a tasty stew of memories and love.  `Ain't goin back' is an honest look at the life of a proud Louisiana working man, a vivid picture of resilience and devotion to family.  `Dharma bums', as one might gather from the title, was inspired by Jack Kerouac's novel, and wonders eloquently if the idealism the book inspired in many of us when we read it the first time can be carried and kept alive as our lives move along.  Susan's voice carries Mark's original `These arms' to sweet heights - it's a beautiful love song, extremely moving, and one you'll find yourself humming it before you realize it.  Her renditions of Kate Wolf songs (`Across the Great Divide' appears here), as well as those of country legends such as Hank Williams (`I'm so lonesome I could cry' gets a beautiful reading on this album) and Patsy Cline (if you're lucky enough to see them perform, ask for `Walkin after midnight'), are all nothing short of wonderful, and Robert Earl Keen's `I would change my life' illustrates that she can give new life to more contemporary songs.  She makes everything she sings her own, reaching down into her artist's soul to color them with shades from her own palette.  When the two of them blend their voices, the harmonies are perfect and the chemistry is intimate - you can get a sense of it from just listening, but again, seeing them perform in a live setting makes it abundantly clear that they love what they're doing.

Many of Austin's finest musicians lend their talents to this recording.  It never feels over-crowded, rather like a conversation among good friends, where everyone has something to contribute but no one attempts to dominate.  Every track flows easily along, without production getting in the way of the material.  As I said earlier, this is simply great music - well-written, performed with heart and talent, and a complete joy to experience.  Pass it up at your peril.  I don't think I'm allowed to insert a link to their website here, but if you do a search for them, you'll find it - there are samples available there, and you'll hear what I mean.  If you like what you hear - and if you enjoy great music, I feel sure you will - check out Mark's earlier solo album BAYOU TCHE, filled with more finely-crafted original songs (one co-written by another great Austin-based songwriter, Slaid Cleaves), and his solo acoustic guitar offering WIRE & WOOD, showcasing his instrumental talents.  They're both excellent.",1,1.0

7167,"As a fan of the show, and owner of the entire series on dvd I can say this box set is well worth getting. I also own most of the other next gen cds, as I'm a completist. It's presented well. One of the highlights of the set is the huge booklet which talks about each episode presented. Lots of colour photos. It talks also about each composer. One composer for the first 2 discs, then guest composers for the third plus extras and alternate takes. I liked hearing Picard's voice on the main title. It would be great to get some more naration in other soundtracks. I always thought that It would be a good idea. Scary, light hearted, comical, soaring and interesting is some of the words I could use to discribe the music. A track from ""The Big Goodbye"" was one of my favourite pieces as I like music from film noir and detective stories from the 1940's. I think the music from the next generation is magical, exciting, futuristic and cutting edge like the visuals in the show.",1,1.0

7169,"Sangre's new album the Great Tribulation is seriously one of the Best Metal albums I've bought in 2011. I like every song on here. The songs are really heavy and make you want to Headbang until your head falls off. Every song is great but if I had to pin Point my favorites they would be the first track ""Vengeance"" It's straight up Death Metal with some Black Metal elements added to it. The Vocalist growls mixed in with his High Pitch Black Metal Screams makes this song stand up to it's name. It's full of bloody Vengeance.
The Title track ""The Great Tribulation"" intro riff is sick! Another very Death Metal and Black Metal influenced track thrown in with some very Gutenberg Swedish Melo Death inspired riffing reminiscent of At The Gates mixed in with some Dissection.  Very Heavy but Melodic at the same time. Another stand out if I had to chose, and trust me it's hard to pick a song cause they are all brutal and awesome would be ""Forever I"" This song if I had to describe it would be Thrash Metal meets Tool. This song is really heavy and makes you want to thrash and get stoned! The vocalist mixes in his growls and screams with his melodic vocals. Not many Metal vocalist can pull this off but his voice is great. hahahaha. Sangre mixes their Thrash Metal/Death/Black Metal influences really well with the great Melody of Swedish melo death with a dash of progressive Metal. Seriously all 13 tracks make you want to headbang and circle pit. Also the Drumming is freaken excellent. Great crazy Fills through out the songs. Reminds me of Danny Carey Meets Dave McClain of Machine Head on crack with great Blast Beats and Double Peddle Action! Oh and to top it off, The Bass is actually played the way it should be, playing along to the Drummer! I GIVE SANGRE'S THE GREAT TRIBULATION 10 OUT OF 1O! METAL AT IT'S FINEST. i WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO FANS OF TOOL, MACHINE HEAD, SLAYER, AT THE GATES, PANTERA. I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL HEAVY METAL FANS! THIS ALBUM REALLY MIXES IN WELL ALL THE DIFFERENT GENRES OF HEAVY METAL! FOR FANS OF THRASH,DEATH, BLACK METAL AND JUST METAL PERIOD!",1,1.0

7211,"myron sharvan is another amazing Buffalo NY  icon who has broken through with this debut offering as the leader of world coyote project.myron has miles of nationally recorded band names in his back pocket where he was a studio ace guitar guest.he had a vision and went about the task of assembling some of todays greatest names who form world coyote.myron does things one way....""THE RIGHT WAY""....from his creative writing,and composing  to picking an all star cast of musicians who share his extraordinary creativity.he has an unusual but finely tuned idea of what he wants to play and record.his music opens the eyes and ears of his already huge local following and new fans that have jumped aboard the world coyote project train.he does this by not compartmentalizing this project into a specific genre.he has something for everybody here.staggering blues riffs,melodic instrumentals ,power guitar driven classic ""hit ya in the gut"" rock.he has mastered his own genre,as most of todays truly gifted artists are opting to do.the face of rock will continue to break off into new tangents daily,with the emphasis on delivering the goods you want and will keep.
As for the players ,i mentioned myron did not go halfway. HE'S ALL IN....he shares guitar duty with Phil Brown,the guy who has shared studio and stage with such names as little feat,and the latest Kool and the gang release.he has written for the likes of Cher,Kim Carnes,Kix,Bonnie Tyler,and Steve Perry to name a few. James Anderson holds down his half of the rhythm section as bassist. James has rocked with both Winters Brothers and their bands,Arc Angels,The Stratoblasters,and numerous other nationally recorded artists. Jimmy ""Z"" Zavala,has added spice to many quality artists works. Dave Stewart of The Eurythmics fame calls ""Z"" the greatest harmonica player in the world. That is an accomplished resume,but to add to his list he wasn't passed up by Rod Stewart,Bon Jovi,Tom Petty,Yes,and with his saxophone skills he adds zest to alot of our favorite artists music.""Z"" has been named Etta James' ""hoochie coochie man"".Bruce Bowland fronts this amazing group of talent. Bruce founded and performed with the Blackbirds who featured a guitarist by the name of STEVIE RAY VAUGHN!
As for the music this is an intoxicating blend of finelyweaving golden laced amazement.""Almost Home"" the title song is the killer on this writers review of the whole cd.it'll drive ya to tears,it is one of those songs that won't leave your mind once its gotten in. What is realized here is that it is possible to be powerful without pounding wattage down your throat,as is exemplified in ""SNAKE BITE"".The lead off song ""SHARE THE BLAME"" is another example. A well written song lyrically,a song for the thinking man,but what is so spellbinding is how myron phrases the guitar work on the intro. An old rock/blues trick that gives you some insight into its soul,the lead break guitar solo. After this solo the power of the band blends beautifully to climax and finish your best girl off.myron is no show off guitar player ,he just plays with his heart and soul to give you absolute harmony laiden music.""LONG SHOT"" is another well constructed piece of this beautifully created puzzle in which all the seamless soulful wonderment comes together to reveal the tapestry that is myron sharvans ""WORLD COYOTE PROJECT""

7276,"Although Mozart's prolificacy was lifelong, 1784 was a special year for him. During this annus mirabilis, Mozart wrote no less than 6 piano concertos (all masterpieces, K.449 through K.459), the Quintet for Piano and Winds K.452 (in Mozart's own words, the greatest thing he had ever written), the great C Minor Piano Sonata (K.457) and the ""Hunt"" String Quartet in Bb (the fourth of the six ""Haydn"" Quartets). All of this in less than 12 months.

During this remarkable year, the 9 weeks between 2/9/1784 and 4/12/1784 stand out, transcending mere fecundity:

February 9, 1784: Mozart completes the Eb Piano Concerto K.449
March 15, 1784: Mozart completes the Bb Piano Concerto K.450
March 22, 1784: Mozart completes the D Major Piano Concerto K.451
March 30, 1784: Mozart completes the Quintet for Piano and Winds in Eb, K.452
April 12, 1784: Mozart completes the G Major Piano Concerto K.453

This is astonishing - some might even say miraculous - even for Mozart. In recent years many scholars and musicians - particularly of the HIP variety - have sought to demystify Mozart, to knock him down a peg or two. Musicologists have been keen to point out his flaws and seem obsessed with the prosaic details of his life and work, and HIP practitioners have endeavored to bring Mozart ""down to earth"" with roughed-up, sweaty, ugly sounding performances. The goal seems to be to endlessly remind us that Mozart a mere mortal. The Zeitgeist commands that we scoff at notions of divine inspiration. Mozart was nothing more, the musicologists tell us, than a very clever man.

Yet when we listen to the music we know better. And in spite of their ongoing efforts to mortalize Mozart, no musicologist has been able to sufficiently address the miracle of 1784. How did Mozart do it? How could any man create no less than 5 masterpieces in less than 9 weeks? It is one of the great mysteries of the universe, and one that no scholar, no matter how learned, will ever be able to answer - just as physicists will never be able to explain the deepest questions of existence.

This recording is a hidden gem of the catalogue. It pairs Walter Klien - one of the keenest Mozarteans who ever lived - with Stanislaw Skrowaczewski (SS) and the Minnesota Orchestra. Klien's way with this music is wonderfully idiomatic. His instrument of choice was a Bosendorfer Imperial, which allows for fortepiano-like transparancy without the hideous sonorities associated with period instruments. Klien is a master of legato - each note sparkles, but his touch is percussive enough to make Mozart's keyboard lines both sing and dance.

As a ""B"" label, Vox employed some scruffy regional ensembles - some not much more than pickup bands - to record the Mozart Concertos with Klien (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Complete-Solo-Piano-Concertos-The-Voxbox-Edition/dp/B009T2XPC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart: Complete Solo Piano Concertos (The Voxbox Edition)</a>&nbsp;In the 60's and 70's he was paired with the Mainzer Kammerorchester with Gunter Kehr (K.414, K.456, K.467), the Pro Musica Orchester Wien & Paul Angerer (k. 449), the Wiener Volksoperorchester with Peter Maag (K.451, K.488, K.491, K.537). In each of these recordings (none of which have been remastered to date) Klien shines, but the B-grade orchestras sound sour and rough. Whether that is more a function of poor engineering than the artistic shortcomings of the ensembles, we cannot know. Either way, it is a shame - considering Klien's immense talent - that these recordings sound as rough and harsh as they do.

Thankfully, we at least have this disc, the only Mozart Concerto performances featuring Klien in which the orchestra and sound engineering rise to the occasion. In K.453, SS leads the Minnesotans in spirited readings of the outer movements, and the Andante is full of such exquisite beauty and refinement that it qualifies as a ""postcard from Cythera"" (as reviewer BO'H would say!). Klien's playing of the Andante cadenza is deeply contemplative - and on his Bosendorfer, we get to luxuriate in those deep bass notes. SS's crisply articulated Rondo is a joy - both Klien and the ensemble impart a sparkling vitality to the Presto interlude at 5:20. This Presto interlude is one of Mozart's best surprises, and a archetypal example of what makes Mozart Mozart. Overall, there is an abundance of energy in play here, and happily, a lot of it is supplied by the Minnesotans.

K.595 has long been a subject of debate. Today's musicologists sneer at the notion that Mozart intended it as a farewell; accordingly, the HIP movement usually deprives their readings of this concerto of any sense of valediction. While the musicologists may be right, the HIP practitioners are surely wrong to play K.595 prosaically.

Whether Mozart realized it or not, the Bb Concerto he completed on January 14, 1791 is indeed his farewell to the genre. Alfred Einstein argued passionately that Mozart seemed to have a premonition about his fate; while we may never know if this is really true, the music itself tells us that Einstein may have been right after all.

Right from the start, the cellos and basses underline the Allegro with a sense of gravity. The happy tunes that follow are thus tinged with sadness - the sun is shining, but for the last time - and this signals that Klien and the Minnesotans see K.595 as more than just another item in the Koechel catologue, its status as the final piano concerto being something more than mere coincidence.

Any doubt one might have about the valedictory nature of this work is removed in the Larghetto - a vision of eternity - and Klien and the Minnesotans play it with a wistfulness that makes the heart ache. The Rondo, playful and childlike - a longing for the days of innocence - is sweet, charming, innocent, and sad. Arthur Hutchings wrote that ""the sun never sets on any of Mozart's four piano concertos in Bb"" - this is undoubtedly true, but in K.595, twilight is nigh.

This pairing is serendipitous. The sound is good, and the performances are brilliant. Marvel at the miracle of 1784. For 62 enchanted days, time let Mozart ""hail and climb / Golden in the heydays of his eyes...""

""... And honoured among wagons I was prince of the apple towns
And once below a time I lordly had the trees and leaves
Trail with daisies and barley
Down the rivers of the windfall light.""

Other highlights include ""I'm Going To Go Back There Someday"" by Rachael Yamagata, ""Bein' Green"" by Andrew Bird, ""Our World"" by My Morning Jacket, and Sondre Lerche's fun ""Mr. Bassman"".

OK Go perform the ""Muppet Show Theme"" in their off-kilter style.  Weezer and Paramore's Hayley Williams put an alternative/punk spin on the uplifting ""Rainbow Connection"".  ""Mahna Mahna"" is pretty much a straight cover of the Muppet original, with very little interpretation by The Fray.

The more I listen to this album, the more I warm up to it.  I love the Muppets and am familiar with most of these songs.  Most of the covers stay true to the original Muppet versions and make for enjoyable listening (though I found ""Night Life"" by Brandon Saller of Atreyu and Billy Martin of Good Charlotte to be too heavy for this collection).  This tribute album hits its highs with the various ballads, in my opinion.  The final three tracks are an excellent block of music to close out the album.

""I Hope That Something Better Comes Along"" was a comical lovesick ditty sung in THE MUPPET MOVIE by Kermit and Rowlf.  Nathanson sings it softly with piano accompaniment.  It's such a beautiful tune, you forget he's singing about dogs and frogs.

I think any Muppet enthusiast should give this tribute album a try.  At least listen to the MP3 samples.  There are some fan-favorite songs and some interesting interpretations.

Whoever was enlisted for production provided some really tired samples that were sloppily chopped up.

Even Dom's darts are terribly boring as are those from the lesser known Wu-affiliates (like Crunch Lo from Cappadonn'a group Othorized F.A.M.), which is one reason why so much of the extended Wu fam is unknown: most of them aren't worth listening to. I hope this 'Security' project is not a downward spiral into the descent of wackness for Dom. Only time will tell.

Every fiber of my being tells me that I should really hate this release...I rarely listen to others so why should I pay much attention to myself. I would be wrong.

Pushing musical boundaries all while innovative, evocative and with an incredible sonic depth of field. The debut from Pear opens the musical senses but asks you to do but one thing.

Listen.

The amount of time, thought and creative energy put into this release must be mind boggling. A musical frame of reference would be later more experimental Miles Davis meets Brian Eno. Welcome to the land of rhythm and groove.

Improvisation. Being in the musical moment is the celebration that is ""Extempore."" One special guest that gives a phenomenal performance is bassist Jennifer Leitham. This is truly a release that will give up something new of itself with each spin of the disc. ""Subtle nuances"" prevail whether the Miles Davis sampled spoken word intro to ""Dewey Miles"" or the rapper Cindy Wonderful this may be the finest example of a free jazz recording session to date.

7339,"I may be over a year late with this review, but I believe someone needs to share just how excellent this album is--especially for psych-rock aficionados--so better late than never. While Tim Cohen's other band, The Fresh & Onlys, are a little more well-known, I believe his work under the name Magic Trick is more timeless. Whereas the former specialize in up-tempo, 60s-ish (now 80s-ish) jangle psych, and to great effect, Magic Trick's music here is truly original, and almost defies categorization.

'The Glad Birth of Love' contains elements of folk, old-school blues, Indian music, Syd Barrett-style psych, and prog, resulting in a sound that not only is unique, but when combined with the surrealistic, soul-stirring lyrics and heartfelt vocals, is very moving as well, and makes for an extremely absorbing listening experience. The four songs here average over 10 minutes apiece, making this album perfect for late-night headphone journeys. Throughout, you'll hear reverb-soaked acoustic finger-picking, gorgeous boy-girl harmonies, hypnotic drones, and stellar dream-like melodies, with a hazy atmospheric sheen over everything that gives these songs an eerie, mystical sound that seems way off in the distance while tickling your brain at the same time.

If you're a fan of The Fresh & Onlys, do yourself a favor and give this a shot, even though it is entirely different. But there's no denying just-plain great-songwriting. The closest comparison I could make would be the rootsy post-rock of early 2000's Califone mixed with the dreamy folk-pop of Skygreen Leopards, but weirder and more progressive. It'd probably be easiest, though, to just check out the free stream at Bandcamp and decide for yourself. If you're anything like me, it most likely won't be coming out of your rotation for a very long time.",1,0.0

1. Maybe = This is a beautiful song. Its a love song for this generation about a guy who likes this girl and he isn't sure if she feels the same and he sits around waiting for her to text him/sign on etc. Its reaaally sweet, the music is beautiful, the words aren't typical what you hear in love songs and jay sean sounds the best hes ever sounded. Its got a little guitar solo that everyone will love towards the end

2. Stay = The lyrics in this song and the chorus are fantastic. I love how he drags on the word ""stay"" in the chorus. Its about a guy and his girl who always argue and basically he says he knows he treats her bad but he wants her to stay. The remix of this is hot as well.

3. Tonight = This song kinda reminds me of Neyo ""Closer"" but its also its own thing. Jay sings about a girl who catches his eye at the club and hes saying he aint lettin her go home tonight.. its a hot track

4. Ride it = I didn't like this song at first but it grows on you.. listen to it a few times its a pretty nice song.

Thats all ive heard but i think it would be worth getting the album. Jay sean has talent we've seen that from his last album. Check out the songs ive listed, im sure you'll love it.

Although Allen is more widely known for his As a Man Thinketh, it is the lesser known The Way of Peace (1907) which reflects more accurately his New Thought Movement affiliations, referencing as it does Christianity, Buddhism and Hinduism. The book is essentially a treatise on the importance of meditation as a 'pathway to divinity'. Whatever we meditate upon, Allen explains, we become. If you meditate upon ' that which is selfish and debasing, you will ultimately become selfish and debased'. Whereas if you meditate upon ' that which is pure and unselfish you will surely become pure and unselfish'. It is now in the public domain within the United States and most other countries. It has been released as a Project Gutenberg eText edition. The book consists of 7 chapters: The Power Of Meditation; The Two Masters, Self And Truth; The Acquirement of Spiritual Power; The Realisation of Selfless Love; Entering into the Infinite; Saints, Sages, And Saviors, The Law Of Service; and The Realisation of Perfect Peace.

Yes, this is a kids song, but for 99 - it's a worthwhile addition to your collection.

On this 2009 album, on which he performs lesser-known standards to the accompaniment of a superb jazz trio (along with tenor sax, fluegelhorn, and cello soloists), Atila has matured into a first-rate song stylist, influenced primarily by the late Mel Torme, with whom he shares a velvety voice and impeccable musicality.  For me, the CD's dual apices are two classics associated with Frank Sinatra which deserve far greater recognition:  ""You, My Love"" and ""Nancy (With the Laughing Face)"", both composed by Sinatra's lifelong pal Jimmy Van Heusen (Mack Gordon supplied the lyrics for ""You, My Love"", while comic Phil Silvers, who was an early Sinatra sidekick, penned the words to ""Nancy"", which was dedicated ""The Voice's"" then-baby daughter) and interpreted most sensitively by Atila.  He rounds out the recording with selections from Richard Rodgers (in collaborations with both Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II, whose lyrics adorn the title track), George and Ira Gershwin, Italy's Riz Ortolani, Johnny Mandel, and Brazil's Dori Caymmi, applying his vocal gloss across the board.

7437,"This song is very unique, and everyone may not like this type of song...I don't know. I do; especially given that fact that Thousand Foot Krutch made and sings it.

It is about drug addicts, I do believe. The singer is saying that ""every time I hear you say I just need one, to take this pain away/
you're a broken wing, not a broken thing, you can heal in time, if you try, it'll be okay, you can walk away, sweet Juliana..."" and that he wishes he can take the pain away, to make it all seem safe.

In the bridge, he says: ""and I won't laugh, I won't look, I won't listen if you just get up/ and I won't laugh, I won't
look, I won't listen if you just stand..."" and I like that, because that is exactly what people who need to stop something (from a bad habit to drugs or whatever) need to hear, that somebody cares and won't laugh at them trying, won't laugh if they fail again.

Which can be used as either God saying that, or a loved one, either works, I think. Or if the person listening to the song has no one, then it's the singer telling them.

For outstanding performances, look for Fritz Reiner's 1960 recording of the excerpts with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Antal Dorati's recording with the Concertgebouworkest, and Gergiev's recording with the Kirov Orchestra (now the Mariinsky Theater Symphony Orchestra). But keep in mind that Reiner's reading is approached as symphonic concert, so expect quick an quirky tempos. On the other hand, Dorati's reading is a lot more sterile and steady. All in all, Reiner and Dorati's readings are performed with such precision it makes Tilson Thomas's recording sound like a High School Band. It's a pity, because Tilson Thomas has some magnificent recordings out there (Beethoven's Late Choral Works with the London Symphony Orchestra), but this just isn't one of them.

If you're looking for a more recent recording, I strongly suggest Sir Simon Rattle's recording with the Berlin Philharmonic. All in all, avoid Tilson Thomas's recording, there's just way more and better competition out there by better orchestras.",0,0.0

7451,"This is a great album. It is unlike anything else you're likely to hear, in a good way. Upbeat, light-hearted and free, it is 60's-style swinging rock with high, distinct vocals. And the song titles are hilarious. These songs combine western rock with what I assume is traditional Cambodian sounds, and they do it beautifully. It is so sad that this entire generation of talented musicians was murdered during the Khmer Rouge.

Listening to this album makes me wonder what Cambodia was like before the Khmer Rouge; it's sort of a glimpse into a lost culture. But beyond all that, it's good music and we're lucky that it survived. Thanks for all the effort that went into making it available online.",1,1.0

7455,"""Your Last Smile"" is the debut album from Iranian composer/pianist Behdad Bahrami, and what an incredible debut it is! The twelve original piano solos are tinged with melancholy and blend classical, new age, and pop elements into a soulful, meaningful listening experience that gives a glimpse into the soul of a very passionate and poetic young man. It is also a reminder of what a powerful and universal language music is and that although we might not understand each other's words, speaking from the heart with music will always be understood.

""Your Last Smile"" begins with ""The Light On the Balcony,"" a piece that conveys warm contentment with an easy grace and gentle touch. ""Secret Whispers"" is gorgeous. A bit more classical in style, the haunting and slowly flowing melody creates a pensive, dreamy mood. ""Voice of the Rain"" is one of my favorites. It occurs to me that if Chopin were alive today, he might compose something like this. I also really love ""Cold Steps,"" a dark, very introspective piece that comes from deep within, expressing a profound sadness that takes your breath away. ""Melody of Autumn"" is much lighter and has a  swirling energy. ""Nobody Knows"" is a lovely ballad that seems to be telling a story - perhaps a shared secret. ""The Last Smile of You"" conveys the feeling of tragic loss. Mournfully sad yet elegant and graceful, this is another favorite. ""The Cafe at 25 O'Clock"" is quite different from the other tracks, with jazz chords and playful keyboard runs that show another side of this gifted artist. ""End of a Dream"" ends the album with a light-hearted waltz that dances around the piano with its charming melody and then ends abruptly at just the right moment.

Behdad Bahrami is a really impressive new artist who just might be on the brink of an international music career. Highly recommended!",1,1.0
7456,"My sole regret is not being present at Washington's Blues Alley when they laid (lain?) these tracks down on a cold January night in 2010.  What an absolute delight of swinging, inventive and nourishing big-band music this is!

While each cut is of interest, I'll single out ""Not on the Bus"", written by MSG Matt Niess, a tour-de-force mini-suite that name-checks both Nat and Miles and generates palpable suspense and excitement with some transitioning flat-5ths before settling down in a nice modal groove.  Excellent!

Then there's ""Barbara"", Horace Silver's waltz by way of ""My Favorite Things"".  Arranger MSG Jim Roberts, the band's guitarist, betrays an impressive harmonic palette as he investigates the full measure of the tune.  This guy can write!  Sopranoist SSG Antonio Orta, takes a nice, evocative solo along the way.

Too many other treasures here to mention. My gosh, the attending audience must have had a wonderful evening of music that night!

In 1999 Primakov won second prize at the Cleveland International Piano Competition, and in 2001 he was a semi-finalist in the Van Cliburn Competition. Upon hearing Primakov's performance of ""La Valse"" at the competition, Van Cliburn himself said ""Prodigious technique, really wonderful,"" with a ""look of sheer rapture on his face."" Primakov then won both the Silver Medal and Audience Prize at the 2002 Gina Bachauer International Piano Competition. In 2007 he was honored by the Classical Recording Foundation with their Young Artist of the Year Award. His disc of 21 Mazurkas by Chopin was named a ""Best of Year"" by National Public Radio (2009).

7475,"Singer-songwriter Polache got his start with a rousing anthem urging Hondurans to take pride in their nation, Polache is the stage name of 32-year-old Paul Hughes. The moniker combines his first name with the Spanish pronunciation of the initial letter of his last name.

Born to an English father and a Honduran mother, Polache began playing guitar when he was 9. But he didn't think he could make a living as a musician so, after university, he took a job with an ad agency in the northern city of San Pedro Sula, Corts.

There, Polache was chosen to compose the music for an ad campaign promoting Honduras and the result, ""Mira a Honduras"" or ""Look at Honduras,"" became a surprise hit. In the song, Polache points out that besides political corruption, gang wars and poverty, Honduras is home to great natural beauty and honest, hardworking people.

""This is a country with low self-esteem,"" Polache said. ""I wanted to write a song that said: Even if we have thousands of problems, we have many good things that need to be recognized.""

The success of ""Mira a Honduras"" led to a television program in which Polache traveled the backroads, strumming his guitar and singing with the locals -- like an old-fashioned troubadour.

[...]

Polache grew up listening to U.S. and British pop music. But he later came to believe that too many Honduran tastes -- from fast food to popular music -- were imported. ""My music tries to promote all that's catracho,"" he said, using a slang term for Honduran.

For many years he chased that dream playing with one of the nation's biggest teams : Motagua. Failing to obtain success he called it a day and decided to start a career in the advertisement industry. He created numerous jingles for commercial products. His breakthrough as an artist came while working on a Honduran Tourism campaign, which needed a song to go along with the advertisement. Polache submitted ""Mira a Honduras"". The song was selected.  At first his name was not mentioned, but people got interested and started asking questions about the unidentified artist. From then on his career flourished.  Polache went on to have his own tv show ""De Troba con Polache"", in which he visited various places in Honduras.

At some point Polache got financial help from an artist support program created by the couped president Manuel Zelaya. When the coup happened in June 2009, Polache was one of the few Honduran artists to strongly oppose. He called himself apolitical but said he was a friend of president Zelaya.

Polache's music has been a great success thanks to the things he sings about : from everyday social problems to one of Honduras' main passions : football. He tends to write his songs in a very special way, using as much Honduran words and expressions as possible.",1,1.0

On a side note:  This review is for this one song.  It bears no reflection on the artist's past body of work.  If David Gilmour had a FSotD and I didn't like it I would give it a low rating.  That low rating would have zero indication on how much I love a good bit of Pink Floyd.",0,0.0

Sauusplaneetta is the only album that Sauruxet ever released. The band apparently worked things out with their record company and returned to their old lineup and name.

The music is fairly similar to Hevisaurus, light-hearted Power Metal and Classic Metal sung in Finnish. The production is excellent and the musicianship (as expected) is also very good. Riffi Raffi has some excellent shredding leads and riffs throughout the cd. The songs actually sound more serious and more standard Metal than the Hevisaurus stuff that I have heard (which is goofier). Then again, I don't speak Finnish so I don't know how silly the lyrics are, they sound more serious than Hevisaurus though, lol!

7564,"Harry Flowers - Wyvern & Worm (Nouveau Tattva)
Harry Flowers is an Australian musician / singer-songwriter, who moved to Texas in 2004, recorded a series of hard-to-find EPs, before settling right here in Leicester. Harry Flowers, of course, was a character in the notorious 1968 Nicolas Roeg film, Performance, a strange, cruel little movie that's credited for signaling the end of the `60s alongside Altamont, the Manson Family murders, the demise of The Beatles and the inexplicable triumph of The Archies' ""Sugar Sugar"". Rum times indeed.

The irony is that ""Wyvern & Worm"" is doing its best to preserve many of the sounds of `60s, it's gentle psychedelic jangle will remind many of groups such as The Zombies and Traffic, right through to the more traditionalist recordings of XTC and Robyn Hitchcock. Fortunately, Flowers songs are ageless, impossible to truly pin down, and rather than wallow in clich, he writes songs that timelessly evoke an England, which hasn't altogether disappeared, but is certainly becoming harder to find. He then envelops them in soaring harmony and perfect pop arrangements.

""Wyvern & Worm"" won't bring Flowers international stardom and untold wealth, but it does mark the arrival of an artist eager to come to terms with new surroundings, new traditions and enduring music. The best material here happily stands alongside the classic recordings that have obviously influenced him. ""Pastoral Fantastic"" takes on early, baggy Blur and wins with a paisley flourish. ""Sad Light"" brings his antipodean roots to bear, and the Finn brothers are filtered through hazy sunshine psychedelia. ""Dawn Chorus"" greets the new day with Northern brass and a cheery disposition, and best of all, ""White Horse"", six minutes of mellow, intense narrative, accompanied by graceful strum and the impression of old Albion restored.",1,1.0

7566,"It goes without saying that Fanny were the premier female rock group of their time and I'd argue that their concise instrumental prowess and fresh intelligent songwriting put them a notch ahead of the average group of either gender. Why their rich musical legacy has been criminally unrecognised is incomprehensible to me but that might change if June and Jean Millington's 'Play like a Girl' gets heard as it harks back to Fanny at their best and shows where they are right now.

The title track is guarenteed to get the dead rise out of their graves and dance as it is played at an infectious energy level and is June Millington's opening feminist exhortation that you can do what you damn well want. I love Your Hair sharply references back to a previous era as a sixties woman in both senses of the term with lightning fast sharp observations. Jean's fine vocals and funk bass playing comes to the fore in let Love Linger with acid guitar lines. The softer side of the Millington sisters show up in  June's tender love song ""When You Bottom"" and the melodic ""Calling Your Name (To The Stars) I must pay tribute to Jean's son, Lee Madeloni as his fine drumming and percussion lends an incisive edge to the ensemble sound that is always there when needed. Jean's bass playing and singing makes a rock solid support as she always has done. The very worthy women musicians of the Institute of the Musical Arts get an airing in this project in ""One for Change,"" a great stomping rocker with gritty harmonisied chorus vocals and the contrasting modern R and B lead vocal stylings of Endless Lies, a syncopated rocker with lyrics that go way beyond what might appear an exhortation to a faithless lover to straighten up. June's prowess as electric slide guitar from way back of Terrible Things reaches further into the awesome 'Train's a coming' Son House country blues of 'Fall on You' with contrasting light dancing vocals.

This is the album where youthful enthusiasm and age and experience hold hands and this feels so like a review of Fanny's ""Fanny Hill"" album it is unbelievable and I urge those best able to see them in concert.",1,1.0
7567,"To say that June and Jean Millington are a vital, albeit grossly overlooked, part of rock & roll history is a major understatement. As the co-founders of Fanny, the pioneering (and still, to this day, best!) all-female band, they, along with Suzi Quatro, set the stage for every other female rocker to come along over the next four decades.
 Over the years the duo have continued to work together, be it on June's three solo albums, as a duo (1978's LADIES ON THE STAGE and TICKET TO WONDERFUL from 1993) and with a new band, the Slammin' Babes (2000's MELTING POT).
 Now, more than a decade after the rather hit-and-miss MELTING POT, the sisters Millington return with PLAY LIKE A GIRL, arguably their best album since MOTHERS PRIDE, June's 1973 swan song with Fanny. While the disc isn't perfect (the production is a tad thin in spots, Jean Milington is woefully underused, students at June's Institute for the Musical Arts are used too much), it's pretty darn close. THIS is the album that many Fanny-atics have been waiting for!
 (On a side note, it's so cool to see so many women in their 60's still rockin' hard. Besides the Millington's, Quatro, Stevie Nicks and Deborah Harry ~ with Blondie~ have all released incredably strong albums this year, certainly among some of 2011's best).
 PLAY LIKE A GIRL kicks off with it's blistering title track. Full of garage-band energy and youthful swagger, this auto biographical tale is like ""Charity Ball"" all grown up! The sisters still have those killer harmonies that only siblings seem to be blessed with, while the instrumentation is taut and lively.
 In a just world, this would be a huge radio hit, but there are a couple of things that will prevent that from happening. First, there are the lyrics...songs about fishes surfing up stream just aren't in demand. Then there's the production ~ there are holes here that you could drive a semi through. By going for more of a live feel, June Millington and co-producer Lee Madeloni (Jean's exceptionally talented son) have kept things pretty bare-boned. By adding some keyboards, a little more percussion and some additional backing vocals, the track would have been much more fleshed out, resulting in a great cut vs. just a very good one. Still, one of my favorite tracks off the disc!
 Ditto ""I Love Your Hair!"" June Millington has rarely sung with such authority, attitude or animalistic passion. Growling the lyrics, she lets us know that she's been here since ""before the Gap/before Madonna/before rap"", and in that time, she's picked up a thing or two, resulting in a person she's happy with, both inside and out. Mark my word, this one IS ready to be a hit at urban, pop and A/C radio. Brilliant! (Special mention has to be made of Jean's amazing bass riffs...they anchor the song perfectly!).
 ""Let Love Linger"" has both it's pros and cons. On the up side, it features Jean's only (co) lead vocal. Still supple and sultry, her voice dances over the first verse's lyrics, caressing them in a velvety embrace. Why this woman doesn't take more leads ~ or do a solo album, for God's sake! ~ is beyond me!
 On the down side, the song just goes on waaaay too long. Since moving beyond Fanny, the Millington's have frequently had a tendency to get a bit 'jammy', resulting in tracks that could have ~ and should have! ~ been edited down. This is one such track. Still,very nice.
 ""When You Bottom"" is sheer pop perfection. With it's lilting arrangement, spirited lead vocal courtesy of June and the girl group backing vocals, this track is plain old fun, from start to finish.
 ""Apocalypse Deferred"" has a dark, prophetic quality to it that really works....I just wish that they had taken it further. The arrangement is urgent and edgy, while June's lead vocal is honest and knowing, but the young girl chorus just seems calculated and contrived. I would have much rather seen something chilly, strong and steely from Jean, along the lines of her bridge on ""Woman Who Sees The Signs"" from June's excellent 1983 solo album RUNNING.
 Throughout her career, June Millington has written some amazing ballads, including ""You've Got A Home"" from Fanny's 1972 masterpiece FANNY HILL and LADIES ON THE STAGE's ""Fantasy."" We can now add ""Calling Your Name (To The Stars)"" to that list. With it's atmospheric arrangement, delicate instrumentation and lovely lead vocal, this song is simply stunning. Nothing more need be said.
 ""Terrible Things"" has a wonderful bluesy vibe to it. Both tense AND relaxed, taut AND loose, June's guitar just talks to us here, even moreso than her lyrics. Yet another gem.
 ""Fall On You"" is a solid album cut, with a minimal, yet strong, arangement (once again, June's guitar just shines!) and a wise, soulful lead vocal.
 ""All For One"" is sweet enough, but we've heard June do a variant of this song on pretty much every album since '78. Nice....but necessary? I'm not sure.
 ""One For Change"" could have been a great rocker, but it's ultimately sunk by a number of miscalculations. First off, we once again have the production...this sounds like a demo tape. Second, the chorus...really amateurish and sloppy. Finally, the track just goes on WAY too long, repeating itself over and over. Yep, the seeds were there....they just never took root.
 And then there's ""Endless Lies'...I have a real issue with this cut. I'm all for June's work with IMA, but there's a time and a place for it, and it's not here. . I'm paying for a June and Jean Millington album, not a class project for Summer camp 2010. I WANT June and Jean Millington, especially when Jean Millington is already almost nowhere to be found (If we're being really honest here, why even call this a June and Jean Millington album? To cash in even more on the Fanny connection? Let's face it...this is basically a June Millington solo album). On top of all that, the lyrics are just dreadful...straight out of Intro to Poetry 101, or, even worse, some tweener's journal. A MAJOR misstep.
 Wrapping things up is the funky ""Opportunity Knocks."" I wish June had taken the time to build on this gem with another verse or a bridge ~ this is another good song that could have been fantastic.
 In summing things up, I just want to say how much I love both June and Jean Millington (and have for 40 years now!) and PLAY LIKE A GIRL, warts and all. Both the sisters and this album are vitally important to music, and I, for one, can't wait to see what comes next! I just hope A) it doesn't take another ten years, and B) Jean can be convinced to pick up a pen and step up to the mike a bit more! Until then...play on, ladies....play on! (As with all my reviews, I'm docking the disc half a star for not including the lyrics).",1,1.0

Not good, not good, not good!!!!!!!!!!!

Rap is so awful in the first place, but to subject children to it through learning is atrocious! Our minds are altered by the frequencies of music & television, whether positively or negatively. This just made my shoulders meet my ears & cringe. I shut it off immediately. I would never purchase anything like this.

Let children be children & let them listen to REAL children's music, not noise pollution passed off under the pretense of being educational. I'm only 30, so my children are younger. I like musicians like Tom Chapin. His album ""Some Assembly Required"" is good.
Stop trying to make them grow up too fast by listening to imitations of the filth that adults listen to. When you have children that grow up listening to garbage music & television (ie: Nicki Minaj, ""Family Guy"" & the like), it programs their brains (television PROGRAMS) & creates chaos & confusion.
I don't think adults should listen to or watch that raunchy filth in the first place, but hey... the entertainment business banks on feeble minded people who wish to mindlessly numb themselves rather than enrich their lives.
 THEN people wonder why their child is a heathen, does poorly in school due to anger & frustration (frequencies), dresses like a thug or a street walker & won't listen to them. Temper tantrums are just uncontrolled & unguided bouts of anger. Most people anymore don't care to correct (PARENT), but temporarily mask it with a ""reward"", like junk food, electronics or letting them run wild because they don't want to deal with them. I call it Wal-Mart Kid Syndrome. That child then grows up to be a hedonistic, uneducated jerk of an adult with an undeserving air of entitlement & narcissism because it was never corrected.

7581,"Not too long since the release of Fantasynth and it's slightly more upbeat rhythms and fantasy themes, we're now treated with this work which delves into the more mysterious and legends based on celtic mythology, a theme very prevalent in gothic ethereal realms. It seems we're able to pick up where we left off with Mythomusic or The Garden with the dreamy mystical sounds on this album. The delicate layers of ambient music are presented across well over an hour in this fantasy world and eleven tracks for a nice full body of work.

The album starts off with a rich and dreamy mixture of ambient textures in ""Forest Heartbeat"" and also with the follow-up piece ""True Spirit of Nature"" for over fourteen minutes of beautiful, lush dreamscapes. At this point we're launched into a little more up-beat chill-out style with ""Samhain Ecstasy"" and even more of a harsher tone with some grinding guitars (still in a new age style) on ""Sancta Inquisitio"". This uptempo rhythm carries on somewhat further into ""Druids Trance"", appropriately named for it's trance-like rhythms and electronic loops. At this point we get to a definite favorite of mine in ""My Beloved Loneliness"", with a little more of a classical style with more organic sounding instruments taking the forefront over the interwoven tapestries of the melancholy backdrop. ""Ritual of Love"" follows in similar light with a little bit more of a ritual sound as the name implies with some percussion and various hypnotic rhythms and loops. ""Earth Prayer"" is another excellent ambient ethereal piece with angelic vocals gliding over the entrancing music as we drift along into the upbeat trance-like piece ""Beltane Moon"". The soaring synths and moving, but very New Age rhythms and beats move us into another sweet, dreamy track ""Bewitched by the Faeries"". This eight minute track drifts along slowly and hypnotically, setting the stage for eight-minute finale ""Wisdom of Trees"". Ambient, whispering tendrils gently carress the listener in this soft, dreamy piece with it's subtle, layered soundscapes providing a backdrop for a siren song, luring the listener in and holding them entranced and trapped for the duration as the album slowly and softly drifts to a close.

Over all the album is firmly rooted in the New Age style, something I've mentioned before we don't normally feature and review here on Gothic Paradise. However, there is just enough of the lush, ethereal and darker, dreamier ambient styles that take the listener into a beautiful dream-like fantasyland that has always caught my attention. As you listen to our ethereal radio show and a Psicodreamics track comes on, it just fits well within the hauntingly beautiful ambient realm, even with the touch of chill-out New Age styles. This album fits right in that mold as we drift from one piece to another, through the ebbing and flowing of the lush layers from smooth ambient synths to a little more pronounced styles and more upbeat rhythms. For fans of the softer ethereal and ambient soundscapes, this album is a great addition to any collection.

7614,"AKB48 is back with their 23rd CD single ""Kaze wa Fuiteiru"" (which translates to ""The Wind is Blowing"") and features an upbeat, touching song with lyrics to help those who suffered from the 2011 Tohoku tsunami and earthquake disaster.

Not long after the earthquake, several members of AKB48 had visited areas of devastation and as always, their goal to put a smile on everyone's faces, the group performed for families who were displaced and living in temporary shelters.

After their first tour, by the second visit to perform in front of families, a new song titled ""Kaze wa Futeiru"" had been created to help ease the pain of those who have suffered so much.  And also donating proceeds to the relief process.

Like other recent AKB48 CD singles, ""Kaze wa Fuiteiru"" has been released in 5 versions.  A regular and limited Type A, Type B editions (limited editions come with an event ticket) and the theater edition (which includes the first two tracks that come with the other two TYPE's, ""Kaze wa Fuiteiru"" and ""Kimi no Senaka"" but comes with second C/w song by Team 4 and KISS titled ""Tsubomitachi"" and no DVD).  Also, Type A and Type B will have different c/w songs.

And once again, in a time where CD sales are lower than ever in Japan, ""Kaze wa Fuiteiru"" became the fifth million selling CD single for the group and going to show that AKB48s popularity is the real deal!

The version I will be reviewing is the regular edition Type-B featuring Mayu Watanabe, Yuki Kashiwagi and Minama Takahashi on the cover and the songs featured in the Type-B edition are ""Kaze wa Futeiru"", ""Kimi no Senaka"", ""Gondola Lift"".  The limited edition Type B comes with a random photo (there are a total of 18 available) and comes with a serial number to access a site for voting a song to be performed at AKB48s Request Hour Setlist Best 100 2012 concert and a promotional for their 2012 box calendar.

As for the CD single, ""Kaze wa Futeiru"" is a positive song of how people in despair, should have hope, should search for the light. Also, a song about rebuilding for the future and for one to continue living. How love and hope will continue and that the wind will continue to blow into the future.

My first time listening to the song and I was instantly hooked.  The melody was captivating and I loved the harmony among the various members performing the song.  But the positive message of hope is what I enjoyed most about this song.

The second song ""Kimi no Senaka"" (which translates to ""Back to you"") is performed by the Undergirls (these are the members of the group who were ranked #22-#30 in the AKB48 senbatsu elections, who get to perform the c/w song).  The song is upbeat and continues the AKB48 happy, upbeat idol style.  While the song is catchy and a fun song to listen to, the lyrics are actually quite sad as it revolves around loving someone but that person not noticing you.  And one yearning to be noticed.

The third track is ""Gondola Lift"" and is performed by Undergirls Yurigumi.  For this single, the Undergirls was split into three groups with Baragumi performing ""Vamos"", while Yurigumi performed ""Gondola Lift"".  The slow ballad is about being a couple, in love and being together with hearts as one and growing old together and also dying together.  A touching song!

The three tracks that round out the single are the off-vocal versions of each song, which are pretty much the music no vocal tracks.

As for the DVD, the DVD comes with a total of five tracks.

The first music video is for ""Kaze wa Fuiteiru"" as AKB48 tries to revive this tree-like being by freeing it from its captivity.  Also, a dance portion featuring the group dancing.  In terms of the music video, for set design, this is probably an interesting video as it has this tribalistic style to it, with the tree-being almost reminding me a of Studio Ghibli character.  As for costume design, the costumes are quite subdued compared to other AKB48 costume design but I liked the choreography on a dirt like setting and seeing the dirt flow while the group is dancing.  Overall, a good video.

The second music video is for ""Kimi no Senaka"" and has more dialogue and features friends who get into a discussion about a guy they like, while another friend is moving away.  Like the lyrics to the song itself, it's happy and upbeat but also a hint of sadness as well.

The third music video is for ""Gondola Lift"" and this video is actually my favorite video on the entire DVD.  Not only is the song beautiful and touching, the music video shows what is behind the windows of an apartment building and we see an elderly man taking care of his sick wife, a family eating dinner and a young couple with a young woman who wants to marry her boyfriend.

The fourth music video is the ""DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! version of ""Kaze wa Fuiteiru"", so no mystical creature is featured.  It's all dancing!

And the final fifth music video is the ""Tokuten eizo AKB48 conte Taxi-hen"" featuring a comedy skit with Mariko Shinoda as a taxi driver and Yuki Kashiwagi as a passenger.  The skit revolves around a taxi driver who talks too much.

Overall, ""Kaze wa Fuiteiru"" is a wonderful and enjoyable CD single from AKB48.  While there are the different versions available for fans who may prefer certain singles showcasing their favorite performer, I personally chose this CD+DVD single because of its inspirational songs.  ""Kaze wa Fuiteiru"" is an inspirational song but ""Gondola Lift"" was a fantastic and touching Undergirls track with a music video that was just equally enjoyable.

But all tracks on this CD single showcase a nice balance of music from AKB48 as well as its DVD.

Once again, I'm pretty impressed with what Yasushi Akimoto has done with AKB48 and how hard these young ladies have come since 2005.  This is another addictive CD single and if you are an AKB48 fan, ""Kaze wa Fuiteiru (Type-B)"" is highly recommended!",1,0.0

7622,"The Chicago Kingsnakes - Blue Mosaic (MusicKing Records)
Their first proper album since 2003's ""Grass Roots"", though they've busied themselves over the intervening years touring the world with Byther Smith and playing shows with Junior Wells, Jimmy Witherspoon, Cash McCall, etc. When added to the fact that Kingsnakes leader, guitarist-vocalist James Anderson, has played with everyone from Buddy Guy and Albert King to Son Seals, James Cotton and Koko Taylor, It's probably safe to assume that The Chicago Kingsnakes are some of the best and most respected blues players around.

That's certainly the impression I get from listening to ""Blue Mosaic"". Their style, unsurprisingly, is Chicago blues, and they play it slow and heavy, and tight and upbeat, and whatever way they play it, they play it well. Opening number ""Take Your Time"" is measured and intense, and highlights all their strengths, primarily great musicianship. When they're aiming to get feet moving on tracks like ""Blues Gone Uptown"" and the Sonny Boy Williamson(esque) ""Lefty"" - the latter with harmonica courtesy of Nelson Keaton - they sound like the ultimate blues bar band. It's another track, ""So Cold in Chicago"", that I find myself returning to. Another upbeat number, it's what they used to call a toe-tapper, but it's a bit more than that, and seems to be stuck on repeat.",1,0.0

I arrived back on my base and ordered Better Days [the album]. I fell in love with the voice, the lyrics, the melodies. Some of the tracks are slow, and full of ""God's Breathe"". My favorites are Better Days (I play it every morning while getting ready for work), Faith of Our Fathers, Eternal God, and my all time favorite ""Jesus, Garden of My Rest"". I have to say that Jesus, Garden of My Rest literally brought me down to my knees crying and praising our Lord. The songs have touched me like no other song has. Michael W. Smith comes pretty close however.
I am eagerly looking for more RSB albums, and will snatch them up as soon as they hit.

Thank you, Robbie, for helping me fall even deeper in love with Christ.

7675,"I hear wind chimes ... feel a cool breeze ... observe a vivid desert sunset ... experience a glorious sunrise ... see reflections on a glimmering lake's surface. The delicate and expressive ""chamber jazz"" of Pat Battstone (piano) and Richard Poole (vibraphone) will have you conjuring up many images of your own. As the two experienced musicians from Boston genially converse in an improvisational style, there are many musical moods created. Their second album release in less than a year, Battstone and Poole now feel that they have solidified their musical direction with additional maturity and an element of playfulness. They state, ""Mystery and suspense, call and response, have become more refined and our musical Voice has emerged."" I find their articulate expressions to be quite dreamlike and perfect for easy-listening or meditative contemplation.

Both jazz musicians display an affinity for the avant-garde, and they're carving personalized identities as an amalgamation of their personal influences. For pianist Pat Battstone, we hear a personality that seems to incorporate styles of Marilyn Crispell, Keith Jarrett, Bobo Stenson, Charlie Banacos and Bill Evans. As far as vibraphonists go, I hear elements of Teddy Charles and Gary Burton (whose ""Dreams So Real"" album might have been inspirational). Originally from Ohio, Battstone attended the Berklee College of Music in 1973. He's done a great deal of solo and ensemble work, as well as teaching, producing and recording. Battstone doesn't just play the piano's keys. He may pluck the strings to produce overtones, or he may employ hammers directly to the strings. At present, he also works as a rocket scientist at Draper Labs in Cambridge, Ma.

Richard Poole also has a long resume with many years as a professional musician.  He holds a Bachelor's Degree in Music Composition from Florida International University. Performance, production, a piano business and teaching have been his main focus over the years. He's helped many develop their own voice in music. Now, the two of them together are continuing to cultivate their own musical manifestations. Their kaleidoscope of magical sound is best described as an otherworldly soundscape of sensitive splendor, beautiful colors, and delicate textures.  (Joe Ross, Roots Music Report)",1,1.0

7789,"Yes, this band is almost so bad that you can't help but like them. I first discovered seventh Avenue back in the mid-1990s. I was really into bands like Helloween, Blind Guardian and the like; this band, was said to be very much like the other melodic, German metal acts that were popular in those days. Needless to say, I was curious and the artwork on the album covers seemed to call out for me to buy all of the available albums by Seventh Avenue in one fell swoop. The outcome of that purchase, Seventh Avenue does have a hint of Helloween and the like in their music, but there is one major difference here; and that is that Seventh Avenue's music can be so speedy, that it almost spirals out of control. Don't get me wrong, they have some good songs and you can hear that they're actually pretty good musicians on some of their compositions. It just seems that the guy who wrote all of the songs, is so concerned with being fast, Zippy full speed ahead metal that the songs can become almost incoherent. The guitars are so fast in some of the songs, that the lyrics sounds like they were squeezed in there with a shoehorn and bellowed out with no thought to where the melody was going. Hence, some of the songs by Seventh Avenue sound very amateurish and thrown together. Honestly, some of their music is as orchestrated as a random car crash. But yet, on some of the songs, their talent shines through and you find yourself actually liking this band despite the mess that may populate the rest of the album. Over the years, I have formed a like/hate relationship with this band. If anyone is interested in picking up onep of their albums, I would suggest they start with South gate, this is the best of their offerings and is the most solid album they ever did. The rest of the albums have moments that shine, but also lots of moments that have one reaching for the Excedrin by the time the song is over.",0,0.0

Look for the other copy of this song under its proper name: the title of this selection is not 'Eddie Was a Lady' but rather 'Eadie Was a Lady'. My support of LGBT rights notwithstanding, the former would must needs be a very different song and I suppose it is debatable whether Merman would have performed it. Nevertheless, Eadie Was a Lady is one of Merman's signature tunes, although the show for which it was written seems rather deservedly forgotten. I would call this version, with a rousing orchestration by Jay Blackton, arranger and conductor of the famous Merman/Martin duet for the Ford Motor Company 50th Anniversary telecast (now available elsewhere on Amazon,) the definitive rendition. Other performances changed the words (there were certain subjects you just couldn't mention on television, and prostitution was one of them) and others suffer from less than ideal sonic properties. This one combines one of Merman's most enthusiastic performances of the song with a very decent pre-hi-fi recording and the splendid Blackton orchestration.",0,0.0
7874,"I have had the good fortune to live with the new Scott Matthews album, What the Night Delivers,  for a little while (courtesy of signing up for an early copy as a result of being at the superb Wolverhampton show a couple of weeks ago) Its official release on San Remo Records isn't due until September when it comes out alongside a raft of shows around the UK. It can however be ordered now through his website for those who, understandably, can't wait until then.

Having heard a few of the songs from the album at earlier shows, and hoping they presaged a set of songs that engendered the excitement of the first album, I didn't want to rush into comment for fear of letting my hopes run away with me. But now I know the whole set a good deal better and, without being a retrograde step,  they are a return to the things that first grabbed me about Scott Matthews.

Gone is what was, in hindsight , the slightly over-blown band sound of Elsewhere and here is a determinedly intimate and up-close album, concentrating on the Mr M's vocals and guitar work, an album of rare delicacy and lightness of touch. After hoping for an album like this, what a triumph, what a relief!

Although the band takes more of a back seat, there are none the less some most excellent supporting musicians - Sam Martin on drums and percussion,  Greg Stoddard on lap steel (even more rewarding in a live situation), the fine Danny Keane on cello and Danny Thompson on double bass.

As suggested by the title, What the Night Delivers, is in many respects music made for the dark, the quiet, the solitary long drive on night-time country roads - not an album to get them out and dancing in the aisles, and thank goodness for that.

There are tantalising echoes of the first album Passing Stranger - not just in the atmosphere, but some of the structures, perhaps not quite so overt this time, but still there - the almost-tracks such as at the very start before Myself Again and once more the last minute of Bad Apple leading into So Long, My Moonlight -  musical cameos, perfect in their own way but also creating a little more space and air between songs.

Also in evidence is the Indian influence of before - notably in the beautiful walking Home in the Rain, but fleeting glimpses elsewhere in rhythms and intervals, the tabla on Bad Apple for instance.

To my mind there is not a weak track here, but that doesn't mean that there aren't a few particular stand-out tracks, for me these include Ballerina Lake, Head First into Paradise, Echoes of the Lonely, the aforementioned Walking Home in the Rain.

The album gives off the same vibe that you get from Scott's more intimate and stripped back shows (such as the two Wolverhampton shows at Newhampton Arts  - in 2011  and 2009 ). These are personal and direct, uncluttered by unnecessary effects and additions, and similarly here on this album everything has a place and a purpose. A joy and delight form start to finish, anyone yet to catch him live should make the effort for the dates in the autumn, you cannot fail to be impressed. I hope Mr M doesn't mind but below I have popped my own little vid of The Man Who Had Everything from the Wolverhampton show just recently - apologies for the light level - should he not want it here I will happily remove, but it does give a hint of how the new material comes over live.",1,1.0

The album has a lot of different feels to different songs, but each song winds up repetitive and dull with no worthwhile lyrics to keep the listener engaged.

7943,"After hearing 2 songs from this guy before this album dropped, I figured it would be a decent album with just raw rapping and not much actually being said.

I was wrong.

The album is entirely produced by Tony Mahoney from the UK, and the beats are all very dark and depressing, none of them being traditional hip-hop type beats, the instrumentation ranges from horns to an upright bass even to an accordion on one track. The album is 12 tracks divided into 3, 4 track parts. To simplify the three parts they could be labelled as Sadness, Anger, and Self-Analysis respectively, while through the whole project he struggles in his fight with alcohol. By the end of the first track you realize that this album is going somewhere serious and you're in for a ride, when you get to the third, The Underground, you start to figure out 24's opinion on hip-hop is very atypical. Not to call it right or wrong, but he doesn't want to make ignorant club bangers an street anthems, but he also not concerned with getting the fans away from it. He expresses the intent to make his music the way he likes it because hip-hop isn't worth saving for an ignorant audience. Track 4 comes in, the melody of the beat is a lady singing in Spanish over the harmony of an acoustic guitar. He keeps the song relevant to the album, furthering his status as a loner while flexing his raw rapping skills more than any other track on the album. Ridiculous bars such as ""Take a shot to the head and listen to Cobain."" and ""Thinking you on C's level but you 20,000 leagues under me."" and a double time spat clean enough to make Tech N9ne nervous. Enter part 2, Anger. Cam feels the need to say ""F*** you"" to a lot of people, starting with fans that won't leave him alone on The Neverending Story of The Parasite, asking them

""Wanna go to my school and get my degree for me? Go to my job and work these 40 hours a week for me? Come up with these ideas and think for me? Have battles every night with these drinks for me? You wanna know how it feels to always be drunk at home? How it feels to live life without a comfort zone? No? Alright cool then stop asking me stupid questions and leave me the f*** alone.""

The next target is the record executives pushing young artists into neglecting their skills and churn out simple mega-hit singles, the last target is the government on The Warden, I felt this song was misplaced, it fits the mood of the album but not the themes so much. I briefly discussed the album with 24/7 himself and he said he felt the same way while writing it, but he explained it as he's so angry with the world at this point in the album that he's getting everything off of his chest all at once before he gets into the final act. One thing in particular I liked about The Industry and The Warden was that in the first verses of each he rapped from the perspective of the record executive pushing the rapper to sign the contract and the government official filling our heads with propaganda and assuring us that they know what's best respectively.

Part three is at least as personal as the first, probably more. My Apologies delivers precisely what it promises, he realizes that he is just as flawed as everyone he has spouted off at. Now that he's alone he's trying to make amends for all the isolation he has placed himself in. Battle Cry has the most positive vibe of any song of the album, almost as if he's sobered up and cheered up, starting to realize where he stands in life.

Track twelve comes in. It started with the sound of empty bottles clanging together, and he almost-mumbles the words ""They say alcohol is man's worst enemy, but the bible says to love your enemy. That's word to Frank Sinatra babyyyyy."" The song is almost like a relapse, he displays a mixture of cockiness, and frustration almost as if he's back to where he was in the first two parts. The piano and upright bass keep playing long after the lyrics end, and that's it.

This is 100% honestly one of the best albums I've ever heard. It's genuine, personal, and poetic. At 22 years old, and this being his 1st album, an incredible potential to do something very big for rap is shown.

""I won't be compared to Eminem, Lil Wayne or Hov. More like Fitzgerald, Hemmingway and Poe.""

7947,"I had the great privilege of seeing Josh perform the role of Judas Iscariot in ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" this week.  His performance took my literal breath away, so I went home and purchased his newest music, and was not disappointed.  Only further intrigued!

I am not a music critic, only a fan of music, so forgive me that my review is not technical.  Only  emotional!

Josh's voice pours out like honeyed wine.  Yes, it is sweet, but he can also deliver such sadness and pathos, that adds a tartness, a crispness to songs we have heard before.  The song ""When She Loved Me"" was a great favorite of mine already, and this rendition is so singular, so moving.  I found a new respect for the lyrics, and for how artists intrepret various songs.

I am not ashamed to say my eyes welled up during ""The Rainbow Connection"", a song that lovers and dreamers have adopted for 30 years.  He brings a gorgeous voice to the sentiment, and it's never corny or false, the feeling comes through and touches, even penetrates the listener.

Every song carries Josh's passionate, but angelic stamp.  He is the angelic voice that is burnished by a fiery humanity.  I recommend his music to any and every one who wants to be moved, transcended.

I have wishlist of songs that I would love to see Josh do for his next project, but would be equally happy with whatever he chose to interpret.

Also, you have to buy the entire album to get just the one piece of music (weirder), and the producer of this soundtrack thought it would be cool to sprinkle dialogue from the film throughout (weirdest), which I don't find so cool, personally (this isn't a campy Flash Gordon movie).

Even the Broadway production felt like a community theater endeavor. It's no wonder it is rarely listed among Stephen Schwartz's many accomplishments. A formidable composer, even his bomb, The Bakers Wife has better music. Actually it has a ravishing score, but a book that can't seem to work.

8057,"When romance is in the air, nothing accentuates it quite like the right music, which, when done properly, has the power to magnify powerful emotions and moods. ""Fall In Love,"" by singer/songwriter/producer Ginger Patterson is a ballad that is almost undefinable. Containing both traditional and unconventional elements, it is like a fine, abstract piece of art; everyone who listens to it will hear something different, but it is open to interpretation and there is most definitely something there to appreciate.

The song begins with an interesting guitar, strings, and a piano melody that sets up the entrance of Ginger's sensual voice. Lyrically strong, ""Fall In Love"" tells of the things that are beautiful about being in love.  Ginger has a range of tones within her voice, and is capable of quickly and smoothly transitioning from a soft breathy sound to a full tone, with a touch of gospel conviction in her delivery, and very solid background harmony on her vocal overdubs. More tasteful keyboard sounds appear on the second verse, along with drums, a tambourine, and clever production ideas with regard to breaks in the phrasing, bringing cool surprises. In music, timing is everything. When you do something is just as important as how, and much thought was given not to overuse a sound just for the sake of doing so. The chords are solid and flow well with the way Ginger arranged her vocals, which are gripping in just the right places, pulling the lyrics and music together in a way that will remind listeners of loves past and present. Ginger has a unique voice and vocal style, but it is one that this listener appreciates.",1,0.0

So, after about five or six weeks of using the sessions is when I really began to see results.  Particularly when it came to procrastination, that was the area I first began to notice change...typically, I've been very good at putting things off to the last minute; however, I began to catch myself saying no, do it now.  After four and a half months of doing a hypnosis session pretty much every day I see substantial improvements in all areas of my life.  Confidence is high and getting higher, as I said procrastination is becoming a thing of the past, I'm happier and a much better person to be around.

That's right folks, it was recorded by an audience member with a good seat in the front row. There is a woman who talks almost constantly near-by in a whisper and a man whose annoying coughing is the best sound on the recording. Sometimes he sounds so life-like you want to turn around to see who is standing behind you. It IS October in New York. I love so-called 'live' historic recordings but if there is a limit...this is it.

Even though I was into a rather obscure musical blend, they still managed to pull out a track that I was instantly drawn to. Now, I could have walked away from there, but instead bought this CD from them in person for $20.00 - All the tracks on the disc kept me listening.

At the moment (9/6/15), this CD is not available, but the disc with both Beach Boys Songbooks can be had for $466-!400.00. In other words, essentially unavailable. I've noticed that Amazon is beginning to do this with other out of print CD's, usually 60's catalog, and I can only encourage them to do more of this because there is an audience out there for these titles if they're not $100.

The Hollyridge Strings were actually a rather radical idea for their day. Until they put out The Beatles Songbook in June, 1964, teen-pop, the music of Top 40 Radio, was generally considered off-limits for an easy listening instrumental treatment. You didn't here orchestral arrangements of the hits of Fabian, Dion and the Belmonts or the Everly Brothers on the radio or in restaurants and offices. Those songs were kids' songs and the whole genre of rock'n'roll was considered musically worthless. Then came the Beatles and that changed everything. By March, 1965 Time Magazine ran a cover story on the pop/rock scene, by Autumn, 1965 the Beatles would record Yesterday with a string quartet and get airplay on ""Adult"" stations and by 1967 Leonard Bernstein would be praising pop on a network TV special.

But this was in 1964, long before all that, when the idea of orchestral arrangements of Beatles and Beach Boys songs must have seemed like a crazy idea. The project may have been just Capitol Records (who were the Beatles U.S. label) way of further jumping on the Beatlemania Bandwagon as everybody else was trying to do, or it may have been a creative person at Capitol recognizing the melodious sound of the Beatles songs and how it would easily transpose. The work in any case fell to Stu Phillips, a noted composer-arranger whether or not it was his original idea. He was a graduate of the Eastman School of Music who had made easy listening albums for Capitol under his own name, and for Colpix Records produced hit songs Johnny Angel (Shelly Fabares), My Dad (Paul Peterson), Blue Moon (Marcels) and Goodbye Cruel World (James Darren). It was this familiarity with contemporary pop that gave him the ability to orchestrate it without losing its vitality.

The Beach Boys Songbook was the second release by the Hollyridge Strings who, of course, were whatever studio orchestra musicians Capitol had at the time, and it came out in the Fall of 1964. The sound of the orchestra is very transparent (helped by excellent remastering here), with the strings accompanied by horns, trumpets, flutes and extensive use of piano. As you'd expect, songs like Don't Worry Baby and In My Room lend themselves easily to this treatment, and She knows Me Too Well is a particular standout with its elaborate piano part. But the more rocking songs come out intact with all their punch, even Surfin' USA and I Get Around, which boldly leads off the album. This is no sleepy Mantovani strings oversaturating the tunes but an authentically creative reimagining of Brian Wilson's melodies that retains their spirit.

This album got as much play from me as the actual Beach Boys albums in late 1964 (note because Capitol also had the Beach Boys a tune like Wendy which was on the Top 40 when this album was released was able to be included). Stu Phillips went on to compose many movie scores and television themes and is noted for his music for Battlestar Gallactica.",1,0.0

8174,"This is ok but i would suggest buying only a few of these mp3s separately you aren't missing anything money money every where and many 2 or 3 more including the affirmations track.
i think maybe this wasn't what i thought it would be this si about providing good service to your customers, i lack appropriate opportunities so maybe i should search for that
but ive ran into this problem before with her albums but i still was able to grow and still received something positive out of it
ok i am editing my review 4/27/16 from four stars to 2 (being nice)
ok heres why i will not purchase her mp3 again.
even though there were aspects of this mp3 i did not like i still used it. i noticed my attitude twords other people changed, i started getting more of a ""kanye west"" syndrome and believe that i shouldn't have to work for my success (as suggested in this mp3)  i actually shouldntve bought the whole cd.
but what i will say on a positive bullet is that i care less about others and feel as though people should pay me regardless ... i was actually raised to be the best i can be and its very hard and immoral to do some of the things suggested here.
honestly im not in a situation to ""pick and choose"" things often. so to pick and choose things based on ""quality"" is not a healthy option. i think this mp3 should have been more well thought out as everyone's situations are different. though it has given me courage to do things that needed to be done in a less than merciful way. what hurts the most is the acknowledgement of people who do not work hard who achieve massive success. i think this made my situation worse and more depressing if anything. i mean obviously a person buying this self help mp3 works hard and deserves more money however suggesting to be like those just born lucky is a hard pill to swallow im sorry.
ive worked hard my whole life and all it did was bring to light that i am NOT wealthy as i should be. as in my previous reveiw i would suggest to purchase money money everywhere. the othe mp3s are for people who probably do not work hard and ARE poor. oh and the other one about having a roommate who doesnt clean up after them selves is good. but i would never recommend this to a loved one as a whole mp3/cd just those 2. i found a similar mp3 by hypnosis live which says what she say but in a shorter yet more GRACEFUL way.
what anna thompson usually does are audio shamanic journeys. i think if your into that you will probably buy her mp3s but the problem is trusting what she is saying. so in conclusion the only thing positive that happend is me firing people who i should have fired along time ago.
all of the other results im not comfortable with oh yeah & one of those is starting accounts one to save and one to give away... um i stopped being as generous a long time ago because i honestly do not have the money to be donating to charities & i subconsciously had been giving me thinking ""oh it will come back"" after i realized why i stopped giving so much..its cuz I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY! i noticed after i realized i had less money. it makes me look like im rich to other people who probably want to use me though i don't know how great that is.
im glad i could do it in the future but right now i really need all of my money and can not afford to be Ms generosity all of the time people should be generous to me more often ijs cuz i really aint got it like that.
i think her intentions are good but for something like this i would suggest something more customized.",0,0.0

8184,"Floating out there just below the asteroid belt in a near earth orbit, The Avant Garde touched down momentarily back in 1968, where this twosome, in much the same manner as the songs McAuthur Park by Richard Harris, and of course Scott McKenzies San Francisco attempted to capitalize and co-opt on the hippie counter culture movement with two of the most insincere songs of all time, Naturally Stoned and Yellow Beads. In Yellow Beads they nearly talk through the song, as if imparting some special and essential secret knowledge that only they were privileged to, suggesting in a creepy manner as to what was necessary if one was considering heading out onto the hippy highway headed west into the sun  through truth be told, the counter culture daze of San Francisco nights was already splintering and crashing to the ground in a haze of hard drugs and unpleasantness.

Without hesitation, it should be understood that this was commercialism at its finest and most blatant, offering nothing of value, because these two were never part of the times from which they pretended to be.  Oddly enough Fowler and Woolery did manage to make the big time, with Fowler doing session guitar work for both Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen, and Woolery becoming the eternal television gameshow host.

Happily this duo, and these songs, have been lost to space and time, surfacing only in odd collections that one nearly happens upon, making me to this very day feel damaged, taken advantage of, ripped off if you will, that tracks such as these would ever be considered as anything less than disingenuous.  But, time has an odd specter to it, wherein a spinning galaxy brings all things back full circle  causing me wonder how many lightyears it will be before the worlds Oh Wow slip through the parted lips some cute blonde in bellbottom hip-hugger pants as she hears these songs for the first time, thinking shes discovered a touchstone, a piece of the holy grail, or the X on a treasure map that never existed.

8223,"Please don't get me wrong - Agostino Steffani's music is wonderful. It's just this performance and recording that are awful, and I already described the reasons why in a 2009 review under Amazon's other entry for this recording:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alarico/dp/B001U1L9ZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alarico</a>. However, I've been prompted to take a fresh look at it, and of course to do some more listening, after the sudden recent appearance of two glowing five-star reviews, appearing on both this and the other product page (although in the latter case, I see, they have both been deleted again at the same time today, February 18th 2015), praising this recording in similar and very fulsome terms.

Those two reviews were posted by reviewers Magda Levi and Yoav Rothberger, both gilding the lily by adding admiring comments on each other's work. (Stop press: since reading the rest of this, they've now changed their Amazon names to 'ML' and 'A Customer' respectively. Hang on - now they've both deleted their reviews on this page as well, and all their other Amazon reviews!) I'll avoid commenting on the details of the latter's review directly - firstly because, apart from the last paragraph, all the rest has been copied word for word from an entry by Bruno Belli on the website of Luca Casagrande, director and singer in this recording, so there isn't really anything plausible or significant by Mr. Rothberger himself to comment on. Secondly, that reviewer evidently doesn't take kindly to anyone expressing an opinion different from his own, but prefers to resort to ill-mannered language and personal insults to try to prove his point - as could be seen from the comments after the first review I wrote, again on the other product page cited above, although he has since deleted those comments. And thirdly, Mr. Rothberger appears to have a small claque of baroque music enthusiasts at his disposal, who are happy to vote in support of all his comments and to class as unhelpful any comments by anybody else - all, as if by magic, within just a few minutes of the comments being posted. Perhaps a similar fate awaits the present review!

This leaves me with Magda Levi's review, which contains substantial passages copied word for word, without any acknowledgment, from Chapter 8 of Professor Colin Timms' monograph&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Polymath-of-the-Baroque-Agostino-Steffani-and-His-Music/dp/0195154738/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Polymath of the Baroque: Agostino Steffani and His Music</a>&nbsp;- from the section entitled `Music and drama in `Alarico il Baltha' '. Ms Levi also has connections with Luca Casagrande's website, having recently contributed some material to it. However, Ms Levi does also add some points of her own to her `Alarico' review here on Amazon, so I will address some of these. In particular, she singles out a number of the singers for fulsome praise - several of whom, to my ears, sound absolutely dreadful and sing wildly out of tune. In my previous review, I tried to avoid causing too much offense by not naming the worst singers individually, and I will repeat that concession here - except in the case of Luca Casagrande, who directs the ensemble and also sings the important baritone role of Pisone. He sings frequently and painfully out of tune, and must also take overall responsibility for this mostly awful performance and recording.

Reviewer Ms Levi also makes the point that this was a young cast of singers, around 30 to 35 years of age. Perhaps this is with a view to our making allowances for their youth or inexperience; but are we really expected to make such extreme allowances when we pay out the substantial cost of a three-disc opera set? Besides, I would say that if they can't sing in tune - or at all - by that age then they're unlikely to get much better over the next 35 years.

This recording has a few assets - for example, the able and stylish playing by the instrumentalists of the Scarlatti Camera Ensemble, and the singing of such as mezzo Lee Ji-Young (Honorio) and soprano Won Mi-Jung Capilupi (Placidia); bass Marco Democratico (Lidoro) is not too bad either, at least having a decent voice if not great style. The greatest asset of all, of course, is Steffani's music, and I'd greatly love to hear it in a decent recording. But here, I'm sorry to say, much of it is ruined by the poor singing and close, harsh, wiry recorded sound. To take just a couple of examples, Stilicone's beautiful chaconne-based aria in Act 1, Scene 15, `Gelosia, lasciami in pace' is wrecked by poor singing and dreadful sound quality; and the lovely duet between Semiamira and Stilicone in Act 3 Scene 3, `Care Fiamme/ Amate Catene', is ruined by the same factors.

It's also worth mentioning that Steffani's roles intended for male altos are sung here by mezzo and contralto - a practice praised by some reviewers and criticised by others. In fact there appears to be a small but persistent lobby, noticeable among certain reviewers both here and on the Italian Amazon website, who are firmly prejudiced against the countertenor voice and on that basis attempt to discredit the work of great singers such as Philippe Jaroussky and Claudio Cavina.

Returning to the main business, however, the principal drawbacks of the present recording are dreadful singing, terrible recorded sound and the absence of any sense of involvement, drama or cohesion. And, if there were any argument at all for scoring it with a second star - which in my view there isn't - I'd immediately take one star off again for dodgy practices. If musicians seek public approval for their work, they would do much better to come up with a few decent performances and recordings, rather than produce something like this effort and then try to get their supporters to rig the reviews. Most of us here on Amazon, whether readers or reviewers, are not that stupid.",0,0.0

This album sounds somewhat different to his past albums with the band Morbo, but he still manages to create beautiful soothing sounds and catchy hooks. The tempo of the songs is also slower and the lyrics more personal, never intending to possibly land any hits on the charts and therefore the production is noticeably crafted with care. Because he will always be linked to the band that brought him to the spotlight, Moenia, it is fair to compare this production with his fellow former band member Alfonso Pichardo, whose solo release went unnoticed but it was due to being hardly an effort or anything novel. That isn't the case with ""Nada Haces Por Mi."" Repeat listens will be required but simply because it is very enjoyable album.",1,0.0

8244,"Bought this because it's the closing track in Princess Jellyfish.  It wasn't available last time I looked for it, so I was super happy to see it when I was trolling Amazon for anime themes last night.

There's another version available, too (listing the artist as ""Team Akihabara"").  That version is 1:54, while this one is just over 3:40.  (I bought both.)  This one seems to be the full-length track while the other seems to be the cut version that runs into and during the Princess Jellyfish closing credits.  (At least, I'm pretty sure that's the difference.  According to YouTube, the runtime on the closing credits is around 1:30, and that's *without* about 25-30 seconds of the ""Love is coming back"" bit and the musical lead-in to the primary lyrics. And btw, both versions include the intro.)  While this particular compilation credits the composer/arranger (Yamaguchi Takashi), it doesn't credit the artist, which Google tells me is Sambomaster.

8255,"Too often now a days jazz is associated with elevator music. Well, this ain't elevator music. It's Everyday Magic, the second album from Nashville native, Rahsaan Barber

What's more, this album was recorded in Nashville - Music City USA. Nashville may be forever associated with country music, but, let me tell you, they have some cats down there that can blow. The band, also called Everyday Magic, is composed of Barber on tenor, alto and soprano sax as well as flute. Adam Agati on guitar, pianist Jody Nardone, Jerry Navarro on bass (and what a tasty bottom end he plays) and Nioshi Jackson on the skins. Rahsaan's twin brother, Roland Barber is on trombone on two hot tracks, as is percussionist Giovanni Rodriguez.  The album is released on Rahsaan's newly formed Jazz Music City label.

The album is laid out to display Rahsaan's virtuosity on all the saxes and flute, as well as his various influences. It opens with a bopping tenor show case tune, ""Jubilee"".The first thing that becomes apparent is Rahsaan's articulation on whatever instrument he features. It matters not how fast the tune, the clarity of the notes are amazing. This tune just grooves and brings back memories of John Coltrane or Kenny Garret.

from there, Rahsaan and the band cover the whole spectrum a jazz influences, Bop, Avant Garde, Gospel, Blues. Perhaps my favorite tune on the whole album is ""Why So Blue"", an in-your-face blues romp that'll make you think of Stanley Turrentine. Twin brother, Roland Barber is featured on some fine trombone work where he seems to be echoing Rahsaan's gritty tenor. Great work, family style.

Another highlight is, ""Innocence"", featuring soprano sax work that continues to show of Rahsaan's mastery of the different saxophones. The drummer, Nioshi Jackson,  lays down an infectious stutter-step solo and the interplay between the sax and the guitar is just killer. Close your eyes, and you can see a couple of kids playing in a spring garden. In ""Adagio"", Rahsaan finally shows off his flute work. As the title suggests, this is a sweet, quiet, slow tune. Rahsaan says it was composed on a dare to create a meditative spa kind of music. The album closes out with ""Memphis Soul"", a tight, electronic groove featuring percussionist Giovanni Rodriguez of the Latin-jazz septet, El Movimeinto which is co-lead by Rahsaan.

This is a great debut for the label and a more than fine sophomore effort from Rahsaan and Everyday Magic.  It may not be elevator music, but it is going nowhere but up.",1,0.0

Electric Six are sonic pioneers; they are loud pilgrims who set sail on the sea of American cheese in search of musical freedom to offer you the best songs instruments can make.
My greatest regret is that I didn't have the cash to hire Electric Six to play at my wedding, as there is no music more romantic and intimate as this.

8290,"Non sempre  necessario rivolgere la propria attenzione agli States per ascoltare ottimo Southern Rock o per cercare interessanti novit, e quindi sono davvero contento di segnalare l'eccellente album d' esordio di una band tutta italiana proveniente da Lodi.

Gli Smokey Fingers sono un quartetto fomato da Gianluca ""Luke"" Paterniti ( voce), Fabrizio Costa (basso), Daniele Vacchini (batteria e percussioni) e
Diego ""Bleef"" Dragoni (chitarra elettrica e acustica) e ci offrono un album lungo e articolato con 12 tracce da ascoltare a tutto volume per godere in pieno tutta l'energia e grande passione per il rock di tradizione Southern che li contraddistingue.

Fin dalla opener ""Old Jack"", dal riff immediato e trascinante come pochi, si percepisce subito l'ottimo impatto sonoro e qualit compositiva della band e non  difficile immaginarsi in sella a una potente moto lungo le highway come quella raffigurata proprio sulla copertina dell'album.

Le atmosfere tipicamente southern tra puro rock'n roll e country rock, le ritroviamo in pezzi come Born to Run, Over the Line, The Good Countryside, tracce che da sole valgono l'acquisto, Crazy Woman e nella conclusiva Devil's Song, mentre in tracce come The Lover, Chains of Mind e Die for the Glory traspare tutta la passione per un heavy rock di chiara ispirazione anni '70/'80,  ma non mancano momenti melodici ( mai sdolcinati ) dove fanno capolino ottime atmosfere country western.
Da sottolineare alla traccia n. 10 una personalissima e grintosa versione della celebre Country Road del grande James Taylor.

In sostanza un ottimo debutto discografico con un album molto piacevole, graffiante, potente e di grande atmosfera per chi ama il Southern Rock e il rock'n roll sanguigno e polveroso in genere, per una band da seguire con attenzione.

A volte si celebrano ed esaltano prodotti di per s ""normali"" magari solo perch provenienti da luoghi di grande tradizione musicale per quanto riguarda il Southern Rock nello specifico, ebbene questo Columbus Way  certamente un ottimo album che vale la pena acquistare e godersi a tutto volume, con una punta di orgoglio per una band italiana di questo livello.",1,0.0

8324,"Until Tony MacAlpine was forced to form a hair rock ensemble in late 1990, the disparity between 1988's ""Children"" and 1990's ""Carved In Sand"" represented the single biggest drop off in quality between consecutive albums in the history of recorded music.  True, ""Children"" was an aberration - great music, good lyrics, perfect order, outstanding mix, lush orchestrations and tons of vision.  Never before had The Mission risen to that level and, sadly, never would they approach it again.  ""Carved In Sand"" has none of the aforementioned elements.  The titles alone betray the lack of ideas.  When your opener is inspired by an ABC TV special, you know there's trouble.  ""Into The Blue"" isn't a half bad song until Reeves Gabrels shows up (and ruins it).  ""Butterfly On A Wheel"" suffers from boredom more so than anything.  I'd critique ""Sea Of Love"" except I can't remember a note from it.  ""Deliverance"" almost delivers until Simon Hinkler unveils perhaps the most annoying guitar tone of its time.  The ennui resumes in ""The Grapes Of Wrath"" (check out Camel's ""Dust And Dreams"" for a slightly more compelling treatment of John Steinbeck's novel).  You're so disenchanted that by the 7th track, ""Belief"" you are momentarily deceived into thinking it's a good song.  However, 4 minutes into the 7 minute opus, when you realize you're just hearing the same idea over and over and over and over, well, the luster lessens.  I would later learn it's best to stop the CD after ""Belief"" because the spiral downward (with apologies to Trent Reznor) is steep.  Honestly, how can any song titled ""Paradise Will Shine (Like The Moon Tonight)"" be any good?  Answer:  it can't (and isn't).  I don't remember a thing about ""Hungry As The Hunter"" other than an annoying ""yeah, yeah!"" that followed every chorus.  ""Lovely"" I believe is a brief acoustic piece that feature's Hussey non-too-lovely speaking voice.  All in all, this is a terribly written, dreadfully performed, incompetently recorded (by Tim Palmer, of all people) and downright insulting piece of half-baked nonsense.  The band itself was so disillusioned that they released all their outtakes in the hopes that they actually had an idea somewhere (1991's ""Grains Of Sand"").

8357,"David Bethany - True Love (Independent)
South Carolina singer-songwriter David Bethany has certainly earned his musical spurs. He's the ex-frontman of The Killer Whales (check out their 1983 album ""Emotional Geography"" - produced by Jamie Hoover), and he's shared stages with Bonnie Raitt, Richard Thompson, Johnny Winter, George Thorogood, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Molly Hatchet. They say variety is the spice of life and anyone who's been musically involved with such a diverse group of artists must like mixing it up. So it is on ""True Love"", where he employs island rhythms, ska guitars, Americana melodies and blue moves. His voice, somewhere between Jackson Browne and John Hiatt, is easy and likeable, and adds some classic `70s singer-songwriter flair to a collection of songs that feel personal and real.

Highlights come thick and fast. The title track makes an immediate impression with its Caribbean beat, hint of brass and a song (and vocal) that should be owning daytime BBC radio. ""Scotch for Supper, Cigarettes for Dessert"" almost lives up to its title, and features the most restrained and gentle of guitar solos; the sort of thing that JJ Cale would be proud of. ""Can't Hold On"" cruises dangerously close to perfection. An organ fed melody releases a country-rock groove, then a wandering trumpet mirrors the tune and takes it off to beautiful new worlds. It's an inspired three and a half minutes, and will undoubtedly be a massive hit in some as yet undiscovered parallel universe, where such things as genuine soul and tender, heartfelt songwriting are coveted.",1,1.0

You don't ever want to regret not having said everything you needed to say to them while they are still here.

8398,"As a Christian music enthusiast, I often run across an individual or a band that has yet to be discovered by others. However, it is a rare moment when my ears are pleased and my heart is touched. On one such occasion I was relaxing at home watching ""Reflections"". Daystar produces this television program which showcases nature-loving videos with scripture notes accompanied with mostly instrumental melodies.

On this one specific night I had my eyes closed and suddenly this voice began to awaken and touch my soul. Then the message began to sink in and I had to rewind it to find out who it was. When they first started singing he reminded me slightly of Chris August but as the song continued it was more like the style of Jason Upton. It was melodically and lyrically beautiful. To my delight the person's name was a mystery causing me to speak to myself like I was Sherlock Holmes.

Kristian Binion was the answer to the riddle at that moment and God is the master of his talent. A graduate from Christ for the Nations International he learned early on what the significance of a close relationship with Jesus Christ brings to writing. With gifted musicians like Kari Jobe and others you have to wonder, what does this University instill in their students that other colleges do not?

I received his current EP, which sadly only includes three songs. The first single on the album is the notable song I heard that evening and title of the EP, ""Pieces"". It speaks about how fragile we are and how often times we don't feel worthy of repair. However, God sees us as a moldable project as He restores us and makes us new.

This song really touched my heart as I sit discovering this artist as he moved my spirit. It is so personal and speaks to those who have a broken and contrite heart. At some point we all experience moments of heartbreak and desperation. It could be the loss of a loved one or a feeling of rejection. It could also be backslider who was once close to God who has fallen and is trying to find their way back. All of these scenarios fit the message, along with many others I have not mentioned. The closing segment is one of the most powerful lyrics I have heard recently. ""When this world pushes my heart to break. But every piece of it sings your praise. If it takes falling to see your face, then somebody push me for Heavens sake.""

Kristian's heart is all about making God famous and hoping his worship will touch someone that needs to know that God is the answer to every problem they will ever face. We all have broken pieces or areas the world has vexed us in and if we turn everything over to Him, He can make something out of us to use for His glory. I have found myself asking God to keep me broken so that I never want to leave His side. Being near to God at all times is vital to our spiritual health and growth.

I cannot express to you how gifted this young man is. You just have to be inclined to discover him for yourself. I do believe that he has a huge future ahead of him musically and spiritually leading people in worship and to a closer walk with Christ through his ministry.

The second song on the release is titled ""Narrow Way"". This is a message that is urgent for the Body of Christ today and the title is exactly what it is about. Many people today are on the broad path that leads to destruction. They have been tossed about with every wind of doctrine and spoon fed grace to a point they feel a personal relationship and repentance is not required of them. Kristian lays his heart on the floor before the Lord in this beautiful adoration of a man desiring to exemplify Christ. ""I wanna say what you would say. I wanna love the same way. Until everything I do is a reflection of you. I will follow the path you've made along the narrow way. There's a ladder you can climb to pull yourself up to the sky. But you will be sure to find you will fall if you get to high. But that ladder it leads back down where the humble and broken are found.""

After listening to the third song ""Strong Tower"", I was extremely unsettled about the fact that there were no more for me to listen to. This song brought out a different sound from Kristian and I had a hard time deciding which I liked better. It was at that point that I decided God's perfect number is three and this EP is one hundred and ten percent fascinating. That being said I am looking forward to seeing what God has in store for this extraordinarily gifted young man.

Eager to see how long I was going to have to wait to hear more from Kristian, I asked him when he was going to bless us all with a full length album.

Kristian - ""I'm currently writing new songs to go along with a lot more that didn't make the EP. I am praying and believing God for a full-length record someday. I know it will happen in His timing. Meanwhile, I plan to start recording some acoustic videos of new songs that God has given me. Those should be coming very soon!""

As someone who is passionate about writing for God I asked what advice Kristian would share with others who have a dream to sing and minister and to share God with others in song.

Kristian - ""I would say don't ever let anything stop you! Not even yourself! I struggled for a long time with not feeling adequate or good enough. It wasn't until I surrendered to God and stopped worrying about what people thought. I started reading the word and seeking Him and God started dropping songs in my heart. I would tell God how you feel, ask Him to write through you. It may not come right away but God is faithful and He will begin to birth songs in your heart that will draw people to Him.""

Today you see a lot of youth struggling with choices either to fit in at school or with their friends outside of school. They are willing often times to sacrifice the gifts God has placed in them to use for His Kingdom for momentary popularity. As a young man himself growing up with the temptations and trials of youth I was curious what or who influenced him to lay everything at the cross and truly walk with Christ.

Kristian -"" I would have to say my Grandfather, V.R. Mitchell. I was going through a time in my life where I was not really living completely for God. I mean, I loved God and I knew how to act and knew what to say to make it seem like we were close. But in reality I was riding the fence. While I was visiting with my Grandfather one day it was like he knew exactly what was going on. But he didn't give me a speech or tell me I was a sinner. He just very calmly grabbed my hand looked me straight in the eyes as I was leaving and said ""Son, Grab a hold of Jesus and don't ever let him Go! That's all he said but it was all I needed! Instantly I knew it was God speaking through him. And I will never forget that moment the rest of my life! That is what I would say to a young person who is struggling to fit in. DON'T FIT IN! Grab a hold Of Jesus and don't ever let Go! It's not always easy and we are human. We will mess up. But don't ever forget to cling to Jesus it's the only way to make it.""

Kristian is right we are human and we all mess up, but one thing is for certain he did everything right on this EP. Check it out for yourself and take advantage of being the first person to share his music with someone else. Trust me when I say don't let someone else steal your blessing from doing so. I hope and pray that this review may open doors for Kristian to explore that full-length album because I personally don't know how long I can wait to hear it.

I would like to give special recognition for musicians, mixers and producers who made ""Pieces"" what it is. Thank you Daniel Lopez, Will Coleman, Josh Dufrene and Gregg Dunham for assisting Kristian by making this EP available. To order this EP please visit his website at [...]",1,1.0

Line up:
Bozena Mazur - vocal
Andrzej Serafin - keyboards, dr, perc, vibes, broomstick bass, sampling & furnace
Staszek Grela - guitars
Robert ""Los Agentos"" Lenert - harmonicas

Wladek Wiater - saxophones (track 11)

Slawek Wierzcholski - harmonica solo (track 18)
Marta Lis - vocal (track 15)

""Poza horyzont"" (Beyond The Horizon) is a second album of Los Agentos in that line-up. After the great ""Afrykanski Snieg"" (""African Snow"") it is the time for something same ""twisted"", but in a different way. African sounds are, maybe not totally removed, but mostly replaced by jazz. Again everything is thanks to Andrzej Serafin, who changed his African traps to different ones, for example... central heating stove (!  which,  as the musician claims, tunes in D! The recording is highly eclectic, full of intricate harmonic solutions and deep, warm tones. It is a real windfall  for every lover of the music which  you cannot classify anyhow but as beautiful one.  Serafin's genius is completed with Staszek Grela's soft guitar and nice, dark vocal of Bozena Mazur. But despite appearances the music is not easy to deal with. The recordings are filled with ambient, psychedelia, acid jazz and samples which makes mood of gnosis, mystery, soaring to the higher level of perception. For sure it is the best Polish album of the year! And just think that all that ""mess"" came to existence thanks to the concept that rose in the head of Robert Lenert, the band leader, and with this idea, there was beauty and new dimension of art to rise...

8462,"Melia - Soundproof Walls (Independent)
A musician for just four years, Melia Kimberly Maccarone has already made serious inroads into a promising career. ""Soundproof Walls"" is her debut long-player, recorded with her band (Dominic Ciaccia - drums, Tim Latus - bass, Rob Cerame - guitar), with Melia responsible for lead guitar, vocals and the songs. That's quite a load for a 20-year old, but she seems completely unfazed, and her all-round performance is incredibly confident, leading her band through a collection of brash pop-punk and upbeat ska-rock.

The production on ""Soundproof"" is gloriously vibrant; the music almost leaps from the speakers. It's absolutely appropriate, as there's nothing lo-fi or half-hearted here. Melia's songs are focused and vivacious, falling somewhere between the navet and pop thrill of early Blondie and No Doubt's Jamaican infused bombast. Surely it can be no coincidence that ""I Wanna Be Your Girl"" brings out Melia's inner Gwen Stefani. It remains a highlight of the seven-track set, though there's no shortage of competition. ""Checking Out"" possesses a great vocal hook and serious guitars; ""Sleaze Parade"" is complex and technical, and thoroughly enjoyable. ""Stay"" indicates a talent for balladry, which might come in handy, should the mainstream come calling.",1,0.0

8519,"The following review is the result of extensive road testing on three different days and under different driving conditions, including suburban freeway, California coastline (both sunny and overcast), and suburban surface street.
The most striking thing about this record on a first listen is the strength and consistency of the songcraft. One after another the songs have catchy, hummable, moving, memorable tunes. ""Romeo & Juliet"" is reminiscent of the first original Lynch tune this reviewer heard (circa 1980), whose name is forgotten, but which sounded like an amalgamation of parts of five great lost Beatles songs all crammed into a single song; ""Romeo & Juliet"" also has more ideas than it needs, though the reference points here seem closer to Bob Seeger or Tom Petty or Thin Lizzy (see below), but it puts them together in a way that makes sense. Lynch's invention is equally effective in producing anthems, swampy rockers, folk-pop, and ballads. I've heard few albums by anyone on which the songs are so consistently effective; they are radio-ready exemplars of their respective genres without being generic, and one can imagine them being successfully performed by a number of different artists.
On a second listen one notices the lyrics. Rock music really does, to some degree, all sound alike; it's built on clichs. Most good rock music either transcends the clichs to find the original emotional force that motivated them, or acknowledges them with some degree of usually affectionate irony. These songs do both (a rare balance: Richard Thompson is another writer who has mastered this in his rock compositions). There are plenty of cars and girls and familiar rhymes, but Lynch recognizes their familiarity. In some songs, like ""Romeo & Juliet,"" the clichs are wallowed in and milked for all their resonant effect, though the song still manages to find a new image in the tried and true situation, such as Juliet's face illuminated by the brake light--viewed presumably in the mirror by the driver who is leaving her behind with someone else. One of the best songs on the album, ""The Best is Yet to Come,"" uses a device often used to good effect by Neil Young: mixing seemingly unrelated narratives and leaving the listener to figure out the possible connections. The haunting last line of that song (before the repeated chorus) is this reviewer's favorite of the album.
Many of the songs reference rock music itself, and particularly its relationship to time and aging (another Youngian theme). ""Black Irish Rocker"" salutes with affectionate humor the aspirations of all rockers for authenticity, regardless of race, creed, color . . . or age. The speaker is not a teenager hoping to grow up to be guitar god but a middle aged married man who at first wistfully imagines being reincarnated as Phil Lynott, the Thin Lizzy frontman who parodixcally combined two conventional signs of authenticity, blackness and Irishness, to renew what might otherwise be the most easily parodied persona in hard rock (Irish blues guitarist Rory Gallagher provides another aspirational model of achieving authenticity by defying stereotypes). Rather than trying to return him to reality, his wife encourages him not to dream such dreams but to try to live them. He confesses to her that ""it's been getting harder / to separate reality from the dream,"" to which, in a beautifully enigmatic detail, ""she smiles her little private smile to herself; / she says, `I know exactly what you mean.'"" There's a black Irish rocker in all of us who (to paraphrase Mr. Young) should not be denied.
The song titles suggest the larger theme of the album: ""The Best Is Yet to Come,"" ""Where Have All the Good Times Gone?,"" ""Rock `n' Roll Ghost."" This is classic rock about classic rock that asks how we should respond when we find ourselves 20 or 30 years on and still hearing its siren promise of ecstatic fulfillment. Some rockers burn out, some fade away into conventional adulthood, but some (think again Neil Young or the Rolling Stones) demonstrate that rather than seeming absurd in the old, sticking with rock in fact helps keep them young, which is to say it sustains in them a spiritual if not physical vitality as they grow and face age and ultimate oblivion.
More prosaically, but further evidence of the album's implicit argument, the playing is an impressive example of DYI ethos, with Lynch playing all instruments with tasteful economy, deploying a wide variety of guitar styles as called for by the particular situation, deploying a tambourine for just a measure or two (one imagines him waiting alone in the studio through the entire song to add that important detail), or walking a nifty bass line through the spaces in the plaintive ""Grace Hollogne."" Finally (and especially for personal friends), Lynch's vocals deserve mention. His voice seems to have deepened over the years into a seaworthy instrument weathered like the deck of a well-used and well-maintained wooden boat (perhaps a gift of what one hopes is a long-abandoned smoking habit); the timbre perfectly suits the songs, but more important is the singing itself, which uses its own restraint as a source of expressiveness and authenticity.
There are many forms of talent on display in this record--songwriting, lyrical cleverness, musicianship, production, singing--but the deep, solid mineral vein running through it is its awareness and renewal, in each song, of the power of this sort of music to keep an aging engine oiled and running.",1,0.0

8526,"The idea here is that if you like Beethoven, you ought to like these other composers from Beethoven's classical era. It works for me. I already have lots of Beethoven in my collection, and lots of Mozart and Haydn who inspired Beethoven, and lots of Schubert and Weber who were the young up-and-comers weened on Beethoven. They're all here, along with Hummel, a very good but often overlooked contemporary, as well as Spohr, Sor, Cherubini, Kuhlau, Dussek, and Guiliani.

What this collection makes me realize is that although Beethoven is said be the composer who most bridged the classical and romantic eras, he really seems to me to fit more squarely in the classical era. Two of Mozart's final works, the Requiem and Jupiter Symphony, greatly foreshadow Beethoven. When Beethoven ""went retro"" with his 8th Symphony (did he invent musical nostalgia?), he seemed to be aping Haydn's Clock Symphony. And even two of Schubert's most romantic works, the Unfinished Symphony and ""Death and the Maiden"", are still very classically structured compared with what was to come next from Liszt, Berlioz, Schumann and on. And nobody in any era ever sounded like Beethoven's later most advanced piano sonatas and string quartets. This is very rewarding listening and all top class stuff as X5 usually is.",1,1.0

Well friends, this is an album whose cover art tells you everything you need to know: A stock image of a sunset sky, with a cross overlay, with the words ""Christian Dubstep"" prominently plastered at the bottom with an ugly waveform graphic behind it, made basically invisible by the text. I was hoping that the producer was better than the graphic designer, but alas, they are not.

I was initially looking for the ""This is Christian Dubstep [year]"" series of albums I found while wandering the internet. The Amazon Music client led me here. I was particularly intrigued by the list of familiar song titles - ""Strong Tower"" by Kutless, a personal favorite, ""O Praise Him"" and ""History Maker"", two worship songs I sang in youth group, and of course ""How Great is Our God"", 2006's 'Trendy Christian song of the Year' award winner. This intrigue was evenly inspired by thoughts of ""I wonder how these songs sound as dubstep?"" and ""I wonder how much paperwork went into getting the acapellas for these tracks to make them?"" As I thought a bit more as my poky DSL line was buffering, I was like, ""wait...this probably won't end well"", and I was right.

The vocals on all the tracks are not original - they're either karaoke tracks or separately recorded - only the lyrics are the same. The tempo and sounds used have little variance between tracks; in many cases they're flat-out off-key. They kept the exact same progression of the songs as the originals. This can be a good thing, but it's clear that the only thing that changed between copy/pasting the 'dubstep' overlays was cutting out a measure here or there to match the different songs, rather than actually reimagining them.

I wouldn't necessarily call myself a true dubstep fan, but I do DJ for youth events, so I do spend plenty of time listening to a wide variety of Christian music. Christian music is its own topic of discussion and debate, but I generally find that they tend to be 'a genre behind' secular music. Just as Christian rock started to get good, the world shifted to urban/rap - and on the whole, the early Christian rap albums weren't that good. Christian rap started to get good - I'd dare argue 'better than secular rap' - in the past few years, just as the world has moved on to EDM and its cousins, 'dance pop' and 'dubstep'. While artists like Har Megiddo, Matthew Parker, and a few others do a half-decent job at making some tracks worth listening to (again, the 'This is Christian Dubstep 2012/2013/2014' albums also having a few gems), overall, I consider this album to embody the worst aspects of the Christian music business, genre, and culture.

I *very* rarely give single star reviews to anything, but when something is not only itself of poor quality, but is able to single-handedly illustrate literally every gripe I've had with Christian music in the past two decades, and the ""B-side cuts"" on other albums are better than the best that this one has to offer, that one-star is well-earned.",0,0.0

8632,"'North Of The Border' was recorded in July 1967 and involves Duke Ellington performing as solo pianist with the Ron Collier Orchestra. The album was part of a project to showcase the work of Canadian musicians, and Ellington's presence was intended to give it some extra cachet.

The Canadian CD issue, released in 1995 on Attic, includes a 25 minute interview involving Ellington which gives some useful background information, as long as the listener is prepared to read between the lines. ""I never really think in terms of having the piano solo responsibility"", says Ellington. Asked how he liked having Ellington as his piano soloist, Collier responds: ""Oh it was a wonderful experience and opportunity Ted, but it had its frightening moments, I'll tell you!"" John Norris, a jazz writer and critic, is asked to give a 'quick critical analysis' of the resulting music. ""Now you really put me on the spot, Ted!"", he exclaims, before offering the expected platitudes. Putting it bluntly, if you haven't already got the picture, some of the music on this album is very undistinguished, and some of Ellington's soloing is inept.

I can excuse Ellington's ineptitude. He can be quite brilliant as a pianist who introduces, accompanies, fills or acts as a foil to another player. As he says himself, he is not really a soloist. Also, I suspect that more technically proficient pianists than Ellington might have viewed the prospect of soloing over some of this music as a thankless task. To quote Charles Mingus:

""You can't improvise on nothin', man. You gotta improvise on somethin'.""

Ellington's playing illustrates this point quite beautifully. On the pretentious and rambling 'Nameless Hour' Ellington is hopelessly and cruelly exposed. He fares only marginally better on the appalling 'Silent Night, Lonely Night' and there are moments in 'Aurora Borealis' when it sounds as if Ellington wishes the earth would swallow him up. His best effort is reserved for 'Song And Dance', a song that has a recognisable theme; something for the featured soloist to get his teeth into.

Ellington collectors might find items of interest here, as I have. Viewed as a whole, though, this is a pretty soulless collection. The group of featured composers allowed themselves to be labelled 'Third Stream', a movement attempting to fuse jazz and classical music. It appears that they were more interested in finding the Stream than in writing songs.",0,0.0

8647,"Wess Floyd - Foxhole Confessions (Blind Roar/TIAM)
It seemed for a long time that The Replacements mix of punk attitude, power pop licks and unapologetic Americana had been and gone, and potential new torch carriers were decidedly thin on the ground. Of course, bands like The Hold Steady and The Gaslight Anthem changed all that, and now let's add Wess Floyd's name to the list. Not that he's a Johnny-come-lately by any means. His debut record (""The Daisycutters EP"") first saw the light of day as far back as 2006, and the most cursory of listens to ""Foxhole Confessions"" reveals a confident and able artist well practiced in his chosen genre.

Floyd's a talented writer, with his finger on the pulse of contemporary styles. That means although his songs are decidedly retro in feel, there's nothing old-fashioned or outdated about them. Perhaps that makes them timeless; I don't know, I'll need a couple hundred years to properly make sure. I do know that songs like ""Record Player"" and ""Williamsburg Nights"" deserve to be heard by lots of people. The former is an example of classic, rootsy Southern power pop. Killer hooks collide with crunchy guitars, a monstrous chorus and attitude aplenty. In a just world you'd be able to buy it on 7"" vinyl and wear it out on an old Dansette turntable, but you'll have to download it instead and use your imagination. As for the latter, it kicks in with a superb Stonesy riff before everything falls into place with soulful horns, lots of whoa-whoa backing vocals and Floyd's words, which bring to mind primetime Springsteen and Westerberg, and somehow merge New Jersey and Memphis into one.",1,0.0

""Aphrodite Nights"" was composed for the gourd tree, a unique instrument microtonal instrument invented by Harry Partch, performed by Ryan McCausland.

Produced by Chris Opperman.
Recorded, mixed, and mastered by Stephen Kolakowsky.
Artwork by Tony Akins.
Recorded at the Harry Partch Institute at Montclair State University with special permission from Dean Drummond.

""Aphrodite Nights"" was composed for the gourd tree, one of many unique instruments invented by American composer Harry Partch (1901 - 1974).  The instrument was built on a bough of eucalyptus to which several gourds with bells have been attached, each resonating a different microtonal pitch.

While studying microtonal music at the Harry Partch Institute in Montclair, NJ, professor and composer Dean Drummond showed us some videos of gamelan music that I found to be very fascinating and I decided to compose something that was reminiscent of that style on the gourd tree.

As wonderful, imaginative, and flexible language is, and although words carry tremendous meaning, I often find it difficult to use words to truly attempt to ""explain the unexplainable."" The benefit of instrumental music is that you can communicate feelings and ideas with pure sound, from the world of the wordless into another plane, using music as a way to transport the listener into that plane.

One of the most powerful benefits of music is its ability to conjure up past memories and feelings, and remind them of the past in the present.

""Aprhodite Nights"" is about the wild magic of love and about those moments when two people become lost in one another, each partner being in awe of the other and giving themselves over completely to those feelings, exploring each others minds, hearts, and bodies with equal measures of caution and abandon.  Those evenings when time seems to stand still and that they are the only two beings in existence, subtly guided in their movements by instinct and by the power of the Goddess of Love, Aphrodite, love being the driving force behind existence and creativity.",1,0.0

8670,"Emulating the great Amundsen, Scott and Shackleton in their pursuit of ""furthest south"" I have decided to embark on a similar campaign albeit pejoratively: to identify the worst recording ever made.

In any such quest, Sir Roger Norrington is always going to feature prominently in calculations. In all fairness, the shockers in his discography (as known to me) are legion. His Haydn for instance is banal in the extreme; his Mozart is the musical equivalent of turbo-lax; his Beethoven is comic rather than cosmic; his Brahms induces nausea and felonious indeed is his Bruckner: other than that, he offers a welcome relief from vibrato, orchestral excellence and metaphysics for those so inclined. Much to his anguish, Roger the Hapless has been trumped in my estimation by Mehta whose bone-lazy Wagner lays claim to being Ground Zero (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ring-Hlts/dp/B0000026OJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ring-Hlts</a>). The matter is still in doubt: black holes await investigation, one of them being Sir Roger's survey of Schumann's Symphonies with his long-suffering galley-slaves: the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra (whenever I hear these poor devils. I rethink my position on euthanasia).

Here are ten reasons why this cycle warrants consideration in my quest.

1. 90% of the time, Sir Roger is metrical beyond a metronome. I sense that as a child, he underwent a formative experience with a brass-band from the local colliery: there is no other way to explain his ""oom-pa-pa, oom-pa-pa, oom-pa-pa"" approach to rhythm.

2. Schumann's fever-pitch mania which is so integral to his psyche is muted in each performance.

3. Unrelentingly, phrases are clipped one after another. Roger the Hapless also spurns vibrato with his usual degree of dogmatism. In consequence, every bar is a test of one's stamina.

4. Geez, the strings of the Stuttgart Symphony Orchestra are vin ordinaire with a vengeance. Listen to them in the slow movement of the Spring Symphony: it's moggy central - meow!

5. The Scherzo of the Second is the very definition of note-spinning. I yelled aloud ""FFS Roger - do something with the music!!! Do something! Anything!"" Alas, the great man was too busy worrying about vibrato to respond. Thankfully we all know there is more to this music than this banal account. The slow movement is equally vapid and shallow; not even a tadpole could survive in it.

6. There's no apotheosis at the end of the Second: it's just another fortissimo to Roger the Hapless.

7. Where is the barely suppressed excitement in the first movement of the Rhenish? How is such an omission possible?

8. Mysticism, it is safe to say, is not Roger's strong suit . . . As performed here, the fourth movement of the Rhenish has little to do with the consecration of a cardinal; it's more an evocation of chop suey.

9. Yes Veronica, it is possible to play the first movement of the Fourth as if it's in a major key: that's how little 'fear and loathing' Roger is able to generate.

10. The stupendous transition into the finale of the Fourth - Schumann at white heat - is mundane. It's an embarrassment to compare it with the likes of Furtwangler, Karajan, Szell and Kubelik.

Undistinguished as it is, this cycle offers no real challenge to Uncle Zubin's stupendous achievement: it's more boring and befuddled than sordid. Further afield, Roger's Brahms cycle on Hanssler is actually more horrific than this sorry affair - but who has the wherewithal to revisit such horror when life is so short? Not me!

8718,"""Requiem 3"" is the third in a series of classically-styled piano solos by Canadian/Iranian composer/pianist Fariborz Lachini. In keeping with the theme (a requiem is a piece composed in honor of someone's death), the eight original compositions are slow, reflective, and melancholy, but this is not a dark or depressing album. Always graceful and elegant, this is some of Lachini's most beautiful and evocative music to date. A very prolific composer who has done a great deal of film soundtrack work as well as his own arrangements of Iranian folk and pop music, Lachini has a distinctive style that often reflects his own cultural influences as well as his European musical training - a true world musician! Fellow pianists will delight in the companion songbook, which is also reviewed here.

""Requiem 3"" begins with ""Farewell to Past,"" a somber piece that is sad but not without hope. The extensive use of trills enhances the emotional quality of the piece and gives it a more classical approach. ""Secrets and Dreams"" is strongly influenced by some of Chopin's nocturnes and is a favorite. The emotional nature of the piece touches the heart and evokes a deep sigh. ""Morning Light"" is delicate, hopeful, and very moving. ""Silent Truth"" again hints of Chopin's introspective melancholy with a slowly flowing left hand and poignant melody - another favorite. ""Shadows' Fate"" has a somewhat more tragic quality with an elegant melody and gentle left hand accompaniment. ""Embrace"" is slow, graceful, and very passionate. ""Dilemma"" beautifully conveys the emotional confusion of having to make a difficult choice. Very introspective and again very poignant, it's a wonderful ending to an outstanding album.

Fans of Fariborz Lachini will be thrilled with this newest release, and if Lachini is a new name for you, this is a great way to get acquainted with his music! Recommended!",1,0.0

The 4 bonus tracks are :
1) ""Earth Spirit"" - Australian aboriginal music meets boogie blues via the didgeridoo and vintage electric slide guitar.
2) ""Magnificent"" - caters to the Eastern influence, and has exquisite magical slide playing.
3) ""Blues For Gandhi"" - even more Eastern in flavor and has a strict Indian influence. This composition is performed with the musicians from Ravi Shankar, and features Gerry Joe Weise on opened tuned electric slide guitar, and Indian tuned acoustic guitar, much like John McLaughlin and Shakti !
4) ""Midnight Freestyle"" is a groove beat snare drum played with brushes, and has a question and answering situation between an ancient Dobro guitar and a vintage Stratocaster.",1,1.0

I have videotaped her performances and we have chatted through email. I do not like to disapprove of any artist's product, but this particular CD is not her best.  It has an old feel to it, like recycled 1970's rock, which would not be a bad thing if it was in any way interesting. But it is not.

The lyrics, all in German, may be compelling, but I don't speak German, so I cannot comment on their potency.  However, not knowing the meaning of the lyrics does not necessarily affect the appeal of the whole; other albums all in German are superb, e.g., Freud Euch (In English Bee Happy) In Exkstace (in English, In Ecstacy) as well as Angstloss (in English, Fearless) which has never appeared on CD.  But somehow, this album does not quite cut it.  After playing it a few times, I sold it on Amazon. One day, I may encounter it again and love it. But today is not the day.

8802,"To compensate for their minimal exposure on major labels since the Masur era ended, the NY Phil. has been hugely proactive in releasing Alan Gilbert's concerts on their house label. Every one of them seems to be available as MP3s, and one must admire the sound, which is very fine, all but miraculous considering the acoustic deficits of Avery Fisher Hall. How can it sound so ugly in real life and so lovely through a microphone? Here from October 2009 is #15 of thirty download concerts to celebrate Gilbert's first year as Music Director. The program is a crowd-pleaser featuring the Symphonic Dances from West Side Story, all but immortalized by Bernstein's own version for Columbia Records with this orchestra, and the stomping Suite No. 2 from de Falla's ballet The Three-Cornered Hat,which Bernstein also played the daylights out of.

It's both daring and nostalgic for Gilbert to follow in LB's footsteps, and I wish he had found some swing and sassiness in the West Side Story music instead of the polite, reserved, totally unconvincing performance he actually delivers.  It puts one foot ahead of the other in such a pedestrian way that I can only imagine what the old hands at the Philharmonic were thinking. This is music that defies polite handling - too bad. At least thee are some big, brassy sounds in the Rumble, but it's weak tea compared to Bernstein's knife wielding. conducting this dull is positively un-American.

The Falla is also too polite, lacking any sense of earthiness or flamboyance. This isn't even the Spain of tourist posters, much less of the country's most famous dance piece. There's really no point in detailing a mere walk through. The signs weren't good for Gilbert to light a fire under the Philharmonic, and the only bright spot is that the musicians and critics love him, apparently, which is a change from the dispiriting Masur and Maazel eras.",0,0.0

At one extreme there are superb items such as the Puccini Girl of the Golden West with Tebaldi, and at the other extreme is this poor transfer of the fine Forster version of the St. John Passion.  It is the worst I've heard--the sound level is VERY low, and even when the sound is cranked way up, it sounds muddy and unfocused.  It's awful.  I own the old LP Seraphim version from the 70s, which I remembered as sounding excellent.  I pulled out my much played LPs last night to make such I wasn't nuts--in fact, the LPs have beautiful, clear, detailed sound--they're just noisy from having been played a lot.

IMHO Amazon should withdraw this until something is done about the sound.  They'd be better off with a decent version of this for the same price as the 1964 Richter recording, to which it is rather comparable.  It's disgraceful to see this fine performance subjected to such mistreatment.",0,0.0

8884,"This is a very welcome release.

I never thought of Ninth as a full album. Probably because I only found 7 out of 11 songs actually listenable. The others, however, were his best work ever!

And thats where this release comes in. Of the 6 songs, one is already on Ninth, and a further 2 are unlistenable. However, the remaining 3, plus the 7 on Ninth, that makes for a full, excellent, 5 out of 5 listening experience.

Most artists record more songs for an album than will actually make the final cut. Because half the songs end up not very good. In the case of Ninth it seems, all the songs made it, but across two releases. I can't say that does him any favours, because a lot of people will listen to an album and think 'wtf?' But we can be thankful we have everything now, and make our own 'perfect album' as we see fit.

My biggest gripe with Peter's recent solo work is some bad artistic decisions on the vocals. Until recently, his performances were always flawless. Different... but flawless. He has developed the annoying habit of singing entire songs two or three times, then pasting all the vocal tracks on top of each other, slightly out of time, and very out of tune, with some wild warbles thrown in. Backing vocals should be used sparingly, to emphasize important words or add atmosphere, but if its the entire track, it gets confusing on the ear, and sounds over-produced. 'Secret' and 'Secret Silk Society' suffer extraordinarily badly from this.

When he sings properly though, he has an excellent voice. And its a voice I like to hear. I can't hear how he sings if its diluted by multiple versions of the same thing. However, the song 'Good Works' suffers none of these problems. The voice is clear, solid, passionate, and haunting. The track is so good that I rated the album 4 instead of 3 on this experience alone. It might become my favourite Peter track of all time.

'Secret' isn't vocally pleasing, but its passable, and the song itself is a tremendous feat of writing. Despite the fact it could have been better, I rate it 4.

Then theres the delicious 'Rose Hunter' track. It shines as a perfect companion to the perfect 'I Spit Roses' of Ninth. It has a similar structure, with vocal humming layered underneath a chorus which cuts suddenly with the word 'lovers!' (as opposed to 'spit!) Perfect. Its sung with great passion, and builds throughout.

All in all, 4 out of 5, because it completes 'Ninth' perfectly, and now I feel complete. Peter's work has always inspired me, and I'm so relieved that my confidence in his latest album can remain unscathed.",1,0.0

8903,"We play Christmas music non-stop from the day after Thanksgiving to 12th Night and have an extensive library of Christmas music from which to choose.

This year we choose to seek out new tracks that were either Celtic/Olde World influenced  OR  weren't simply another rendition of the old standbys.

Barra MacNeils ""The Christmas Album"" and ""The Christmas Album II"" provided some great selections. We chose to buy selected tracks and I'll not comment on those we excluded, only the following tracks which we did indeed purchase.

01 - Children's Winter - three stars
.....Pleasing, new to most song. Plays better (for me) as a variation after having been listening to other, more familiar or lively songs.

02 - God Rest ye Merry Gentlemen - five stars
.....A good, traditionalist rendition of a Christmas classic. Gentle vocals, well harmonized and reverently (as is appropriate) performed. Nice 'Celtic' instrumental lead out.

06 - Christmas Comes But Once a Year - four stars
.....Easily meets the 'Celtic Influence' requirement. A real toe-tapping, corner pub song. Enjoyed by all.

07 - Christmas in Killarney - five stars
.....Another 'Celtic' selection. One of the two best songs from the disk - Great song, great recording. Great fun, enjoyed by all.

10 - Galacian Carol - three stars
.....For a non-traditional instrumental, this track plays ok.

11 - O' Come Devine Messiah
.....If you're looking for a secular, happy holiday track then you need to look elsewhere.
.....However, if like me your Christmas is a ""Jesus is the reason for the Season"", this is a MUST HAVE track. Multi-part a'capella rendition of an olde world Advent favorite. Perfect.

Anyways, there is another odd quirk about this soundtrack. None of the songs have endings. Every song just stops abruptly in mid-stride.

8925,"Blue O'Connell - Choose The Sky (Independent)
In 2009, after many years suffering loss of hearing, Blue O'Connell had cochlear implant surgery for her left ear and received a new digital hearing aid for her right ear. Since then O'Connell's busied herself teaching music from her unique perspective and recording her new ""Choose The Sky"" album.

She's a wonderful guitarist, taught by Robert Fripp, no less, and her words are intelligent and moving. You can hear her deafness in her voice, though it's a minor distraction, and combined with gentle finger-picked strings, the effect is always profoundly musical, though not always easy to categorize - like a babbling stream or finger bells, or some ancient `60s free folk design.

Nevertheless, her songs follow narratives and are written to share her stories and experiences. The title track, which also opens the album, sets the tone quite brilliantly, and just in case you've not been paying attention, the records ends with ""To Belong"" which features a lyric that pulls no punches whatsoever. In between you'll find much to love, not least instrumental tracks like ""For the Lily Grows"" and ""Owl's Dream"", both of which are just astounding - like hearing a long lost Davy Graham session for the first time.",1,0.0

8947,"Let me start out by saying that the predecessor to this album, A Violent Emotion, is probably one of my five favorite electronic albums, so I didn't expect this to be able to top it.  However, I never expected it to fall so short, either.

The first track, 'A Nice Place to Visit', kicks off the album rather abruptly with a harsh scream over a pounding beat, but it's pretty much downhill from there.  As soon as the main vocals started I immediately knew this album was going to be a disappointment.  I loved the vocal style on AP's first two albums, but I have to say that on this release they are much hollower and far too weak to pack the same aggression as before.  I read a review somewhere that joked about Daniel Graves having his vocal chords replaced with a frog's, and honestly I can't think of a better way to describe it.

  Then the clean vocals start and made me want to stop listening altogether.  On AVE, the clean vocals were well planned, strong, and worked to perfection.  I honestly don't know what to think about them on this album (see example the title track...), but they seem out of place (and in the wrong genre).  I definitely would consider them a bad move.

  Lest you think the shift in vocal style is my only reason for giving this album a 2/5 (I would rather have given it a 1.5, but that's not possible so...), rest assured I have more problems with it.  The melodies and synth lines are dull and repetitive, sounding like slightly harsher cookie-cutter riffs from some dance track.  The music itself seems to have lost most of its edge, just like the vocals.

  Overall, when listening to this album I continually get the sense that the songs are trying so hard to be as dark, aggressive, and energetic as the cover art would suggest, but in the end they just fall short in every way.  If I had to pick a favorite track, it would probably be 'The Devil's in the Details', as it reminds me of 'Spit It Out', the opening track from AVE.

8953,"I've been a Gloria fan ever since the release of ""Eyes of Innocence"" and ""Primitive Love"" (credited to Miami Sound Machine), and I've observed Gloria mature over the decades, and I've grown a huge fan of the latin music scene (and culture) thanks to her. However, having admired great song like Words Get in the Way, Conga, Oye Mi Canto, Here We Are, Cuts Both Ways, Can't Stay Away from You, Rhythm is Gonna Get you, Destiny, Steel Your Heart, I'm Not Giving You Up, Mi Tierra, Oye, Cuba Libre, Wrapped, Te Amare', No Me Dejes De Querer, Ay Ay Ay Amor, No Llores, and many others, I can't help but say that this album has nothing worth listening to. Gloria might be reaching out for the younger generations, but she is definitely losing some of her old fans. So, let's wait and see how the album does on the market. If sales are good then she has done a smart move to survive, and there will be no harm in losing some old fans on the way. If sales are bad, then she will have lost both.

8959,"Let me start out by saying that the predecessor to this album, A Violent Emotion, is probably one of my five favorite electronic albums, so I didn't expect this to be able to top it. However, I never expected it to fall so short, either.

The first track, 'A Nice Place to Visit', kicks off the album rather abruptly with a harsh scream over a pounding beat, but it's pretty much downhill from there. As soon as the main vocals started I immediately knew this album was going to be a disappointment. I loved the vocal style on AP's first two albums, but I have to say that on this release they are much hollower and far too weak to pack the same aggression as before. I read a review somewhere that joked about Daniel Graves having his vocal chords replaced with a frog's, and honestly I can't think of a better way to describe it.

Then the clean vocals start and made me want to stop listening altogether. On AVE, the clean vocals were well planned, strong, and worked to perfection. I honestly don't know what to think about them on this album (see example the title track...), but they seem out of place (and in the wrong genre). I definitely would consider them a bad move.

Lest you think the shift in vocal style is my only reason for giving this album a 2/5 (I would rather have given it a 1.5, but that's not possible so...), rest assured I have more problems with it. The melodies and synth lines are dull and repetitive, sounding like slightly harsher cookie-cutter riffs from some dance track. The music itself seems to have lost most of its edge, just like the vocals.

Overall, when listening to this album I continually get the sense that the songs are trying so hard to be as dark, aggressive, and energetic as the cover art would suggest, but in the end they just fall short in every way. If I had to pick a favorite track, it would probably be 'The Devil's in the Details', as it reminds me of 'Spit It Out', the opening track from AVE. Honestly, if you're a fan of AP, be prepared for a disappointment, and if you're not a fan (yet) I strongly urge you to start with AVE or the first album Close to Human. Both are far better than this one.",0,1.0

8965,"This release is not without its virtues. The sound is excellent, as is the orchestral work (listen, for example, to the growling lower strings at the end of the first movement of K. 491). There are also some rather interesting cadenzas here, paricularly Faure's fascinating (if anachronistic) cadenza in K. 491. The booklet notes are fine. The author points to the dramatic operatic qualities of the works, paricularly the aria-like quality of the slow movements. And these are the qualities missing from these neat, prettified performances. A friend of mine once aptly observed that Mozart pianissimos should never sound like Chopin's, which is precisely what Primakov's soft-focused playing suggests. To my ears the softness of his touch combined with a reluctance to play anything above a piano produces deadly results. I started with K. 491, and the first movement went reasonably well.  The trouble began with the slow movement, played at a somewhat slow tempo (no problem) and at exactly the same muted dynamic level throughout. It sounded like cocktail music to me. The finale was also slow and also lacking in drama. The beautiful dialogue for piano and oboe made almost no impression because it sounded just like everythinjg else in the movement. For comparison, I turned to Richard Good's excellent performance with Orpheus. What a contrast Goode's clear, focused sound was to Primakov's dreamy tinkling. Still, this performance was superior to that of K. 503.  Once again, the opening movenment was satisfactory.  But the last two movements were awful. The slow movement is ""dreamy,"" the trills barely audible, and any operatic quality entirely lost. The finale was dreadfully dull, with Primakov playing one passage after another without the slightest sparkle or drama. I was disheartened, but I went on and found the last two concertos equally sweet, pretty, and boring. Judging from the excellent reviews this release has received it seems that many people like their Mozart played this way. For such listeners, the present release can be safely recommended, for Primakov's playing is unfailingly ""beautiful."" But if you like your Mozart played with passion and drama, you should go elsewhere.",0,0.0

9105,"I cannot figure out Finnissy. His is winding seemingly disheveled and dissonant music with little obvious structure. Certainly his music is more intended as impression rather than developmental progression. This is supported by there being no format: no sonata, no quartet, no concerto, no symphony, etc. Simply pieces that do not connect with any other movements.

There are bases of logic to the works, however clouded and non-relatable to the layman as they are. Traum des Sangers is based upon a sketch by Caspar David Friedrich depicting a sleeping muse and angels above him. The notes say that the work represents this as two sound worlds, one of the real dreamer, the other of the surreal/unreal celestial element, oddly with the latter musical unit being more clearly structured (more real) than the former. The notes ask ""Who is dreaming who?"". The piece entitled WAM, which are the initials of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, reportedly works fragments of several of Mozart's works which are distorted, though they are so distorted that I can hear none of it. The liner notes refer to several quotes of Mozart: ""In order to be a success one would write stuff that is so inane a carthorse could sing it, or so unintelligible no sensible person could be bothered to work it out"", etc. These quotes represent existential struggles that Finnissy grappled with, whether Mozart was always great, the end-all-be-all one who intimidates composers who follow.  This all suggests that Finnissy was grappling with the accessibility of his own music. But all this results in a piece that is lethargic and aimless music. Mars + Venus considers a Reubens painting of the same name, featuring a man and woman. Finnissy apparently then considers the Mars and the Venus (apparently because of the male-female dichotomy) within us, which are not separable but interact and add. So the piece warps feelings of war and love, again as some non-forward moving, non-developing cloud.

There are numerous discs available with Finnissy's music. So somebody in the academic music community likes him. But you have to ask the age-old question of music: who is it for? Intellectual insiders, or the greater world? Or does an artist create out of what he/she needs to say, without regard to anything else? Certainly the latter is a given. But then don't expect the public to come along. As a layman, I found this disc unsatisfying with nothing that was said understood.",0,0.0

9119,"At last there is a decent recording available of Bernard Herrmann's masterpiece: Moby Dick. It's been a long time coming but it is well worth the wait.

The singers chosen for the solo parts (Ishmael/Ahab) are highly skilled (a requirement for this work). But they also add a strong stamp of character, making the music vividly alive. We can sympathize with Ishmael's wonder and amazement; we shiver with horror and awe at Ahab's ravings; and the tragic role of Starbuck brings tears to our eyes with its stunning pathos. This isn't just a recording - it is a performance. An excellent program of a very difficult piece of music. You will have a new respect for Bernard Herrmann after listening to this.

This reviewer has the opportunity to study the original score in the Herrmann archives at Santa Barbara. This is not an easy piece to play and demands a high quality of player and conductor. The Danish National Orchestra and Choir more than meet those requirements. Under the leadership of conductor Schonwandt, the ensemble delivers an electrifying rendition that holds you spellbound through the entire work. This is not a dull, run of the mill product. Not in the least.

The quality of the recording is just as stunning as the performance: the sounds are clear, powerful, and well defined. It is a pleasure to listen to at all levels.

By all means, if you are a fan of Herrmann's film scores, don't miss this opportunity to hear one of his best off-screen creations. It is a shame that we had to wait more than 36 years after the composer's death to hear it - but it is well worth the wait.",1,0.0
9120,"It almost goes without saying that this version lacks the authority and ""definitive""ness of the original recording, since that was conducted by the composer. Who, unlike a lot of composers, was as good with a baton as a stave, if not better, especially with 20th century music. As an example, Bennie was doing Ives long before that Bernstein fellow kicked off the Ives rush in the late 60's. But the performances here are close enough to the original for chemistry (as my physicist friends say) and the sound is far better--clearer and with xlnt dynamic range. I tried 3 different LP's of the original and the big tuttis (particularly the Amen) overloaded the grooves of every one.

While he get's a couple of the pieces spot on (more than on Disc 3), mostly the performances are lacking in emotion or flawed.  If you're not expecting much considering the price, you may not be disappointed.  Schumann's Romance:  you don't feel Schumann's romance for Clara Wieck, his soon-to-be bride, for whom this piece was likely written.  Poulenc's Les chemins d'amour:  pleasant, but lacking in charm.  Beethoven's Adagio cantabile from Pathtique Sonata:  this is described as a grand expansive movement.  While the performance has its moments, it lacks grandness or expansiveness.  The approach is mostly lacking in heart.  Puccini's Doretta's Dream from La Rondine:  fails to conveys the notion of true love & passion.  Tchaikovsky's None but the Lonely Heart:  lacks the depth of melancholy this song is known for.  Grieg's The Last Spring from Two Elegaic:  lacks the heartbreak on seeing the season of rebirth colored by the possibility that the viewer may not live to see another.  Massennet's Elegie:  strikes the right note here.  Mascagni's Intermezzo from Cavelleria rusticana:  beautiful serene piece played too heavy handed.  Chopin's Prelude No. 15 in D-Flat Major:  low notes lack clarity.  Piano almost sounds like an organ.  Brahm's Waltz in A-flat Major, Op. 39, No. 15:  OK, has some dance-like rhythm to it.  Rachmoninoff's Variation No. 18 from Rhapsody on a Theme from Paginini:  best cut on CD.  Bizet's Habaera from Carmen:  OK.  Has some rhythm and variety of touch.  Ravel's Pavane for a Dead Princess:  fine.  Mozart's Romanze from Andante from Eine kleine Nachtmuzik:  lacking in Viennese suavity.

""At Dawn, Sweet Dawn""), which I first heard on the 1970 vinyl stereo album, ""The Fabulous Osipov Balalaika Orchestra,"" Angel/Melodiya SR-40120 Stereo. That recording was so strikingly beautiful that I have been trying, unsuccessfully so far, to get it digitally reproduced to keep it from disappearing into the limbo of unpreserved and no longer available vinyl recordings. Recently, in another try at a computer search, I was overjoyed to discover this 2007 digital recording made for the BDAA Festival.  When I played it, I was intially pleased that someone recognized the unique beauty of this piece enough to do a more recent recording of it.  But as the performance progressed, I was horrified to find that someone had added an entirely inappropriate trap drum beat, completely ruining the ethereal, poignant, soaring richness of the piece as played by the Osipov orchestra. The composer, Vera Gorodovskaya, was a performer with the Osipov orchestra, which leads me to believe that the Osipov version would be the most authentic - I have no idea how the drum got to be added. I can only hope that, in the future, a new recording will restore the original stunning orchestration and interpretation of the 1970 recording.",0,0.0

There are plenty of melodic hard rock/alternative metal bands out there that sound exactly like this, e.g, Red, Breaking Benjamin, Chevelle, etc. But these guys pull it off just nicely enough to put it right next to those bands separated from the generic stuff like (most of) Thousand Foot Krutch, We As Human, recent Decyfer Down or recent Skillet.

One thing that caught my attention is that there are no ballads to be found, all of the songs are melodic, some with a bit of an edge over the others but nothing that takes you out from the music, kudos for the consistency they showed on this very, very good debut.

It's a terrific set of songs produced by Henri Ren&eacute; that features Harry's usual guitar accompanist, Millard Thomas, plus Tony Scott's orchestra and the Norman Luboff Choir. Musicians include Maynard Ferguson, Bud Shank and Jimmy Guiffre.

Three of these tracks were wittily parodied by Allan Sherman on his 1962 WARNER BROS. comedy debut,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MY-SON-THE-FOLK-SINGER/dp/B000RLLBQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MY SON, THE FOLK SINGER</a>. These are ""Matilda"" (My Zelda), ""Jump Down, Spin Around"" (Pick a Dress o' Cotton) and ""Water Boy"" (Seltzer Boy).

Belafonte receives lyric credits on ""Gettin' Up Mornin',"" ""Troubles,"" ""Noah,"" ""Jump Down,"" and ""Suzanne."" The album's most famous song, the touching ballad ""Scarlet Ribbons,"" was actually recorded in 1952. After Harry toured with it for four years, that old ""Ribbons"" take was included on this Billboard-topping LP. The set-closer, ""Sylvie,"" was written by Leadbelly (Huddie Ledbetter). Although he's not credited on the LP, Leadbelly also originated ""Pick a Bale of Cotton."" (NOTE: One person going all-out could not possibly pick a bale in a single day.)

The general mood here is one of sadness. Even the few upbeat songs have a worrisome undertone: Matilda absconded with the cash; Noah had to build that ark for a rainy reason; Gettin' Up Mornin' is a date with Judgment Day; Jump Down and sweat a pail of water.

The third track at less than 3 minutes is more like a commercial jingle than a song. The 4th track a country cover that nods at the previously mentioned college football team. Then, finally a decent track ""Hey Baby"" after half the record is over. ""This Time Of Year"" you already purchased on the Greatest Hits release. ""Hell No"" you already purchased on the Paper Empire release. The last track which is by far the lamest tribute to the college team of interest includes a puke inducing rap. I know the band is pandering to their hometown, but for other fans, this is an insulting release. If you're content to being a college bar band, keep putting out stuff like this.

9281,"We discovered Lila Downs' music when we were in Baja, can't remember how, but once we caught that voice we were drawn to it and never moved far from it. We bought her CDs and played them in the RV as we drove to the furthest reaches away from Gringolandia those beautiful three months, camping at Playa San Pedrito south of Todos Santos, and many other magical loving places. She serenaded us everywhere, & all up that east coast of Baja above La Paz, among the Mejicanos and cuervos y mar y aire tan dulce. And we don't even speak Spanish, we just sorta picked it up from her soul of song putting us in the mood to understand more deeply the ancient Mexican spirit. Her singing goes right in your chest up to the wrist and squeezes hard, and it feels like you're being drawn out into a realer life. Growing up in Santa Fe as kids we 'd sneak out & spend a lot of time at night sitting along the Santa Fe river listening to the mariachi music from the cantinas nearby, and the best of the singers were the old gals with the gutsy sad and brave voices lamenting lost beauty and passion...Lila learned from some of them, maybe not from Santa Fe, but Mexican sisters, and listening to her took me right back to the summer evenings sitting with my brothers by the river listening through the open doors of the bars... Florinda Anaya looked after us kids sometimes back then in the 40's and she'd sometime take us to the Boys Club onLower  Agua Fria and belt out songs like Lila sings... and she too could turn into a cantadora vieja and sing those songs of lost lust and love, even though she was only 18. Makes me sob a little just thinking about it. Thanks Lila!!!!!

When I looked closely, the copyright said this CD had been made in Argentina. I was in Lima, Peru last year visiting relatives and was shocked to see that virtually every CD store was filled with recordings that had grainy reproductions of cover art, illegibly blurred printing; and burned on CD-R media. Either they are bootlegs, or the manufacturing standards for CDs are far lower than in the US and Europe. I think it would be very helpful if people would comment on the quality of the packaging and the sound quality of any CDs they purchase, particularly from Amazon third party sellers.

I had hoped the boys' interest in pulse-free, hook-free folk tunes was a temporary glitch, but alas, it seems like the new norm. The guys who wrote the folksy bounce of Burgundy and the faux-rocker Indie Rockin' are nowhere to be seen on this collection. Instead, it's more sedate and opaque songwriting, performed with no energy or drive. There's barely anything here that would count as mid-tempo, to say nothing of upbeat.

""Possessed In Billnas"" caught my eye since it is hand numbered and limited to 333 copies (is it really ? That is pretty kult). I also enjoy live CDs as they capture the true, stripped sound of a band. Plus you're usually getting somewhat of a ""best of"". Here, we have  a set that sounds like it was recorded on someone's phone. Most of the music either sounds like:
A) some cruddy, casual YouTube audio
2) someone playing Guitar Hero
Has anyone ever listened to ""Agony In Paradise"" - Possessed's live CD ? That was a DAT soundboard recording which sounds way better than this.
The liner notes from this 2005 recording on the insert state ""Drunkenness, lewdness, blasphemy, and profanity. This album is an uncensored document of all the hell. It's not technically perfect but the energy is there.""
I can completely respect every word of that. And this is coming from someone who enjoys raw, abrasive, unpolished production. But here, it's just too low-fi and unlistenable. Eventually I will move on to another studio release from Incriminated. In the meantime, I will keep listening to ""Miracle Of Purity"".

9345,"Shadowraptr is an indie band from Cincinnati. I had never heard of these guys until recently (more on that later), and I wondered if they were a rap band (given their band name). I couldn't have been more wrong. The band's sound is an intriguing mix of prog rock and funk if you can believe that.

""It's Always Winter On the Moon"" (9 tracks; 43 min.) starts off with the 1 min. instrumental of ""Psychosis in Am Pt. III"", only then to delve into the 6 min. ""Cadavers"", which lays the groundwork for this album, an outstanding, expanding track, led by lead singer/drummer Aaron Collins. The guitar work from Stephen Patota is nice too. Other good tracks include ""Hey Kids! Let's Rap(tr)"", a great funky tune (and again, no rapping). The album concludes with the ambitious 7+ min. ""Psychosis in Am Pt. I and II"".

In all, this is a promising debut album. I saw these guys recently in concert here in Cincinnati, where they played many of the songs of this album, and live it sounded much heavier and funkier than what you hear on here. Can't wait to see them again.",1,0.0

9356,"I have always enjoyed this interpretation and have owned it in many guises,from its domestic and then German LP pressings and most recently as an EMI Great Recordings of the Century CD re-mastered in 2001.  In each case there remained a kind of ""wooliness"" to the sound picture which prevented me from appreciating the beauty of the solo voices  and chorus - which seemed hard and too deeply buried in the fabric of the sound picture - with the result that the New Philharmonia Chorus and Orchestra never seemed fully focused ..at least through my stereo and home entertainment systems.

Thus it was with some uneasiness  that I plunked down almost $50 for this Japanese SACD pressing, which has been around for awhile. I would have done so sooner but I kept hoping EMI would release it as one of its very inexpensive DSD SACD sets of Klemperer material (Mozart symphonies, etc.) which became available domestically in 2012.  In any event  now that I've previewed this SACD pressing my impression is that it may be slightly but not dramatically better than the 2001 CD.  The general sound picture is very similar to that of the earlier CD.  There may or may not be a greater sense of solidity to the image.  My guess is that recent re-mastering processes were not used to upgrade the master tape transfer from its 2001 incarnation so that it was still this 2001 tape that was transferred via SACD to the CD disc.  Solo voices remained slightly ""hard"" and were still somewhat lost in the orchestral sound picture.
Given this, the question then becomes one of  whether this slight possible improvement is worth the extra $$$$.  At best I'd call it a close call.

ADDENDUM:  I've just determined that this Japanese pressing is probably not a SACD at all, which would explain its very small sonic differences with my earlier ""Great Recordings of the Century"" CD that I'd used for comparisons.  MY CD/SACD/DVD/BluRay player has a screen feature in which each disc being played is identified by type (either ""CDDA"" for conventional CDs or ""SACD PCM"". When I checked this Japanese pressing it read  ""CDDA Stereo 44.1K 16B"" which is the same reading I get for my conventional American ""Great Recordings of  the Century"" CD.  Furthermore, nowhere is the Japanese disc identified as ""SACD"" = with SONY's SACD and DSD trademarks in English....Only that it is in ""stereo"".  I've contacted the distributor to call this to their attention and identified two possibilities 1) that they'd mistakenly sent me the wrong pressing, or 2) that they've mis-advertised the type of CD on Amazon...which would lead to more serious consequences.  I've not yet heard from them, and if I don't within the next few days I will contact Amazon to press this complaint for their action.",0,1.0

9359,"Singer/saxophonist and band leader Robert Parker, born in New Orleans, Louisiana on October 14, 1930, is probably better known for his prolific session work than his own recordings having worked with giants like Fats Domino, Huey ""Piano"" Smith, Irma Thomas and, of course, Professor Longhair (real name Roy Byrd), including his 1949 regional hit Mardi Gras In New Orleans. In 1960 he cut his first solo single, the instrumental All Nite Long Parts 1 and II for Joe Ruffino's Ron Records (Ron 327), which also did very well on a regional basis.

But his own hits were sparse, with the best being his vocal Barefootin' which surged to # 2 R&B and # 7 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in May/June 1966 for Nola Records, owned by Wardell Quezergue (March 12, 1930 - September 6, 2011) who, known as ""the Creole Beethoven"" in his native Louisiana, also produced his sides for that label. Released as Nola 721, the flip was Let's Go Baby (Where The Action Is), a tune in keeping with the ongoing Go-Go Dancing craze of the day. After the follow-up Happy Feet/The Scratch went nowhere that same year on Nola 726, he managed to edge onto both charts again in January 1967 with the # 48 R&B/# 83 Hot 100 Tip Toe on Nola 729 b/w Soul Kind Of Loving. In the meantime, he had had his one vinyl LP released titled, naturally, ""Barefootin'"" (Nola LP-1001) containing:  A1. Barefootin'; A2. Let's Go, Baby (Where The Action Is); A3. Mr. Pitful; A4. I've Been Loving You Too Long; A5. Soul Kind Of Living; A6. C. C. Rider; B1. The Scratch; B2. Happy Feet; B3. In The Midnight Hour; B4. Directly From My Heart; B5. Heading For A Fall; B6. I Can't Help Myself.

After that it would be tough sledding as none among the following could get him back on the charts: Secret Service (Makes Me Nervous)/Yak Yak Yak (Nola 733) and Holdin' Out/Caught You In A Lie (Nola 738), both in 1967, followed by You Shaken' Things Up/You See Me (Silver Fox 12) in 1969, Get Ta Steppin'/Get Right On Down (Island 015) in 1974 and Give Me The Country Side Of Life/same song (Island 044) in 1975. In that span, of course, he continued with his busy session work. There may well have been other singles of which I am unaware. You should note that Barefootin' had also come out in 1966 on Head 1050 b/w Shootin' The Grease by Jesse Gresham Plus 3, but the Nola release is recognized as the hit version.

The tracks in this volume are: 1. Barefootin' (2:33); 2. Let's Go Baby (Where The Action Is) (2:28); 3. Mr. Pitiful (2:35); 4. I've Been Loving You Too Long (To Stop Now) (2:53); 5. Soul Kind Of Loving (2:49); 6. C.C. Rider (2:59); 7. The Scratch (2:35); 8. Happy Feet (2:13); 9. In The Midnight Hour (2:30); 10. Directly From My Heart (3:46); 11. Heading For A Fall (2:28); 12. I Can't Help Myself (2:27); 13. Tip Toe (2:28); 14. Secret Service (2:45); 15. Yak Yak Yak (2:42); 16. Everybody's Hip Huggin' (2:46); 17. Foxy Mama (2:46); 18. Holdin' Out (2:32); 19. I Caught You In A Lie (2:40); 20. Barefootin' Boogaloo (2:40); 21. Soul Sister (2:51); 22. Bow Legs (2:40); 23. Boss Lovin' (2:43); 24. Funky Soul Train (2:44).

9371,"R.I.P. Productions (and their alias of Double 99) is the British duo of Tim Liken & Omar Adimora.

With nearly every single they released becoming an underground hit, R.I.P. produced a unique and identifiable feel to every track.  Here are my thoughts and track ratings on R.I.P. Grooves Vol. 1;

1. Move to Jersey  10/10 (Vocal sample with bumpy piano riffs)
2. The Rub (Remix)  9/10 (DnD's ""Diamond Rings"" riff mixed with some female doo-wop vocals)
3. Reach  10/10 (Bumpy Vocal dub UK Garage that's simply amazing!)

Originally released on Ice Cream Records vinyl in 1996, R.I.P. Grooves Vol. 1 is another one of R.I.P. Productions most perfect releases.

9432,"Apparently ""lullaby"" means xylophone and sleigh bells to Twinkle Twinkle Little Rock Star. I love Iron Maiden and was hoping to be able to pass on my love of their music in a way that's gentle to young ears. I wanted to like this album, but couldn't.

The concept is fantastic, but the execution is very poor with the stereotypical and unimaginative arrangement of xylophone/marimba percussion and childish music box sounds. Many of the songs are unrecognizable. Most annoying are the sleighbells. They feature prominently in EVERY single one of the songs. Really? Is this Christmas versions of Iron Maiden or did I read the title wrong? How about some soft guitar or violins, or anything else for that matter?

It's a real insult to the musical genius of the band, one of the most creative and influential bands of our time. They could've done so much with the source material, but instead chose to make a bland, uninspired, and gutless low-fidelity experience. The lack of care to the source material extends down to the cover, which looks like a bad Halloween party poster. They couldn't done a clever child-friendly take on one of Iron Maiden's album art. You can listen for yourself to the samples provided by Amazon and make your own decision. If you have Amazon Prime, you can listen to the full album on your mobile app for free.

KT opened my eyes to a whole new world of music that I hadn't even known exisited...to date I haven't heard a single track that I can honestly say, ""eh its okay"". Every single song is its own.

9441,"I've been a fan of kidneythieves for years and have closely followed all of their releases. Many bands as they continue to churn out albums start to lose the creative touch, their edge diminished. Not so with these guys. This follow up EP to last year's Tryptofanatic is equally brilliant. It's far more melodic and ambient than the heavy guitars and industrial metal riffs that they are known for, but that doesn't mean it doesn't rock. And as always, the highlights are the vocal styling of lead singer Free Dominguez and the philosophical core to the lyrics. It's a journey that will make you bob your head as well as provoke deep thought. Music is in a sad state currently with over-produced, over-hyped cookie cutter bands striving for radio-friendliness. kidneythieves notoriously buck that trend and make the music they want to make.

It's composed of songs that are elemental and joyous, evoking strong images with exceptional musicality, where musical vistas actually come into view, vary and evolve in an orderly progression rather than the endless meandering as is too often the case elsewhere in this genre.
Good new age music is simply jazz in another guise - possibly slightly more focused on the melodic rather than the harmonic content.
LaRoche has a real touch and style that captivates the listener and always impacts the emotions. It doesn't try to overwhelm, but reaches for a fine emotional balance to carry listeners on a personal journey through rich landscapes of pure emotion.
This is truly gorgeous solo piano record of extraordinary recording quality.
You can hear chords echo off of canyon walls and hear the quite of a summer's field. The grandeur of the wide open big sky plains above are ended only by the curvature of the earth below, with lyrical, trickling sounds of coursing streams conjured across such beautiful sounds of grandeur and serenity.

It all shows in LaRoche's careful crafting and ability to vary his style and choice of tonalities. The dynamics are very subtle, even missed a few times until you notice them. Soothing, melodic and dextrous playing that set's this album apart as something very special indeed.",1,1.0

Having seen the quartet play in concert and having listened to all of their recordings, it's  sad for me to see David Finkel leaving the group. The album cover shows him halfway out the door.  I've seen David Finkel play in other ensembles at local chamber festivals and he always takes the lead in focussing the energies of the other players. What the Emerson ""trio"" will do with him gone time will tell us. I feel for the cellist who wants to enter that special micro world of the Emerson Quartet. But who knows.

9461,"X5 has done it again. They have issued a mix of old, re-hashed material from other collections in their ""99"" series and new classical music that is pretty interesting -- at least interesting enough to draw me in at the bargain price as the MP3 Daily Deal on October 14, 2011.

This is almost all excellent music in good to very good performances. If you haven't bought a lot of these collections previously, it is a no-brainer at the special price.

Some number crunching. Based on my own collection -- these numbers may be much smaller or a little larger for you depending on what you've purchased from these sets in the past -- 52 of the 99 tracks here have been released on previous ""99"" sets by X5. A further four tracks are music that has been featured before, but are here in different performances. The remaining 43 tracks are music new to the series.

Among the music that has been featured before are a lot of classical music ""greatest hits"" -- some of the most famous Beethoven piano sonatas, Schubert's Rosamunde string quartet, Brahms' 3rd Symphony, and a good smattering of Mozart, for example.

Within the set of new music, a few things stood out and tipped me over the edge on the decision to buy. Most important was the inclusion of Charles Ives' Violin Sonata No. 2, played by Sweden's Karl-Ove Mannberg and Lena Johnson. X5 is pretty savvy when it comes to capitalizing on what's going on in the classical world, so I imagine they included this because violin superstar Hilary Hahn has just released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/her-own-excellent-album-of-the-Ives-sonatas/dp/B005DWX9YO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">her own excellent album of the Ives sonatas</a>. I was glad to hear the Mannberg/Johnson performance, but I can't say it's my favorite.

Another highlight among the new stuff is the Four Sea Interludes from Peter Grimes by Benjamin Britten, performed under conductor Neeme Jarvi. These are great pieces, although the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/performances-by-Leonard-Bernstein-in-the-last-concert-before-his-death/dp/B000001GEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">performances by Leonard Bernstein in the last concert before his death</a>&nbsp;remain my favorite.

Finally, there are a range of modern tracks by Scandinavian, German and Japanese composers that I found of interest -- pieces by Masakazu Natsuda, Klaus Jckle, Carin Malmlf-Forssling, Pehr Henrik Nordgren, Dag Wirn, Kalevi Aho, Markus Zahnhausen, Erna Tauro, Einojuhani Rautavaara, and Yoshinao Nakada are all well off the beaten path and I was more than happy to pay a couple of bucks to hear this new-to-me music. I can't promise that you'll love all of it -- I didn't either -- but hearing new things is welcome.

Total download size is 938 MB. Bitrates are variable and average 159-240 kbps.

Recommended for anyone at the Daily Deal price. There is a lot of great music here.

A pleasing stew with bits of heavy reverb, oddly tuned horn sections, nice solos and great grooves.

As a thumbnail description: It's a mix of bands. Overall closer to Sunny Ade than Fela. There are also hints of music from other parts of Africa, like Les Bantous de la Capital.

Don't let the slightly lo-fi sound put you off if you like the music in the samples. Go for the musicianship and atmosphere. ymmv.

With the poor status of 4, she really wasn't able to thrive in the way of the diva that she made herself out to be. Her 6th single from 4, Party, feels a bit more lackluster in appeal, than strong from her voice as it could have made out to be. I really didn't like the song that much, and truthfully I think Beyonce' needs to find her voice again. I do wish her well becoming a new mother, but overall her music needs a bit of tuning up.

Cole, feels weak and not really filled with the substance that her fans had definitely hoped from her. I really wasn't very impressed with the song, and felt she had let her voice and drive go.

I have to give this first CD a fairly low rating for multiple reasons.  I guess first and foremost the music is all over the place.  You could probably ask a dozen different people to name a dozen different artists that the CD sounds like, and each could easily do so.  For brevity (instead of naming all the sound-a-likes), Ill just say envision King Crimson with Kate Bush as the lead vocalist.  The CD is not very long at only around 38 minutes, and it basically is just one little snippet of noise after another for the most part - lot of intense angular type noise, with little melodic breaks.  There are no extended melodies.  It sounds as though basically the group went into the studio with the sole purpose of just trying to throw in every kind of abstract, mishmash, gadgetry, off-the-wall soundscape that they could think of (you know the kitchen sink concept).  But to close on a positive note, the reason I said the CD shows promise is because the lead vocalist does have a nice voice and the playing does sound like a nice overall tight ensemble, i.e., good musicianship.  The music basically just needs to be significantly more focused, and the kitchen sink concept needs to be abandoned big time.",0,0.0

This is clearly and unarguably Jon's best work since Yes' Magnification in 2001.  And I would go as far as to say his best solo work ever.  Jon has tapped into something very special with this piece of music.  His spirituality is forefront (as it always is) except now it is delivered by a man who is sure of who he is and the world around him, spiritually.  He has definitely evolved and 'arrived'.  The music is fantastic - developed, well-orchestrated, and filled with depth.

So why 4 stars?  Honestly?  Because as much as I love listening to ""Open"" (and I do, I listen to it often), I am often reminded of just how much MORE this song could have been had it been recorded with YES with a symphony orchestra like Magnification.  I miss full drums (not just percussion), Steve's guitar work, and obviously Chris' bass work.  Had ""Open"" been recorded wtih YES-proper, I don't think it would be an understatement to then rank it right along side of Close To The Edge, Gates Of Delerium, and Awaken because the playing that Steve, Chris and Alan would have brought to the table would have elevated this song into the stratosphere.

But regardless, this is still an inspiring and very fulfilling piece of music that will resonate and travel with me for the rest of my life.

This is no Yes album and the reasons are clear by contrast with ""Fly from Here,"" which is great--but very different in musical direction.  The orchestration on ""Open"" is almost overwhelming and the more sparse arrangements and production more memorable.  Please don't expect the crytalline vocals of 40 years ago--voice is a young man's game and no amount of doubling and other engineering can disguise that.  But Jon's no one-trick pony; he's become an outstanding and well-rounded musician, so the growing compositional abilities more than compensate for diminished vocals.  This is truly a Jon work.

9868,"There are two multi-movement works by Philip Glass and one by Michael Nyman on the new album released by the Sonic Art Saxophone Quartet. Taken as complete wholes, none of the three is outstanding, though there are individual movements within them that are very powerful.

The ""Mishima"" quartet is actually an adaptation for saxophones of a work Glass originally wrote for strings, part of the soundtrack for the movie Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters. Many critics, myself included, often excoriate Glass for the lack of harmonic development in his pieces. Here, however, his stylistic signature does not severely detract from the pieces' sense of forward motion; each idea is repeated, true, but not so many times as to become tiresome. They all share a tone of brooding mixed with quiet menace that is quite striking. It helps that they are short pieces; none of the six movements is longer than three and a half minutes, and the second and fourth are barely more than a minute each.

I've been listening to the string version of ""Mishima"" for comparison, and I think it actually comes off slightly better on the saxophones. The constant eighth-note pulses that are so characteristic of Glass seem somehow more live played on winds, as do the ascending arpeggios. The performers do an excellent job of giving different emphases to each note in a phrase, making the smallest variation truly stand out. The string version, by contrast, has a certain homogeneity that renders the pieces more emotionally distant.

The next work, also by Glass, is simply entitled ""Saxophone Quartet,"" and it is a somewhat strangely organized four-movement piece. The first movement is sad and minor. The main melody carried on the soprano sax is lyrical enough, but the accompaniment is generally uninspired. As a longer work, around five and a half minutes, it does suffer from a bit of that Glassian repetitiveness, as certain segments are heard several times without adding anything to the musical or emotional impact on the listener. The second movement is considerably more energetic and daring (part of the reason why the overall organization of the movements is confusing); it evokes imagery of scaling a great but precarious height, the excitement and tension building and building until a final explosion of melodic energy sends it all tumbling down. The ensemble works together more effectively here; rather than one instrument having the melody while the others play repeating patterns, there is a great deal of trading back and forth, and phrases of powerful homophony as well, particularly towards the end. Unfortunately, the third movement is both the longest and the dullest. It has neither the excitement of the second nor the lyricism of the first. Glass also returns to a much more straightforward arranging technique for much of the movement, with each of the players getting their turn having the primary melody, while the others play the same old interlocking pulse pattern. There is a new melodic idea introduced briefly about three-quarters of the way through, but then it disappointingly leads to nothing more than one more time through the main theme.

Luckily, the fourth movement makes up for the flaws in the rest of the longer work, and then some. It is amazing, probably my single favorite piece by Glass. The stuttering, syncopated rhythmic motive is inseparable from the driving melodic line, that here undergoes actual transformation and development as the piece goes on. The melodic statements are interspersed with swirling loops and turns in a new register and instrument, and these transitions are organic, vital, and varied. Because this movement has some actual structure and meaningful form to it, the restatement of the main theme, when it occurs, feels like an actual arrival, not simply another repetition. The climax features some striking dynamic changes, with sudden quiet moments that are in turn overwhelmed by storms of very fast runs on the bari sax, all leading to a strong and explosive conclusion that hits like a ton of bricks. Why can't Glass write more pieces that are this well put together?

Michael Nyman's collection ""Songs for Tony,"" also a four-movement work, begins very promisingly. In the first movement, Nyman sets up a powerful, swift-moving minor mode riff that juxtaposes the high and low registers of the ensemble. The energy of the original hook never relents, but the melody that emerges and is carried primarily by the tenor sax is surprisingly sensitive and touching. The warm, Renaissance-like concluding cadence is a nice touch as well.

The other three movements, regrettably, never attain the same vitality as the first. They tread by-now familiar sax quartet territory, with melodies and harmonies that are at best clichd and at worst simply plodding. The third movement's main theme is memorable, even catchy, but the transformations it undergoes are unconvincing and ultimately not very, well, transformative. While in the fourth movement, Nyman aims for real subtlety with an extremely quiet main melody in the bari sax, that is only lightly accompanied. The patience required to wait while the piece slowly builds is not rewarded by anything particularly revelatory, however, only more of the same, with an inconclusive, anemic ending that feels more like someone simply shut off the mikes in the studio, rather than a real conclusion.

Speaking of microphones and studios... as someone whose main training is in composition, most of my thinking when I hear a new album goes towards the architecture of the pieces and the like, but of course there are purely production-oriented considerations to take into account as well. The truth is, while the album's performances didn't detract from my enjoyment of the pieces, neither did they enhance it. Although both the playing and the engineering are smooth and competent, with even very subtle key-clicks and the like rendered expertly and audibly, there is a slight lack of crispness to some of the articulations that make already slow pieces bog down a bit. The exception, as noted above, is the rendering of the beautiful main melody of the first movement of ""Songs For Tony."" Which brings me back around full circle, and leads me to conclude that the performances were really dictated by the strengths and weaknesses of the compositions--but that could just be my personal bias.

The Sonic Art Quartet's album is, overall, pleasant but uneven. The second and third works presented have beautiful moments, but in most of the cases there is too much dead air between them to allow the music as a whole to come alive. For fans of the original version of the ""Mishima"" quartet, the reworking for saxophones is worth hearing, and the strongest movements of each of the two other offerings deserve to be entered into the canon of literature for the sax quartet. But there is a great deal of skippable material here as well, and all but the most completionist of listeners will want to acquire individual tracks rather than the whole thing.

The four members of this tight little outfit conjure an amazing range of tonalities and timbres, far beyond what one might consider possible on the saxophone. The unusual instrumentation proves particularly apt for adventurous composers like Philip Glass and Michael Nyman, who are featured on this disc. The group's powerful yet supple sound perfectly evokes Nyman's poignant lyricism and the nervous intensity of Glass' passive-aggressive sonic structures. Intricate, beautiful and hypnotic, this music will take the listener on unexpected and joyous journeys.",1,0.0

9873,"Dear Amazon:

I want a CD version of this album for the following reasons:

1. BIGGEST REASON: When I download the mp3 version to my PC I make a backup using a blank CD. However when I do this and move it to another PC or other device all the tracks show up as track 1, track 2 etc. So I have to go and label all the tracks so I know which one is which. Worst of all there is no picture of the album when I put it into Windows Media player. Yes I actually care that the picture is not there. I know Windows Media player can try and find the picture online but it almost always doesn't find the right one. This is why I want the CD version so bad.

2. When I rip a CD to my computer i want to be able to choose the format it gets ripped in.(mp3, wma, FLAC and so on).
3. CD has better audio quality than the mp3 version
4. I have to install software from amazon that is solely used for downloading the music and I don't like that.
5. If there was a CD version I would have bought this already.

So please, do whatever you got to do to get me a CD version of this available on your website. please do it and I will most definitely buy it. I prefer all my music to come from it's purest source. the CD. I don't care if it costs a bit more I'm totally fine with that. If you can't do this than please tell me where I can get the CD version.

9894,"I'm a fan of Reich, but I never liked the Triple Concerto and found Different Trains to be a bit taxing, though the first part of its three has held my interest over the years.  Here, the Triple Quartet sounds harsh.  Now, harshness is a quality that might actually be a great addition to Different Trains considering the subject matter.  In this particular instance, that harshness continues but somehow the sound lacks depth.  I don't hear the trains in the music as I do on the version from the Different Trains/Electric Counterpoint album.  Maybe I'm just partial to the versions I heard originally and new ones just don't compare.

In any case, the whole point of my review is the stunning Piano Counterpoint.  This piece is new to me and this might be the only place where it's been recorded.  Vincent Corver's arrangement brings tremendous life to Reich's style.  It's as if he really ""gets"" Reich.  Dare I say he might have even improved on it?  This is a lively, happy, well-played and enjoyable piece and out of character with the rest of the music on this album.  Because you can buy each track individually, I opted to buy just this one and I'm very happy to hear it bouncing off my walls.  If you're a Reich fan, don't miss this stunning track.  2 stars for the album, 5 stars for Piano Counterpoint.",0,0.0

Confusingly, this 3-volume set is not the same is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elektra/dp/B004AE402G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elektra</a>&nbsp;3-volume set of the same name, from 1958-59.  Instead it appears to be a rag-bag of tracks drawn principally from two albums:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flamenco-Fantasy/dp/B001O0HZDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flamenco Fantasy</a>&nbsp;(1960) and the double-album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sabicas-in-Concert/dp/B0013KSL3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sabicas in Concert</a>&nbsp;(1972)

As to Vol. 2, ""Alambra"" should be ""Alhambra"" (the Moorish palace in Granada).  El Pillallo (or Piyayo, 1864-1940) was a well-known and popular singer/guitarist from Mlaga.  The occurrence of two pieces with the same title but different styles seems to be an oversight on Sabicas's part, as his titles were usually unique.

It's nearly all good stuff, if you don't mind the albums being garbled together.  Since Amazon doesn't list the flamenco styles of the tracks, I do so below:

01. Rondea Llanto Minero
02. Tarantas Llanto Minero
03. Buleras

9920,"One of the true unsung artist of his era. This is his second album as leader and is on the renown Blue Note Label. Trying to find this on vinyl is all but impossible. But thankfully Blue Note finally found the lost tapes and reissued this on vinyl sometime back.

Track Listing:

1  Good Old Soul
2  Up Tight's Creek
3  Theme For Doris
4  True Blue
5  Miss Hazel
6  Nothing Ever Changes My Love For You

The Sextet:

Tina Brooks - Tenor Sax
Freddie Hubbard - Trumpet
Duke Jordan - Piano
Sam Jones - Bass
Art Taylor - Drums

Recorded 1960 on the Blue Note Label. This reissue carries catalog number 4041.

Review:

As with Minor Move and Back to the Tracks, Tina Brooks' True Blue is an album of hard bop excellence. Recorded in '60, it finds the tenor saxophonist accompanied by Freddie Hubbard on trumpet (a week after Brooks helped Hubbard on his debut album, Open Sesame), Duke Jordan on piano, Sam Jones on bass, and Art Taylor on drums. The six original compositions by Brooks are well-crafted, though none are stellar. The group's cohesive sound, its consistent blues-induced jazz groove, and the numerous well-defined solos are the album's strengths.

You'd never know it from listening to his distinctive tone and melodic attitude, but Brooks never made it big. Though he recorded four albums for Blue Note, True Blue was the only one that was released during his lifetime. I'll health and drugs eventually took their toll and he passed away in '74 at 42 years of age.

There is a terrifically pensive blues cry in every Brooks solo on this release that is mesmerizing. While he's often shadowed by trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, the two gracefully bring out some profoundly thoughtful improvising from each other. None of the five tunes (and two alternative takes) are exactly inspiring tunes. But Brooks packs a lot of raw emotionality and innovative musical craft into his solos. Although the liner notes makes much of the Sonny Rollins influence, I actually hear a lot more of a tone I'd connect to Booker Erwin, Ornette Coleman, or Brooks' companion in the Blue Note recording studio, Jackie McLean. Anyone who enjoyed the dramatic support Brooks gave McLean on Jackie's Bag should treasure this, the only album Brooks released under his name as leader during his lifetime. Brooks sounds like a desperately driven musician wanting something beyond the bop of 1960 and never quite making the breakthrough to freedom that McLean found through his association with Ornette Coleman. The rhythm section of drummer Art Taylor, bassist Sam Jones, and pianist Duke Jordan simply never push him that hard to explore new musical territory. I wonder who Brooks would have become had he worked with a drummer like Eddie Blackwell or Elvin Jones.

What True Blue gives generously is a full blooded musical portrait of a hard-working and distinctive sounding tenor man with a blue cry stuck in his throat and heart. It is an achievement to treasure.

End Review:

I could not agree more with the above two reviews. If you do not have Tina Brooks in your jazz library, you have missed on of the all time greats. While Tina Brooks does not have a large body of work and he ceased recording in 1961, ""True Blue"" remains on of those tour de force recordings to be treasured forever.

9965,"McCombs' `The Same Thing' is an interesting track.  There are moments, especially towards the chorus breakdown where it sounds like a stolen beat from a 70's sitcom.  There are moments when the vocals reach a fluidity that causes the words to meld together to the point where it doesn't sound like English anymore.  The base musicality has a bouncy folksiness to it that resembles a down-tuned Mumford and Sons.  The lead vocal is slightly too monotone to illicit a direct response from the eardrums, but then again as he speaks in tongues and rips off a whistle for a beat he resembles a smoothness reminiscent of famed hair bands of the 80's.  The overall sound is extremely dated though.  At the end of the day, `The Same Thing' feels too uneven for its own good, and it certainly outstays its welcome by stretching itself over six minutes in length.  Still, there is something interesting at play here.

I don't really like this, but I'm intrigued enough to listen to more.",0,0.0

9967,"Every once in a  while you come across a song that really touches your heart and stays with you for a long time. ""Wait for Me"" is worth being a part of your favorite all time music. It really has all of the best elements to make a perfect listening experience. I listen to a lot of new music and when I heard this song I was certain I had to buy it.",1,1.0
9968,There's nothing I like to hear more than well put-together records now-a-days and this one is just that....pieced well together! The lyrics ring true to the theme 'unity and division' and the music takes you on journey winding up and down the spectrum. Definitely their best to date and a great recording at that! Keep it coming !!!!,1,1.0

9970,I bought this app and paid 2.99. It is a good app but it only work for 1 month. I tried to contact the support but they don't respond. Save your money and don't buy this app. They will just take your money and run. It's a bad business. Let it be a warning to all who wish to buy this app.,0,0.0

9973,"Eric Roberson's song ""At The Same Time"" is the definition of dreamy. It has nice vocals, production and the lyrics are relatable to anyone who is loving someone that just isn't loving them. I've actually never heard the song before today but it's one of those tracks that you probably wouldn't want to skip over on your iPod if it came on.

Nice job, Eric.

9986,"I am Very Disappointed.  What I assumed I was getting was the whole 7 disc box set that comes in 3 fold up parts, and only ended up getting ONE of the 3, which contains 3 of the 7 discs.  There was no description to Describe that it was only an incomplete part of the whole box set, and only 1 picture!!  So very disappointed!!

The only plus is that it's Pearl Jam, and it is extremely hard to go wrong with Pearl Jam.

But now I have to shell out even more, in order to get the Whole Box Set, which I will now have a redundant 1/3 of it.",0,0.0
