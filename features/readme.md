# Handcrafted features

All features are defined in the [`handcrafted.py`](https://github.itu.dk/frph/2ndyearproject/blob/master/features/handcrafted.py) module. To build any dataset with these features, run [`featurizer.py`](https://github.itu.dk/frph/2ndyearproject/blob/master/features/featurizer.py).

It currently defaults to making handcrafted features on the movie review dataset.
