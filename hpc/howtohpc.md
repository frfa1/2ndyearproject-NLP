# Using the HPC on ITU

## 1. ITU network needed

You can either physically be on ITU premises or remote access the ITU network via Forticlient.

If using Forticlient, use normal itu credentials

## 2. SSH connection

Then ssh onto the HPC with

`ssh frph@hpc.itu.dk`

It is a **very** good idea to do this through VS code (use bottom left icon and then "Connect to host...") as it makes moving files on the HPC much easier

where frph is replaced with your own credentials.
